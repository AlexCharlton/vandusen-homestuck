<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rose, sorry to say but this is all looking kind of silly!</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm trying to spread the upward construction around so there is a more substantial foundation for later on.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I'm starting to wonder if it will be strong enough.</span>
