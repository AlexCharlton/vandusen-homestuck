AT: pROBABLY MEANT TO ANTAGONIZE ME,

AG: What are you talking a8out. Look at my 8eatiful 8uilding. Don't you think it's a8out time someone got a little cre8tive with this game????????

AT: uMMM, mAYBE,

AG: Everyone always wants to do things the 8oring way.

AG: Didn't we make a truce, Tavros? That we would try to 8e less 8oring from now on?

AG: You don't want to 8reak your truce with me, do you Tavros?

AT: nO,

AG: Gr8. Now get clim8ing!

AT: pLEASE DON'T READ THIS AS,

AT: a BORING THING, i HOPE,

AT: bUT,

AT: iT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT, mOSTLY,

AG: Man. I knew it. Toreasnooze is 8ACK IN ACTION.

AT: wHY DON'T YOU, iN LIKE,

AT: a NOT BORING WAY, bUILD,

AT: mORE INCLINED SURFACES, lIKE YOU DID OVER THERE,

AT: mAYBE YOU COULD COLOR THEM, wITH FUN COLORS,

AT: sO YOU WON'T THINK THEY'RE BORING AND GET ANGRY AT ME SOME MORE,

AG: I 8uilt that ramp 8ecause we were in a hurry to save your life, remem8er?

AG: A dead Tavros is even more 8oring than an alive and crippled Tavros 8y a slim margin.

AG: My stair structure is lovely and I'm not changing it.

AG: Now hop out of your wheel device and get clim8ing!!!!!!!!

AT: uHH,

AT: cLIMBING,

AG: Or crawling. Whatever! Stop 8eing so helpless. It's pathetic.

AT: iT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME,

AG: What's the rush! You're in the game, safe and sound. Look in the sky. Do you see any meteors? I sure don't!

AT: bUT, tHERE ARE IMPS AROUND,

AT: aND i'LL BE SORT OF DEFENSELESS,

AT: lYING DOWN ON STAIRS,

AG: Siiiiiiiigh.

AG: You did not just use that excuse. We 8oth know you can commune with these things.

AG: Hey! Why don't you psychically command them to carry you up????????

AG: Oh my god that is a gr8 idea. Once again, leave it to Vriska to come up with the cre8tive solutions.

AT: i WOULDN'T REALLY,

AT: WANT TO MAKE THEM DO THAT,

AT: i JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, wHY,

AT: wE CAN'T DO THIS THE EASY WAY,

AG: What good would that do you?

AG: Whatever the purpose of this game is, it makes you work hard for it!

AG: That way you 8ecome stronger along the way and you are 8etter prepared for whatever's next.

AG: Remem8er when we used to flarp together???????? It was the exact same principle. And that's why you were always outmatched! You were too soft and not well prepared.

AG: Nothing comes easy, Tavros. That is why we go through the trials in the 8rooding caverns when we are young.

AG: To make sure we are strong when we come out!

AG: Do you remem8er the trials, Tavros?

AT: nOT VERY WELL, nO,

AG: Well, I do, and they were a 8itch.

AG: 8ut now that I think a8out it, it would make perfect sense if your trials were really easy 8y some mistake.

AG: That is why you are such a soggy phlegm sponge, and why you got picked 8y such a sad, frail little lusus!

AT: }:(

AG: 8ut that's ok, it pro8a8ly wasn't your fault. Just a 8ad 8r8k!

AG: You're lucky you have me as a server player, so I can challenge you and help you get strong.

AG: Now hop out of that seat and get clim8ing! I will deliver the device to you once you are at the top.

AG: Clim8, Pupa!

AG: Cliiiiiiiiim8!

AT: mAYBE i SHOULD ASK TINKERBULL ABOUT THIS,

AT: hE'S REALLY SMART, nOW THAT HE CAN TALK,

AG: No!!!!!!!!

AG: You don't need help from your lame 8ull fairy. He is only holding you 8ack.

AT: hE'S MY FRIEND,

AG: God. Pathetic.

AG: This is getting frustrating.

AG: Why did I have to get stuck with the cripple? Just my luck.

AG: Do you have any idea how inconvenient this is? Do you have any sympathy for what I'm dealing with here?

AT: uHH,

AG: You're so inconsider8. You just sit there looking smug. It's infuri8ing to look at you.

AG: You haven't even thanked me! Or apologized for that matter!!!!!!!!
