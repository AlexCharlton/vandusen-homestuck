TT: Where you at, man.

TT: Wait.

TT: Which computer are you using?

TT: I'm not comfortable knowing my words could be hovering over Cage's clownish, sort of gaunt face.

TT: Could you maybe switch back to naked blue chicks as your exclusive desktop fodder? TIA.

TT: But yeah.

TT: I don't know if you just want a little solitude.

TT: Or if maybe you finally just got like,

TT: A case of Strider fatigue.

TT: I could understand that.

TT: I mean, not to get all neurotic on you.

TT: I'm just saying I get it, if that's what's going on.

TT: But for real, if you gotta sneak away for a few days, that's cool.

TT: Just might be kind of dope if you at least would let me know which planet you scurried off to.

TT: And by dope I guess I mean considerate?

TT: Really not trying to be a drag here.

TT: Wondering what's up is all.

TT: Want to meet up soon?

TT: I found a really promising tomb we could raid.

TT: Looks like it runs hella deep.

TT: If I've got the specs right, could run as deep as the Lion's Mouth itself.

TT: But without all the fuckin' fire to deal with.

TT: Wait, I mean Lion's Mouth.

TT: Gotta underline that key shit. Always forget.

TT: Figure it should take a couple days to make it to the bottom.

TT: Only a day if we both go limp and just fall the whole way down the stairs.

TT: Ignoring literally every sage warning we've ever received about those treacherous plummetation zigzags.

TT: Just tumbling on down in a floppy limbed trance like a couple of puppets in a race arranged by some drunk gamblers.

TT: If you're into another expedition, head to LOTAK and hit me up. Just don't forget your mask this time.

TT: The deeper we go, the worse it gets, remember?

TT: Could be some unreal grist down there.

TT: More puzzle shit.

TT: Loads of skeletons.

TT: Pack your guns dog.
