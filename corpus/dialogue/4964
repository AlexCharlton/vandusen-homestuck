<span style="color: #005682">AG: You were 8razenly inserting yourself into Jade's history. The self-insertion plan was my idea, and it's revolting and cowardly for you to deny it.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hahahaha, sure. Whatever you say.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's incredi8ly sad how outclassed you are. It's actually depressing that you thought you could 8eat me at my own game. And then most sickeningly of all, you don't own up it!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's a shame you're not strong enough to take him on with me. Too 8ad you spent so long sleeping instead of tur8o-leveling like me.</span>
