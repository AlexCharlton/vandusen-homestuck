GG: Your "portrait" is every bit as abysmal as I was expecting. And for the last time. I AM NOT FAT.

GG: I think your claims of attraction to heavyset women, which you present as "flattery," is an obvious ruse to get me to feel insecure about my appearance, and it isn't going to work!

uu: OINK.

GG: SHUT YOUR STUPID FACE!!!

GG: UGH, THIS BIRTHDAY IS SO AWFUL! I CAN'T STAND IT!

GG: WHY IS EVERYONE TREATING ME LIKE SHIT TODAY?

GG: WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?!

uu: YOU WERE. WAIT. WHAT'S THE CONJUGATION ASSOCIATED WITH "HUMAN BIRTH"?

uu: IS IT. HUMAN BORTH?

uu: YOU WERE HUMAN BORTH.

GG: SHUT UP!

GG: I'M DONE HUMORING YOUR PERVERTED ADOLESCENT MIND GAMES!

GG: TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO CALLIOPE!

GG: CALLIOPE!!!

GG: WE WANT YOU BACK! PLEASE COME BACK AND SPARE US FROM THIS LECHEROUS NINCOMPOOP!

GG: CALLIOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

GG: WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK?!

uu: SAYING HER NAME ONLY WAKES HER UP. IF SHE'S ALIVE.

uu: SO YOUR HOG FACE CAN SNORT THE DIRTY SYLLABLES ALL IT WANTS. HELL, I WILL EVEN GIVE YOU A HAND!

uu: CALLIOPE! WAKE UP SIS!

uu: HAA HAA, WHOOPS. SHE CAN'T.

uu: THE BITCH IS DEAD!

GG: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

uu: NO IT'S TRUE. I GOT SOMEBODY TO STAB HER A LOT.

uu: THEN I STOLE HER BLOOD FOR MY LETTERS.

GG: NO!!! THAT CAN'T BE TRUE! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE EVEN YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE!

uu: JANE BITCH. YOUR PREPOSTEROUS FEMALE EMOTIONS ARE GOING EARTH BANANAS AGAIN.

uu: SETTLE DOWN AND LISTEN TO BOY REASON. DO NOT MAKE ME DEMONSTRATE THE VERACITY OF MY FACTS. YET AGAIN.

uu: THAT SACCHARINE TRAMP IS SUCH A GONER. SHE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

uu: JUST LIKE YOUR DAPPER HUMAN GUARDIAN.

GG: WHAT?? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY FATHER!

GG: WHERE IS HE?

uu: HE'S FUCKING DEAD IS WHERE.

GG: YOU'RE LYING AGAIN!!!

GG: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!

uu: GOD. I'M TRYING TO.

uu: MY FACTS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY PENETRATING YOUR HYSTERICAL ATTITUDE. LISTEN TO ME VERY CLOSE.

uu: HE WAS CAPTURED BY AN AGENT SOON AFTER YOU BEGAN YOUR QUEST. HE WAS THEN PUT IN JAIL ON DERSE.

GG: Ok...

GG: So he's on Derse, then?

uu: BITCH, YOU AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM ON DERSE?

uu: IT ISN'T LIKE THE SOFT TIME YOU DO ON PROSPIT. I BET YOU NEVER SPENT ANY TIME IN THE JOKE THEY CALL A SLAMMER THERE. LET ALONE ON DERSE.

GG: And I suppose you have??

uu: I WAS NOT VERY WELL BEHAVED. I DID MORE THAN MY SHARE OF TIME. CHAINED TO THE WALL OF A CELL.

uu: HEE HEE! LIKE I WASN'T SO USED TO THAT. I WAS LIKE. DO YOUR WORST.

uu: AND THEN THEY DID. DERSITES DO NOT TREAT THEIR PRISONERS GOOD. TO SAY THE LEAST!

uu: I WAS ONLY ABLE TO SURVIVE THE BRUTALITY. DUE TO MY EXCEPTIONAL CONSTITUTION. AND EVEN TO SOME EXTENT. MY ABILITY TO ENJOY ANGUISH.

uu: BUT YOUR PATHETIC, FRAIL HUMAN "DAD" IS A DIFFERENT STORY. THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL. THAT HE IS DEAD BY NOW!

GG: No. Don't say that. Shut up!
