TT: I was talking to someone.

TG: who

TT: You remember the trolls?

TG: yeah

TT: One of them messaged me, so I indulged him/her/it for a moment.

TG: oh i see you opted to chat up one of those dbags instead of talk to the guy who saved you from a swirling shitstorm of angry flaming wizards

TG: i was worried your priorities might have been out of whack but no i was dead wrong

TT: I also took a moment to check on John.

TG: how is he

TT: I can't see him anymore. Just his empty house.

TT: But I did talk to him briefly.

TG: i should probably text him soon

TG: see whats up

TG: because

TG: i love him

TT: I know.

TG: so this place youre at now

TG: its the same place hes at right

TT: It's hard to say for certain.

TT: But I think I like it here.
