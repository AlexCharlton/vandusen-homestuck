GG: WHY???

uu: MY POWER HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY SINCE I LAST JEERED YOU.

uu: I HAVE MADE REMARKABLE STRIDES ON MY SACRED JOURNEY TOWARD IMPORTANT ADULTHOOD.

uu: ON THIS BULLSHIT PLANET. WHICH USED TO BE YOUR HOME.

uu: I HAVE FOUND MANY KEYS. AND UNLOCKED MANY HOLES.

uu: AND NOW I CAN SEE MORE. AND LEARN MORE. THAN YOU COULD EVER FUCKING DREAM!

GG: How wonderful for you.

GG: I don't care how all-seeing and all-powerful you think you are.

GG: If your intent is to waste my time with more of your pitiful bullying, you are out of luck.

GG: Because that is exactly NOT the sort of crap I am in the mood for today.

GG: Toodle-oo!!!

uu: WAIT!

uu: I THINK I GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT.

uu: HOW ABOUT WE. GNAW THAT ONE OFF AND START OVER?

uu: I WAS TRYING TO PAY YOU A COMPLIMENT.

GG: ??

uu: MY PEOPLE AREN'T MEANT TO LIKE ANYBODY. GET IT?

uu: I MEAN, NOT THE WAY HUMANS DO. WE DON'T HAVE THE HUMAN EMOTION CALLED "LOVEKHEKLFSDKF". AND WE SPONTANEOUSLY START MASHING KEYS. WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO EVEN TYPE THE WORD.

uu: ALL OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE DICTATED BY THE MIRACLE OF HATRED. SO WHEN I USE BAD WORDS TOWARD YOU. THAT'S JUST ME SAYING THINGS TO TRY TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

uu: LIKE. "SOCIALLYUOIPY".

uu: AS A.

uu: *SHUDDER*

uu: A... "FRIENDJISJFDJISJSDKFLDJSDKLJF".
