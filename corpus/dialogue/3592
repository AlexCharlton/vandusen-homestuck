TG: wow ok

TG: youre a little early

TG: but thats fine i guess

TG: also you suck at rockets

EB: ARGH!

TG: what

EB: she tricked me again.

TG: who

EB: GC.

EB: she told me how to get to the 2nd gate.

EB: so i went through, but it took me to rose's house instead.

EB: another prank!

TG: dude you did go through the second gate

TG: i mean i dont know why you would listen to her again

TG: kind of moronic but thats a whole other issue

TG: she didnt trick you this time

EB: oh...

EB: then, i don't really get this.

TG: what were you expecting

TG: this is how it works

TG: the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing

TG: cycling through each planet

TG: gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses

TG: then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on her planet

TG: you look for gate 4 somewhere there

TG: which leads to gate 4 above my house

TG: and so on

EB: wow, ok.

TG: ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1

TG: but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously

TG: and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was built up

TG: so you wouldnt fall to your death

TG: but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine

TG: see we all got to coordinate on this thing

EB: ok...

EB: how do you know all this?

TG: fuck

TG: come on dude

EB: oh yeah...

EB: you're the orange dave.

EB: hey no offense, but do you think i could talk to the real dave for a second?

TG: god dammit

TG: i am the real dave

TG: you know the one who saved your life

TG: im more real actually cause ive been through some heavy shit already hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year

TG: and grinding shit out for your ungrateful ass

TG: here look check out this code from the future not that you deserve it WIin189Q

TG: youre fucking welcome

EB: wow, calm down!

EB: i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant...

EB: i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is...

EB: the dave from my time is also my friend, and i guess he's in the same boat i'm in, not knowing stuff and all.

EB: and i'd feel bad keeping him out of the loop!

TG: yo

EB: oh, hey.

EB: i think i pissed off your future self.

TG: what did you do

EB: i said he wasn't the real dave.

TG: ahahahahaha

EB: i think i might have really hurt his feelings though!

TG: pff

TG: dont worry about it

EB: why not?

TG: cause i wouldnt give a shit

TG: and hes me

EB: ok.

EB: i'm in rose's room by the way.

TG: what

TG: really

EB: yeah, but she's asleep!

TG: ok

TG: dont go anywhere

TG: im coming down to the computer

EB: ok.



TG: dave is here he wants to use the computer

TG: probably to help you scope out roses room and snoop and stuff

TG: i mean thats what i would have done

TG: if you were alive

TG: so im gonna go

TG: use these flappy ghost wings and tear shit up in space or something

EB: sure!

EB: hey dave...

TG: what

EB: in case i forgot to say so before...

EB: thanks for saving my life!

TG: yeah
