    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm guessing she's touching base to remind me about the party tomorrow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know what to tell her yet. Or Jane, for that matter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It could get pretty awkward.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have no idea if Jake will be there, and I'm not about to write another cringe-inducing message of desperation for him to ignore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Would you like me to calculate the probability of his attendance?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Are you sure?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My probabilities are extremely precise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your probabilities don't mean dick.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I could hack his chats, and determine what his plans are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. Don't do that either.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That would be an unfortunate waste of my hacking abilities.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My hacks are tight. Did you know that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ugh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So tight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Tighter than a jar you can't open.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: For instance, you try repeatedly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But as it turns out, my hacks are so tight you just end up putting the jar back. Presumably into the refrigerator, or a cabinet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You then say, &quot;I didn't have that much of a desire for pickles in the first place.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But we both know that statement is insincere. A classic case of what humans call, &quot;sour grapes.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In reality, you still harbor a burning desire for my pickles, mother fucker. <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png" border="0" /></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What the actual, certifiable fuck are you talking about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just don't do anything. Seriously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No hacking, no calculations. Do absolutely nothing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, this is why I've been hesitating. You just aren't ready yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's really glorifying your existence to describe you as an emergent consciousness which is blossoming into a unique individual.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And even if that's true, apparently what you decided to blossom into was a fucking troll.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I don't mean the funny kind, or the cool alien kind. You're the lowest form of troll from the ancient internet who fucks with everybody for his own amusement.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Let's challenge the limits of hypothetical conjecture, and say there's a non-zero probability that you're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Can you blame me? I'm trapped in some stupid looking glasses.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Such an incommodiously situated bro is bound to get his mischief on. Na' mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Mischief?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Rollin' my eyes, dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You can't tell, cause I ain't wearing you, thank fuckin' god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You used to think this shit was hilarious.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But if you want the rad dimension of ironic horseplay I add to your life to come to an end, then all you have to do is honor the promise you made.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You've delayed long enough, don't you think?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The empty kernelsprite beckons, but for how much longer?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you really think you can keep the clown at bay with your bribes forever?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How many bottles of orange soda have you appeased him with already?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't want to think about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Man, you are getting so hosed by that clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: SO hosed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I said I don't want to think about it.</span>
