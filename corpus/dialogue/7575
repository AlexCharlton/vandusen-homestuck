    <span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sounds straight forward enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whats the code?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT IS:</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: uROBuROS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BE CAREFUL. THAT IS CASE SENSITIVE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I WOULD TELL YOU THE CODE FOR MY SISTER'S JUJU. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: A WHILE AGO I WENT TO GET HER JUJU. BUT THE FUCKING THING WAS GONE ALREADY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I THINK THE CRAFTY BITCH ALREADY GAVE IT AWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: We could try to guess it maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: FORGET IT. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE PROBABLY INFINITE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah. Youre probably right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So what sort of magical properties does your juju have?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I HAVE NEVER TRIED IT. BECAUSE IT WAS TOO PRECIOUS TO ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHATEVER MINE DOES. MY SISTER'S PROBABLY DOES THE OPPOSITE THING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT WHAT THEY DO INDIVIDUALLY. PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT THEY CAN DO TOGETHER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHEN COMBINED. THE JUJUS BECOME THE MOST MAGIC THING EVER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THEY CAN MAKE ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE. AND EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WILL MAGICALLY FALL INTO PLACE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That sounds almost too good to be true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If you dont even know what your juju does by itself why do you think they do that together?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WITH ALL MY FUCKING HEART. YOU STUPID PIECE OF SHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh why didnt you say so! Thats all i needed to hear!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: See youre getting the hang of hope already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YEAH. I GUESS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE BOTTOM LINE IS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: JUST TAKE MY JUJU. HAVE FAITH IN YOUR PATRON DUDE. AND LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Roger that mr lord.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Say. Dont you have a name? We know your sisters name... cant we know yours now too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU SHOULDNT KNOW ABOUT ME. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IF YOU KNEW THEM. IF YOU EVEN KNEW MY NAME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YOU WOULD SHIT YOUR PANTS HARDER THAN ANY HUMAN EVER HAS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO YOU MAY CONTINUE REFERRING TO ME AS YOUR LORD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well i surely dont want to spoil any clean trousers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Even though your warning sounds a little hyperbolic i will trust you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um. My lord.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Heheheh when i call you that people could mistake our conversation for a nefarious and underhanded collusion among felons!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SHUT THE FUCK UP.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: As you wish... MY LORD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: HEHEHEHEHEH!</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So lord. May i ask...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why are you giving me your juju if it is so dear to you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is your commitment to this manbro boypledge of yours really that strong?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If so im really impressed. I would have a really hard time giving my favorite stuff away to a total stranger.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THE GESTURE IS RELATIVELY MEANINGLESS. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I HAVE FOUND A NEW JUJU. A MUCH BETTER JUJU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: A JUJU THAT MAKES ALL OTHER JUJUS LOOK LIKE FRIVOLOUS CHILDISH NONSENSE IN COMPARISON.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah? Then that is quite a treasure you found.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where did you get it? Did you plunder a tomb or such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SORT OF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT WAS EXCAVATED FROM THIS PLANET'S SOIL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: ALONG WITH SOME OTHER ARTIFACTS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND GIVEN TO ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BY MY INFURIATING ASSHOLE MENTOR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: A MAN WHO IS AN INVINCIBLE CLOWN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well that sounds nice of him. He cant be that much of an asshole if he gave you such a nice present can he?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NO, BELIEVE ME. HE CAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I had a clown give me a nice present once too. I would never have met my good friend mr erisol without the kindness of that clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YEAH. IT'S THE SAME FUCKING CLOWN SOMEHOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I'M TELLING YOU. THIS ASSHOLE IS ETERNAL. AND THE BEINGS HE CREATES FOR YOUR PARTY ARE DISGUSTING ABOMINATIONS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO? NOTHING, I HAVE LEARNED. HE'S A CLOWN. THE RULES ARE. CLOWNS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. BECAUSE OF MIRACLES. AND HOLD NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR DEEDS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I DON'T LIKE IT. BUT THOSE ARE THE RULES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So whats this juju he gave you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.</span>
