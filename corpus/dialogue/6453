    <span style="color: #e00707">TT: Bro.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What are you doing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems you are zoning out again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What happened to all these actual responsibilities you were going to take seriously?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I was thinking about what to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Strategizing. Factoring contingencies. You know how it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems to me you were dwelling within your dream awareness at the expense of your waking business again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't think you're as awesome a multi-tasker as you like to think. You know you kind of zombie the fuck out on this side when you get all contemplative on that side.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Appearances are deceptive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm still in control here. Just doing this human thing we call &quot;chilling out for half a goddamn minute.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I say y'all are overestimating your mind's capability to run shit in parallel.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What do you think you are? A machine?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I already deployed a variety of mechanical avatars dedicated to that self-aggrandizing fantasy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You have the incredible privilege of getting to be one of them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's right. I am a machine, and therefore I can keep like billions of calculations or whatever all humming away at once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I tackle shit in background processes that you could only dream of wrapping your exquisite looking head around, even on a great hair day.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You know pi?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What, you mean the number?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes, the number. The big circle number, genius.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I knew you meant the fucking number, my question was a joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I know your question was a joke, my response was a joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, I know that. I'm practically you, dumbass. All these things we're saying are jokes, including this fuckin' useless clarification.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What about pi?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, the thing is, I solved it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What do you mean you solved it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I mean that's what a hotshot I am. I fuckin' solved it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like, calculated it so much, I got to the end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Bullshit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You wish it was bullshit. The last number is 4. Read it and fucking weep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not 4 you jackass, it's fucking nothing. There is no end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Said the smug organic matter with a lifespan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look, I know you're just fucking with me because for some reason I decided to program my own personal troll three years ago, but this shit was proven.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Actually demonstrated with unassailable mathematics, like a long ass time ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, I just assailed it. It wasn't even that hard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like I just kept hacking those digits so furiously with my sick 'rithms, the whole goddamn number just cried uncle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I kind of wore it out, and it just gave up. Sort of like I overloaded the system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You know like in the old movie when Ferris Bueller got the nuclear computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself so hard, it blew up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is laughable. It's a totally elementary thing. I'm pretty sure an ancient Greek guy settled shit about irrational numbers. It was practically when math was invented.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Sure, it was settled, and then some roboshades came along and owned that fucker posthumously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I also figured out all the prime numbers too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, not having this conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Did it while we were talking just now. Got to the end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And you know what? The last one isn't even that big. Kinda dissapointed, to be honest.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What is even a prime number?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are they the, like... really, really choice ones? The sweetest numbers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You lost me, supercomputer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is what I'm saying. I put your ability to keep plates spinnin' on sticks to insane amounts of shame.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't even sleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Neither do I.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I know that, that was the fucking joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Holy shit, turns out joking was the basis for my response too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Aren't these ironic &quot;you don't get the joke&quot; conversations we have always just so awesome? &lt;- A joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Ha ha, nice one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Anyway, all I'm saying is you can leave some of the heavy lifting to me now and then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll keep that in mind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the meantime, I have to contact Jane and warn her Roxy might try to pull that pointless stunt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So, thanks for snapping me out of my daydream so I could do that, I guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Looks like you're pulling your weight already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: See? Maybe that was my whole point in having this conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your point was to fuck with me, like it usually is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My point was to point out you've got multi-self management issues, dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Jugglin' too many selves for being not-software.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My point was also to fuck with you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Also,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My point was to ask,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Are you really going to go through with it today?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The Jake thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Will you just,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hold on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Let me deal with the Jane thing first.</span>
