EB: oh, hey!

EB: you're back.

TT: For now. I'll have to leave again shortly.

TT: It looks like there's another large meteor headed for...

TT: My present location.

EB: oh, so you mean dave connected with you?

TT: Not yet.

TT: I'll explain later.

TT: But I think I've determined that activating the timer in the game is not directly responsible for summoning a meteor to your location.

TT: The countdown seems merely to exist as a kind of warning to the player.

TT: As well as a strange coincidence.

EB: um, ok.

EB: i don't really think i get it.

EB: is this relevant?

TT: Probably not at the moment. And certainly not to you.

TT: I have to go.

EB: ok, later!

TT: P.S. Try not to waste too much of that grist while I'm gone.
