TG: i remember that now

TG: then i guess thats what happened

TG: i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead

TT: Are you sure?

TG: is that wrong

TT: Maybe you should try to answer the question. Why did you want to go?

TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better

TT: But it seems simple enough. A set of bearings to follow.

TT: See? The application pilots the moon. Change course when necessary. Anyone can do it, really.

TT: We talked about this. Debated, if you recall.

TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit

TG: will you just tell me whats going on

TT: I'm just seeing if you can remember. And if you're sticking to your story, about why you should be the one to go.

TG: well i am

TG: because i should

TG: or should have

TG: man what the fuck is going on

TG: am i dead or are you dead or what

TT: You're almost there, really. Just try to remember a little more.

TT: What happened after we decided you'd go?

TG: uh

TG: oh yeah

TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon

TG: so i could pilot it out there

TG: fly it into the sun
