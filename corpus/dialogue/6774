<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess it had to happen like that, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's no way the Condesce would allow us to be born within even a century of our genetic forebears. The thought of that was completely disgusting to her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But I really would have liked to be able to meet them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess some things would just be too awesome to ever stand a chance of happening.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk didnt you tell me at some point that you did find evidence the witch killed them?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are you sure? I SWEAR i remember you saying something about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How could I have said anything like that before today? This was obviously the first time I mentioned any of this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am just having the NUTTIEST deja vu thing going on now. I feel weird.</span>
