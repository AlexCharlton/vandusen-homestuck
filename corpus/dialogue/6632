    <span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: jade.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is absolutely the shittiest ghost buster i have ever seen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: no way!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it is so yes way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: hes adorable, what are you even talking about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: jade, i thought you were going to take this game seriously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is not a serious ghost buster. no ghost could possibly fear that thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it is not possible, ghosts are known to be cruel and mischievous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: they will not want to befriend your fox man, they will only want to cover him in slime and then fly away.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i really think you should consider redesigning him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: nope. im keeping him :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, well, if you want to turn our squad into a fucking joke, then that's your business.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: shut up or ill give him a pink jumpsuit!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: argh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but seriously, those head swap options are for such noobs, i feel it's only fair to warn you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i think i will manage to survive the embarrassment in front of a bunch of salamanders and crocodiles</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you get a pass, but only because you yourself are a furry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: thank you</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: um</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: because he is davesprite?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just call him dave.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: isn't that easier? i mean, he IS dave after all... right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: well yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but hes kinda different from dave</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: pshh, he is so not different.</span>
