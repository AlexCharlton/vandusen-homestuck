UU: finally getting a bit aggressive with yoUr qUeen there?

UU: UsUally yoU aren't nearly as patient with her.

UU: the little "gambit" i permitted yoU at the start has certainly inspired some Unconventional play.

UU: it's not going qUite as miserably for yoU as i expected!

UU: i am sorry to damn yoU with faint praise, bUt with a track record like yoUrs, i sUspect one takes what he can get. ^u^

UU: rook to h4.

UU: time to shake things Up. move her, or take my knight.

UU: yoU know yoU want to take her. jUst look at her there. what a cheeky intrUsion. slithered right into yoUr palace and made herself comfy. maybe she'll lay an egg once she's finished her feast. ^U^

UU: might as well take her oUt. yoU know when the action begins and pieces start to fall, that's when yoU make all yoUr most creative mistakes!

UU: anyhoo, far from over yoU say?

UU: no, i don't imagine this game will be taking Up mUch more of oUr time.
