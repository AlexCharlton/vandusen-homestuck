    <span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's quite warm here on Lohac.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think I've been patient enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: When will I receive further instruction?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I could have contacted you at any time?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Only now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I came away with the impression from our last conversation that our next would take place on your invitation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I was being polite by waiting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your inevitable impatience caused you to contact me again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Inevitability is my invitation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's pretty smug.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am right to be smug. I am omniscient, extremely powerful, and very charming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Two out of three isn't bad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Can you use your limitless intelligence to figure out which ones I mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That was clever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">If I plead ignorance to the fact that you are denying my charisma, it invalidates my claim of omniscience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But if I must adhere to my all knowing status, it forces me to validate the unfortunate reality that you are feigning the opinion that my demeamor is unpalatable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not that it matters, because I have all three qualities and you know it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Could we get to the point?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, I was about to say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">We should hurry this along. My visitor is beginning to set things on fire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You have a visitor?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Who?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Some guy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I was joking anyway. I am not in a hurry at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You tell jokes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Haa haa.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, your visitor isn't setting anything on fire then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Oh, he most definitely is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hee hee.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm really not getting this joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I was joking about being in a hurry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">From my perspective, this conversation is taking place in less than one second.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I type very quickly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hoo hoo.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought you didn't lie.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Aren't jokes essentially humorous lies?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: At least, those like the one you just attempted.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Jokes are only temporary lies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">If the falsehood is never exposed, there is no punchline. If the punchline is never delivered, the lie is sealed forever, regardless of initial humorous intent. Lies are not funny.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think if you're going to risk tarnishing your record of honesty, you should probably get better material.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">My joke was objectively funny. Who would know better than I?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So you're saying an inaccurate statement doesn't count as a lie, as long as you say &quot;just kidding&quot; later?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Basically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What if it's much later? Is it still &quot;just a joke?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No, that would be something closer to a prank.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I don't play pranks very often.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you allowed to lie about playing pranks? If I asked you if you were playing a prank on me, would you tell the truth?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am allowed to do whatever I want. I choose never to lie. I also choose to tell jokes now and then, and to play pranks quite sparingly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But I can say that I have never played a prank on you, and no statement I have made to you thus far, or will make in this conversation, will contain any trace of falsehood for the sake of setting up a joke or a prank, with the exception of the joke I just made, and another one I will make very soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm starting to change my mind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Oh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. I think your joke was funny in retrospect. Actually, your whole shtick is pretty good. I'm warming up to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes. I knew it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Just to be clear,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was the assurance you just made a prank or a joke?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It was neither. It was the truth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The truth?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Were you serious about wanting to die?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I'll tell you later.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because you asked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But why not now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because that piece of information would not fit elegantly into the sequence of our exchange at this moment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then you know how this entire conversation will go?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that true of all conversations you have?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes. Until, briefly, I don't. But the dark spots never last long. The truth disguises itself to me sometimes which can be mildly frustrating, but it usually reveals itself quickly, much as if a punchline was delivered. It's a humorous dialogue I have with reality, and it is very amusing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why do you bother with the conversations? Obligation to predestination, as usual?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">There is no obligation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It's a pleasure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I've always had a soft spot for young ladies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's a little creepy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No it's not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No it's not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It kind of is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I have looked into the future and determined that we would continue in this manner pointlessly for some time, so I am putting an end to it here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That doesn't make sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was that the other joke?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Heh. Good one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Thank you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How young are the ladies you typically take a shining to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And does this mean you are attracted to me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Suddenly this conversation is kind of terrible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Of course I am not. Not in the way you mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">And anyway, you are applying standards of conduct frowned upon for your kind which make no sense to apply to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am an immortal entity with a large cue ball for a head, and no biological means of reproduction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Also, if you were millions of years old, you would find that nearly every lady you encounter is quite young, relatively speaking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">There should be no reason for you to feel uncomfortable with this interaction. Try to think of me as one of your kindly human uncle figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">In fact, if I were in your presence now, I would offer you candy to prove it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh my god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Can we talk about the scratch instead of this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
