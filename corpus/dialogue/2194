TG: its called freemancipation. if its not pres-election its god-ascension

TG: in bruce almighty. whoops, different bruce from the one i just mentioned

EB: aaaaaarrrgh!

TG: cant explain to me why this aint condescension to think ill shit a brick

TG: not even he can convey the intention with his quickspun wit

TG: rather defray all this tension, sit on his lap while he whittles a splint

TG: and some guy eyes what he does and patronizes: i guess negrocity's the mother of invention

EB: stop rapping for a second you horse's ass!

EB: i have something important to talk about.

TG: whats up

EB: rose is in trouble and she needs help. i was going to connect to her with sburb but i lost my copy!

TG: ok

EB: also she lost battery power. if she can get back up and running, she'll need someone with the game to get her out of there before her house burns down.

EB: so i think you should use your copy of the game to help her!

TG: my copy?

TG: thats going to be tough

EB: why?

TG: i lost it

TG: its a stupid story and id rather not talk about it
