GT: I have never told anyone all that. Its so great to have a friend as good as you.

GG: That is what I am good for, it seems!

GT: If we hadnt cleared the air just now i probably never would have had the gumption to talk about it with you.

GT: Its so cool how you were honest with me about how you felt. I think honesty is always the best policy. I cant believe how much i was overcomplicating all this in my head.

GT: Haha the situation is really pretty funny when you think about it.

GG: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

GG: Yeaaaaaaaah..........
