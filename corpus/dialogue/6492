    <span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Say, Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not to cast doubt on your feelings, but are you quite sure all of Dirk's actions have been for the sake of courtship?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You did say his robot was prone to assailing you, did you not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is that really an affectionate gesture?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: He basically sent me that thing as kind of a sparring partner.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like to wrestle with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And i love to wrestle!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And yeah i guess he programmed it to be a bit overzealous but i mean what do you expect from the guy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think its his way of training me to become tougher.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Which sometimes is annoying and sometimes when i walk through the jungle im sweating bullets wondering if its going to pounce on me outta nowhere.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But theres actually something kind of exciting about that its like every day is more of an adventure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And truthfully its probably working i probably AM getting better at being in scrums.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess you're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And his responder which i guess is really a part of his personality even if he doesnt like to say so...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It kind of lets on a lot more than dirk ever would. Its almost like its this weird clone of himself playing passive aggressive matchmaker between me and his real self.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I can see how such a complicated relationship could keep you preoccupied.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I can't blame you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe you should just...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe you should just go for it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hell, why not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Just tell him you know how he feels and that you're open to the idea?</span>
