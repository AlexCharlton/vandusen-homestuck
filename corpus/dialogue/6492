GG: Not to cast doubt on your feelings, but are you quite sure all of Dirk's actions have been for the sake of courtship?

GT: Um...

GG: You did say his robot was prone to assailing you, did you not?

GG: Is that really an affectionate gesture?

GT: Well...

GT: He basically sent me that thing as kind of a sparring partner.

GT: Like to wrestle with.

GT: And i love to wrestle!

GG: Oh.

GT: And yeah i guess he programmed it to be a bit overzealous but i mean what do you expect from the guy.

GT: I think its his way of training me to become tougher.

GT: Which sometimes is annoying and sometimes when i walk through the jungle im sweating bullets wondering if its going to pounce on me outta nowhere.

GT: But theres actually something kind of exciting about that its like every day is more of an adventure.

GT: And truthfully its probably working i probably AM getting better at being in scrums.

GG: Yeah.

GG: I guess you're right.

GT: And his responder which i guess is really a part of his personality even if he doesnt like to say so...

GT: It kind of lets on a lot more than dirk ever would. Its almost like its this weird clone of himself playing passive aggressive matchmaker between me and his real self.

GG: Yeah.

GG: I can see how such a complicated relationship could keep you preoccupied.

GG: I guess I can't blame you.

GG: Maybe you should just...

GG: I don't know.

GT: What?

GG: Maybe you should just go for it.

GG: Hell, why not.

GG: Just tell him you know how he feels and that you're open to the idea?
