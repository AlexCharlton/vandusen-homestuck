AA: what g00d d0 y0u really think c0uld c0me 0f it

TT: Do you know about it?

TT: The sun?

AA: y0u cant p0ssibly wield its energy 0r put it t0 c0nstructive use

TT: That isn't exactly my plan.

AA: y0u w0nt find it either

AA: its imp0ssible

TT: How do you know that?

TT: Could you please share your information with me?

AA: n0!

AA: y0u still havent gathered that y0ure the pr0blem

AA: im thr0ugh with c0nsci0usly c0ntributing t0 inevitable 0utc0mes

TT: Well,

TT: Aren't you doing that regardless? Right now?

AA: 0bvi0usly

AA: but im just talking

AA: maybe the things i say will indirectly trigger y0ur critical acti0ns

AA: maybe n0t wh0 kn0ws

AA: maybe!!!

AA: maybe if i behave in a manner s0 rand0m

AA: parad0x space w0nt kn0w h0w t0 handle it!

AA: blah BL00P blee BLUH!@#$%^&*()_+

AA: didnt see that 0ne c0ming did y0u pspace??? + ?*rand(413^612)

AA: oh look and now i suddenly refuse to type zeroes in my sentences

AA: isnt that crazy! who thought that was even a possibility

AA: bslick never would have imagined THAT little vestibule of probability was tucked somewhere in his huge glistening blow sack

AA: ribbit ribbit ribbit

AA: WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT

AA: I JUST CONTROLLED THE RIBBITS AND I DID IT DELIBERATELY

TT: O_O

AA: hahaha!

AA: 0h w0w im sure y0u were just being faceti0us with that but y0u have n0 idea h0w funny that is right n0w

AA: y0u had n0 way 0f kn0wing thats a thing i d0 all the time but with zer0es

AA: this is great

AA: i think im 0n t0 s0mething here

AA: maybe if i dig deep en0ugh int0 my circuitry and rer0ute all 0f my reserve p0wer thr0ugh my quantum based rand0m number generat0r i can pr0duce behavi0r s0 c0mpletely 0ff the wall that parad0x space will have n0 ch0ice but t0 change everything!

TT: You have circuitry?

AA: maybe i will also rig my p0wer s0urce t0 the 0utc0me 0f the functi0n and rand0mly bl0w myself up!

AA: that w0uld be just

AA: really

AA: really

AA: really*rand(rand(rand(rand(rand(0M)*0M)*0M)*0M)*0M) where 0M = s0me number drawn quite at rand0m fr0m 0ne 0f y0ur absurd human hats

AA: !~M~0~D~N~A~R

AA: g00dbye r0se

AA: enj0y y0ur rampant indiscreti0ns

AA: talk t0 y0u later assuming i havent rand0mly bl0wn myself up!

TT: Wait, don't go!

TT: You were actually interesting.
