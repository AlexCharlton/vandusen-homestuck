GG: this will not do

GA: The Problem Isnt That The Frog Is Still Frozen

GA: The Problem Is That You Were Able To Appearify It At All

GA: Ectobiology Is Based Entirely On Your Inability To Appearify A Subject

GG: i dont understand!

GG: but i am intrigued...

GA: If That Frog Were Destined To Do Something Else

GA: Such As Become Ensnared In Your Net Later

GA: You Would Not Be Able To Appearify It Because That Would Cause A Paradox

GA: So Instead You Would Appearify Its Slime Imprint

GA: The Paradox Slime Is What Is Important Here

GA: You Can Mix It With The Slime From Other Paradoxically Appearified Frog Imprints

GA: Study The Genes And Selectively Combine

GA: And Then Create Resulting Paradox Clones

GG: ok, that makes sense i think

GG: how can i appearify some frog slime?

GA: You Will Need To Direct The Terminal To Another Frog

GA: And Then You Must Be Sure Later To Interfere With That Frog In Some Way

GA: For Instance By Planning To Venture Out To Capture That Exact Frog As I Suggested Earlier

GA: That Way It Will Be Impossible To Appearify The Frog Before Your Interference Has Taken Place

GA: Only Its Slime Will Arrive

GG: so it is like

GG: a sort of backwards frog breeding

GG: clone first, catch later?

GA: Yes
