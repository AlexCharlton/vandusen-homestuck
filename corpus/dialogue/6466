UU: actUally, i have written hUndreds of pages examining the striking differences between hUman and troll romance, as well as reprodUctive habits, as the comparison makes for a marveloUs case stUdy in xenobiocUltUral differences.

UU: as long as i am sharing specUlation with yoU, perhaps yoU woUld like to read my essays?

UU: i coUld even paste each page right here in sUccession, and allow yoU to read them back to back to back to back to back to back! ^u^

TT: Oh hell no.

UU: ah.

UU: yes, yoU're right of coUrse. i'm probably getting carried away as UsUal.

UU: forgive my enthUsiasm, it's jUst that i so rarely have anyone to talk to who shares my passion for these matters.

UU: certainly not my cUrmUdgeonly coplayer. >:U

TT: I mean, not that all that stuff wouldn't be fascinating to pore through, on some level.

TT: But we kind of have things to do here.

TT: Remember you were gonna take a nap?

UU: by jove, the nap!!!

UU: yes, i really mUst secUre a bit of shUteye.

TT: By jove?

TT: Oh my lord.

UU: yoUr lord?

UU: what...

UU: do yoU mean by that exactly? :u

TT: Nothin'.

TT: Hang on, though. Before you go,

TT: You never did give me any actual advice on my situation.

TT: With the dead agent, and my blown cover.

UU: oh, right!

UU: i woUld look at it this way.

UU: yoU are moments away from beginning yoUr session, yes?

TT: Sure.

UU: and yoU have already spent a long time gathering intelligence Unbeknownst to the aUthorities.

UU: how mUch more do yoU expect to accUmUlate even if yoU coUld stay Undetected?

UU: and how mUch strategic advantage is left to gain by delaying yoUr discovery for mUch longer?

TT: I don't know.

UU: i say the time to make a stand is now!

UU: to hell with the dersite tossers.

UU: make yoUr presence known. let them see that the prince is awake, and make it abUndantly clear what that means.

UU: perhaps it is their tUrn to be nervoUs? to cower in the shadows and live in Uncertainty?

TT: Hmm.

UU: that is my advice. do with it as yoU will.

UU: now i'm off to get some rest. u_u

UU: with any lUck, the next time we convene, both of oUr adventUres will be well Under way.

UU: cheerio!

TT: You know, I'm not sure anyone ever actually says cheerio.

TT: Unless they're pretending to be British.

TT: Oh whatever.
