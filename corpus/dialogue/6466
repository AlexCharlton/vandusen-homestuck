    <span style="color: #929292">UU: i think their romantic practices are particUlarly esoteric.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: actUally, i have written hUndreds of pages examining the striking differences between hUman and troll romance, as well as reprodUctive habits, as the comparison makes for a marveloUs case stUdy in xenobiocUltUral differences.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as long as i am sharing specUlation with yoU, perhaps yoU woUld like to read my essays?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I mean, not that all that stuff wouldn't be fascinating to pore through, on some level.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Remember you were gonna take a nap?</span>
