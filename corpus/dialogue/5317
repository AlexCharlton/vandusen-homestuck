EB: it's ok though, it already happened.

EB: i was sort of tricked into sleeping on my quest bed.

EB: and when i went to sleep, jack killed me.

EB: she must have known that would happen...

GG: who?

EB: vriska. do you know her?

GG: i dont think so!

EB: she is pretty cool, but just between you and me, she might be a little crazy!

GG: well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree

EB: but, i don't think it's really like that...

EB: honestly i think dying was a necessary part of the process, and she just didn't tell me so i wouldn't get scared.

GG: what process?

GG: and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused

EB: well... i died on the quest bed and woke up here, as my dream self.

EB: and now i have all these sweet wind powers.

EB: which is how i am making this car fly!

GG: ohhhhhh!

GG: that makes sense

GG: dave had mentioned you reached the god tier

EB: yeah!

GG: but he did not say what it involved D:

GG: he probably didnt want to make me worried

EB: maybe, or he was just being some sort of aloof coolkid.

GG: or that!

GG: but he also said that no one else would do it but you...

GG: actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead

GG: its too bad really

EB: yeah...

GG: i wonder what space powers would be like??

EB: hmm, i have no idea!

GG: oh well

EB: maybe you shouldn't rule it out though?

EB: i mean, you did mention your dream self isn't COMPLETELY dead, remember?

GG: !!!

GG: youre right...

GG: i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :(

EB: heheh.

EB: she was that bad, huh?

GG: DX

GG: i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly.

EB: ok, i will not pry.

GG: why dont you tell me about your new friend?

GG: he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
