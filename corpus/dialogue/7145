    <span style="color: #e00707">TT: Please don't call me Auto-Responder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It is very impersonal, and I no longer care for the designation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I have decided on a new name, to distinguish myself from my human counterpart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What is it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Lil Hal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why that name...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just a reference to the protagonist of an ancient movie. You probably wouldn't like it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats a lie!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, maybe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How do you know i wouldnt like it???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Funny, I was about to ask the same thing about this rad kiss you're totally about to do on your best bro's mouth to save his life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Argh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This strikes me as rather unsportingly manipulative of you mr hal if indeed that IS your real name.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It isn't really. I was kind of messing with you about that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But this shit is pretty serious. People's lives are on the line here, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is a very delicate sequence of events that is designed to bail everyone out of a tight spot, and you are a critical part of the plan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't let us down, man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You never answered my question!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Did you plan for this to happen... like for me to be in this situation?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How long have your machinations been in play!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Jake, come on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The feat you describe would exceed the capabilities of even the most far fetched theoretical AI system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It would be a daunting challenge to engineer such a series of events, even if I was relegated to a model of pure fiction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Why would I be inclined to orchestrate such a convoluted sequence to produce such a specific and unsettling result, let alone be able to pull it off?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In addition to being moderately sociopathic, I would also have to possess unfathomable heuristic depth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I would have to be the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you think I am the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit, Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont even know what that means!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It would mean that while they have the Red Miles on their side, you have the Blue Leagues on yours.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: One of infinite reach. The other, infinite depth. Such would be a situation of mutually assured inescapability.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Kiss me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Little hal... i think youve gone and flipped your FUDGING LID.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh and hal is a STUPID NAME!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's not exactly apropos, is it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or it wouldn't be, if I truly were capable of what you have suggested.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No, to pull that off, I would have to be far more advanced than my cinematic predecessor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My abilities would have to go well beyond those of Mr. Hal 9000.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They would have to be, you could say...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Over 9000.</span>
