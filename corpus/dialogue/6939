GG: Roxy, where are you??? :(

TT: We'll track her down.

TT: The important thing to do now is deploy all the devices quickly, so the house will be ready to jet the moment she gets back.

GG: How do you know she's not hurt?

TT: That is statistically remote.

TT: Given that I can track the coordinates of certain devices she carries, and they are presently in motion.

TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat, or even the drones.

GG: Then what is?

TT: Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?

GG: Oh...

GG: Yes.

GG: What IS that??
