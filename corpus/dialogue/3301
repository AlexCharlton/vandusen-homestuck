TT: Where did she get the discs?

TG: i dont know how does she do any of the loopy batshit nonsense she does

TG: maybe she pulled them out of the volcano over there on bloodmonkey mountain

TT: Wait.

TT: So you mean to tell me she was able to connect with you in a timely fashion, without waiting until you were on the brink of annihilation?

TG: we went over this

TG: i was a little bogged down

TG: in the epic swaddle of legendary puppet taint

TT: I've done nothing but wait for boys to play this game with me all day.

TT: First John lollygagging with the client, and then you with the server, downright filibustering my existence with unending fraternal melee.

TT: And yet a girl, one who didn't even own the game, was able to connect with you minutes after you connected with me.

TG: whoa wait

TG: what the hell is she doing

TG: shes taking my bed what the hell

TT: And there she goes.

TT: She HAS the karma.
