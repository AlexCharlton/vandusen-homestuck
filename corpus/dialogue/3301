<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know how does she do any of the loopy batshit nonsense she does</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe she pulled them out of the volcano over there on bloodmonkey mountain</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Wait.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So you mean to tell me she was able to connect with you in a timely fashion, without waiting until you were on the brink of annihilation?</span>
