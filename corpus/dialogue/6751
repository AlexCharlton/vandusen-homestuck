GT: Wait the whatsits?

TT: Right. Another thing I forgot to mention.

TT: There are a lot of these humanoid creatures with hard shells. Some black, some white.

TT: As humanity was dwindling due to an increasingly whimsical and psychopathic Condesce, she began introducing more of these Carapacians on to the scene.

GT: Are they aliens too?

TT: Uh...

TT: Sort of. They are definitely from other planets, so, yeah. Really the deal with where they came from is a whole other story for another time.

TT: But the bottom line is at some point, somehow, she started herding a bunch of them from their home worlds on to Earth and multiplying them.

TT: Something like a hundred years ago it became clear she favored these guys more than humans as her subjects.

TT: They're very loyal and seem genuinely dedicated to serving her. Must be what they were bred for. She still treats them like shit though, unsurprisingly.

TT: All these colonies started sprouting up. Like these modular cities floating on the water.

TT: It probably sounds cooler than it is. But they're basically slums. That's where they tend to live in large numbers.

TT: Roxy lives in one of these colonies. It's about 2000 miles from where I am.
