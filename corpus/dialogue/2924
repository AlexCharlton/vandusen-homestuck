EB: oh god.

EB: see?? this is therapy bullshit!

TT: That was a joke.

TT: But anyway, whether it means you are crazy or not, consider this theory:

TT: Your presumably longstanding tendency for scrawling this imagery is really your subconsious trying to express something disturbing within you.

TT: Possibly something from your past, which you have blocked out.

TT: And since you have supressed it, your conscious self cannot acknowledge the drawings, therefore they have been invisible until now.

EB: why now?

TT: Perhaps because you have seen evidence that conflicts with the worldview your subconscious has constructed to obfuscate the truth.

TT: That your dad is not necessarily the clown-loving maniac you thought he was.

TT: All along, this negative attribute buried in your psyche may have been projected on to him, and subsequently reviled, as a sort of defense mechanism.

EB: but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.

EB: he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE.

TT: Is it unthinkable that over the years it was he who believed you were the one with a passion for clowns? Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?

TT: A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.

TT: Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.

TT: Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.

EB: i dunno.

EB: not sure about all this.

EB: but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.

TT: It's awesome.

EB: yeah.
