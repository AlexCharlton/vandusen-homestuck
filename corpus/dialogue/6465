TT: Would you ever be inclined to share?

UU: ohhhh, no no no no no no no.

UU: i woUld be far too embarrassed to do that.

TT: That's cool. I'm not trying to pass judgment here. Just curious.

TT: Do any of these stories about us by any chance involve...

TT: Romance?

UU: well...

UU: maybe jUst...

UU: Um.

UU: a wee bit. :u

TT: How wee?

UU: a smidgen or two.

TT: Which is it? One smidgen, or two smidgens?

UU: OK A WHOLE BLOODY LOT OF SMIDGENS. XU

UU: i'm sorry. unu

TT: Ok, I am seriously curious to read some.

TT: I won't show anyone, I promise.

UU: bUUUt...

UU: yoU woUldn't even Understand it!

UU: my species has a completely different Understanding of romance than yoU do.

UU: it woUld probably offend yoU deeply. it might even sicken yoU!

TT: But that only makes me want to check it out more.

TT: Really, there's no way it's going to sicken or offend me. Whatever it is, I've seen worse.

TT: I'm not judging you at all here. I'm genuinely curious about your work.

UU: no, i'm sorry love, i jUst CANNOT abide.

UU: if i let anyone read it, i woUld cUrl Up and die of shame. U_U

TT: K, no biggie.

TT: Is there any kind of work you will share with me?

UU: hmm.

UU: well, when i find myself immersed in specUlation...

UU: i do often enjoy drawing the things i imagine.

TT: Oh, really?

UU: yes. ^u^

TT: Any you'd be willing to spare a peek at?

UU: well...

UU: yes!

UU: yoU've talked me into it. this sUddenly soUnds fUn, and i have jUst the thing to show yoU.

TT: Awesome.

UU: yoU were asking aboUt whether yoU woUld ascend to godhood.

UU: and withoUt getting into whether yoU do or do not, i have specUlated on yoUr hypothetical appearance, since that oUtcome is jUst as cloaked to me as it is to yoU.

UU: given what is docUmented for the typical accoUtrements and cUt of the prince garb, and palette for the heart aspect, i think this is likely spot on!

UU: http://tinyurl.com/dirkisthisyoU

TT: Holy shit.

TT: Do I actually have to wear that?

UU: perhaps. it all depends Upon how mUch of yoUr inner greatness yoU wish to realize. u_u

TT: Ok, what is with the butterfly wings?

UU: we sproUt them Upon ascension! aren't they beaUtifUl?

TT: Uh.

UU: i have seen many depictions of sUch heroes with wings, Unless they happen to be hiding them beneath their clothes.

UU: i gUess i can't be absolUtely sUre, bUt i believe it's reasonably likely the Upgrade is Universal!

TT: I should sure as god damn Christ hope the fuck not.

TT: What about this knickerbocker bullshit?

TT: Is that legit?

UU: yUp!

UU: one hUndred percent princely canon.

TT: God dammit.

TT: I guess those asskicking gloves are pretty cool.

TT: I dunno. I can probably make it work.

TT: How much of this shit is compulsory by game law or whatever?

TT: Am I obligated to traipse around in fucking tights and puffy little asshole pants forever?

UU: no, silly.

UU: they are jUst clothes. yoU are free to swap parts if yoU like.

UU: or, if yoU wish to be free of it altogether, change back into yoUr plain clothes, and bob's yoUr Uncle. like it never even happened!

TT: Ok.

TT: Well, don't get me wrong, I think the drawing is great. I'm only taken aback on some finer points of fashion.

UU: ^u^!!!

TT: Also,

TT: Bob's my uncle?

UU: oh...

UU: no, love! it was a figUre of speech.

TT: Yeah, I know that.

UU: ah.

UU: did i Use it incorrectly?

TT: I don't think so.

TT: I mean, I guess not?

UU: say, what is an Uncle, by the by?

TT: It's sort of like this weird, superfluous dad.

UU: hmm.

TT: Like a strange man in your life that barely has anything to do with you, but is just there for some reason.

TT: They're practically always douche bags.

UU: i sUppose i'll jUst have to take yoUr word for it. :u

TT: Ok, but just one question.

TT: Not to do with the future or anything, just about you.

UU: yes?

TT: Are you British?

TT: Or pretending to be British, in a sort of ironic or stylized way?

UU: doing what now?

TT: I mean, I guess it doesn't make sense for an alien to be British.

TT: Or for an alien to be American, for that matter.

UU: hmm...

UU: no, i fancy neither of those things make mUch sense at all.

TT: Just the way you type is making it seem that way is all.

UU: oh!

UU: yes, that woUld be my qUirk.

TT: Quirk?

TT: So like,

TT: Deliberate affectation?

UU: no! a qUirk!!!

UU: qUirk dirk.

UU: heeheehee. ^u^

TT: You pretending to be British is a quirk.

TT: What the fuck is a quirk?

UU: we all need a qUirk!

UU: it adds spice to oUr voices and helps Us stand oUt as individUals.

TT: That's stupid.

TT: I don't have a fucking quirk, and I don't want one.

UU: oh, well of coUrse YOU woUldn't.

UU: yoU're hUman.

UU: hUmans are notorioUsly strange. :U
