CT: D --> What you do appear to know is e%actly how to ma%imize my livid contempt for you

CT: D --> With your revolting language and your sense of decorum

CT: D --> At such breathtaking odds with the richness and perfe%ion of your b100d

CT: D --> I just hate you so much

CT: D --> And the degrees to which you pollute your precious b100d

CT: D --> With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins

CT: D --> Maddening

CT: D --> You will stop

TC: WhOaAaA, i WiLl?

TC: hOw Do YoU kNoW tHaT?

CT: D --> This is una%eptable

CT: D --> Ok, let's start over

CT: D --> I apologize

CT: D --> I was completely out of of line, and I'm sorry

CT: D --> I have no right to talk to you like that, or tell you what you can't do

TC: aWw, No WoRrIeS!

CT: D --> It's not my place

CT: D --> Your habits notwithstanding, I am lesser than you

CT: D --> An inferior

TC: hAhAhA. oK.

CT: D --> Don't you understand that you're better than me

CT: D --> Can you please act like it

CT: D --> That's not a command, it's just a polite request I guess

TC: oK, i CaN tRy, BuT mAn I dOn'T kNoW iF i KnOw HoW tO bE lIkE a BeTtEr MoThErFuCkEr ThAn AnY oThEr MoThErFuCkEr.

CT: D --> 100k, it isn't that difficult

CT: D --> Try to be cognizant of your desires and needs

CT: D --> And attempt to regard those around you as simple vehicles meant to bring about your gratification

TC: WoW, wHaT?

CT: D --> What are you doing

TC: uHhHhHh.

CT: D --> Right now

CT: D --> It sounds as if you have begun playing with the red team

CT: D --> Is this true

TC: :o)

CT: D --> Good

CT: D --> This is very good

CT: D --> It really pleases me to hear tales of physical subjugation

CT: D --> I presume these were lesser beings, toiling in the lower ranks of some hierarchy

TC: wElL yEaH, tHeY'rE uNdErLiNgS.

CT: D --> Ok

CT: D --> It pleases me considerably less to hear things like that

CT: D --> But I've already stated I have no right to be disappointed by your conduct, so I will try to control myself

CT: D --> If it would help to couch it in those terms

CT: D --> Then yeah, I guess so

CT: D --> I've made a bit of a mess and anyone in a position of authority would surely be % about it

TC: Uh.

TC: %?

CT: D --> Cross

TC: oHhH.

CT: D --> What do you make of it

CT: D --> But I comprehend the sentiment

CT: D --> I have lots of thoughts, but they're difficult to communicate

CT: D --> If you'll listen

CT: D --> See, that's what I mean

CT: D --> How is it possible for one of your distin%ion to be so ignorant

CT: D --> And loathesome

CT: D --> Whereas

CT: D --> A member of the most abject, verminous b100dline of all

CT: D --> Can conduct herself with such grace and possess nothing but admirable mannerisms

CT: D --> I find these striking ju%tapositions perple%ing, and I confess strangely into%icating

CT: D --> I wonder if I have gone mad

CT: D --> To form such a pact with her

TC: WoW, i GoT nO fUcKiN cLuE wHaT yOu'Re TaLkInG aBoUt
