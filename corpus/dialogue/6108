GG: J, how goes the bunnyquest?

GT: Ive barely even begun!

GG: Tell me about it.

GT: Youre off to a sluggish start then too i gather?

GG: Dad has the whole house in full fatherly lockdown mode. Talk about blowing a few measly "assassination attempts" way out of proportion!

GG: So I'm currently mulling over my next move.

GG: What is it that has you hamstrung? Did you ever track down the slippery Mr. Strider?

GT: Not exactly.

GT: His stupid doppelglasses have set me on a wild goose chase to go pry his dumb robots chest open and swipe its uranium.

GG: Sounds dangerous!

GT: No shit.

GT: I think id rather deal with the monsters.

GG: Why is it that our two best friends in the world always seem to place themselves at the source of all our problems, while simultaneously presenting their only solutions?

GT: I know right???

GG: I'm debating whether or not to enlist his help in the matter of my current imprisonment. But I'd rather keep it as a plan of last resort.

GT: Dont do it jane its a trap!!!

GG: We'll see.

GG: So I take it you're out and about now?

GT: Hell no. I spent so much time haggling with those confounded shades im only leaving my room just now.

GG: Right. Well, not to keep you too long, since we both still have our missions ahead of us, but I wanted to tell you about that dream I had.

GT: Oh yeah!

GT: I was curious about that. Tell me everything and make it snappy!

GT: *Whips up bucket of freshly popped corn.*

GG: Hoo. :B

GG: Ok, but, I should say that the nature of the dream was a bit worrisome.

GG: And I'm concerned it may have implications for the game we're about to play.

GG: So it's probably best that I tell you about it before you leave.

GT: Well shoot.

GT: Ok then lay it on me jane.
