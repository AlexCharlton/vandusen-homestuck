GA: Are These Tactics Really Necessary

TT: It's faster this way.

TT: If there's one thing you and your friends regularly remind us, it's that time is not on our side.

GA: I Know

GA: But I Thought Our Methods Earlier Were Effective

GA: In Illuminating The Underpinnings Of The Game

GA: You Ask Some Questions

GA: And I Answer

GA: If I Can

TT: Yes, that has been effective.

TT: But you don't know everything, do you?

GA: No

TT: My current strategy is comprehensive.

TT: Your notes have been helpful, but the facts you've supplied are being cross-referenced with understandings I already have, and data gathered by the sort of means presently on display.

TT: I still have more questions for you, which I will ask in time.

GA: Okay

GA: But These Means Presently On Display

GA: Are Making Me A Little Nervous

GA: I Think Its Kind Of A Reckless Use Of

TT: Of what?

GA: These Forces

TT: Dark magic, you mean?

GA: Yes

GA: Well

GA: Influence By The Gods From The Furthest Ring

GA: The Communion You Seem To Have Developed With Them I Find Kind Of Troubling

TT: I don't think they are as nefarious as you might imagine.

TT: Many of them seem to be intent on helping us.

GA: How Exactly Do You Know That

TT: From their whispers in my dreams.

GA: How Much Time Have You Really Spent Sleeping

GA: Since You Began Playing

TT: Not much.

TT: But quite a lot in a failed timeline.

TT: And now and then, memories surface from that alternate reality.

TT: Vague memories, but unmistakable in familiarity, like spontaneously remembering a dream from years ago by some inexplicable catalyst.

TT: In that reality, they spoke to me in my sleep and told me much of what I needed to know.

TT: Including what to do to reset our timeline and create the present reality.

GA: That Makes Me No Less Nervous

GA: Our Understanding Is That Influence From Doomed Timelines

GA: Though Seemingly Necessary To Advance In The Alpha Reality

GA: Is Generally Inauspicious

GA: Travelers From Such Branches Are Marked For Death

GA: And Though It Was Only An Insubstantial Part Of You Which Traveled

GA: Just Memories I Suppose

GA: Its Still Troubling

TT: I have assurances I'm on the right track.

TT: Surely you must have spoken to the gods by now.

TT: What did they tell you to make you so suspicious?

GA: Actually

GA: I Havent

GA: I Have Never Visited Derse Or Traveled Beyond The Veil

GA: Prospits Moon Was My Home

GA: For Most Of My Dreaming Life

TT: It was?

GA: Yes

TT: This surprises me.

GA: Why

TT: ...

TT: Good question.

GA: Skaia Was Always The Foil For My Curiosity

GA: But It Only Showed Me What I Needed To See

GA: It Very Much Had The Presence Of Something Sentient

GA: And

GA: Benevolent

GA: But Silent

GA: Not Something To Converse With Or Be Instructed By

GA: Or Anything With An Agenda Beyond Which It Knows To Be Manifest Already

GA: Like A Very Clear Mirror

GA: That Has Everything There Is To See Inside It

GA: But Only Some Things Are Visible At Any Given Moment

GA: I Always Trusted It

GA: And I Dont Trust Gods That Would Eschew Its Light

TT: You didn't actually answer my question.

TT: When was it exactly that you read my walkthrough?
