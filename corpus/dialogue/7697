    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Best birthday ever?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or best FUCKING birthday ever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: In the interest of appeasing the irony gods, let's go with the latter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Whatever role I played in ruining your party.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sorry about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh lord. The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid &quot;sweet sixteen&quot;.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Haha. Thanks, Calliope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I still think I've been pretty lousy to you. I had my head up my ass for a while there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: By the time your birthday came around, I was kinda freaking out about Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought I had the situation under control. But I didn't. Not just with Jake, but with respect to pretty much everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Boy, you really let him have it back there!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Heh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: At least, it did at the time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I only wish I could have stayed as lucid as you during our...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Transformation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How did you manage that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It wasn't on purpose. Actually if I had a choice, I probably would have just said, fuck it. Sugar shock my brain, please.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Suffice to say, I have trouble escaping from myself. It's kind of a problem. Let's not talk about it though. Please continue.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Okay.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So instead of keeping my cool like you, I just started gushing over him like a lovestruck loon, surrendering any sliver of dignity I might have earned by telling him off earlier.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just cannot believe some of the things I said. Oh God. I told him I wanted to get married and have babies!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah but to be fair, by the time you came looking for me, all three of you were saying that to anything that moved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I know! But...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's one thing to write off something you say to an altered state of mind. But what makes the admission so mortifying to me is...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I actually MEANT it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I'm sure he must know that by now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And now I feel so humiliated I just want to die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I would ask him to shoot me right here, if I could bring myself to say a word to him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Somehow I don't think he's up to the task.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is doubly unfortunate, since that's literally what we all came here to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Speaking personally, I'd probably run this sword through my own dick before I could bring myself to kill Roxy. Even for her own good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When the chips are down, I guess that's how much of a badass I really am.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Woo!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We are all such WINNERS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, our moxie's off the fuckin' charts.</span>
