GG: But I cannot lie, sir.

GG: Nothing you have said has made me one iota less excited to begin this adventure!

GG: Those dastardly agents can try to assassinate me all they like. I just want to get started!

TT: That's the most awesome way to be, Jane.

TT: And it is again why you will be our leader.

TT: (Sort of.)

GG: Right.

GG: Still fixing to pull the strings for us, per your extensive puppet metaphor?

TT: Pulling them as we speak.

TT: I am having Lil Seb install a real copy of the client on another computer in your house.

TT: A clean computer, not any of this BCCorp garbage you tend to accumulate.

TT: I'll have to insist from this point onward, you employ neutral devices.

TT: That shit fucks with your head.

GG: Hrm.

GG: Alrighty, I think I can make that concession.

TT: Once it's installed, I'll connect with you. I will be your server player.

TT: I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but some improvisation is in order.

TT: While you get the ball rolling, I'll try to talk some sense into that mercurial boozehound.

GG: Sounds like a plan.

GG: I do hope she comes around. It would be a bummer to play without her.

TT: She will.

GG: Say, do I even have any machines that survived the explosion besides this one?

TT: Do you even have any machines that don't inundate you with fucking Hamburger Helper ads and Guy Fieri's heinous propaganda?

GG: I guess not. :p

GG: Still, some nice things were surely destroyed.

GG: I think Detective Pony was caught in the blast.

GG: It's unlikely Acorn survived. :'(

TT: A fitting end to a life of moral compromise.

GG: So, since I'm apparently out of "neutral devices,"

GG: Which computer is Seb installing the file on?

TT: On your dad's computer downstairs.

TT: One in the study.
