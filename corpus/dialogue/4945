GA: Since The Gap Between Your Present Moment And The Implementation Of Your Mystifying Self Destruction Continues To Narrow

GA: This Will Be The Last Conversation In Which I Attempt To Talk You Out Of It Nicely

TT: I explained this.

TT: The intent isn't true self sacrifice.

GA: First Of All Youre Underestimating The Gravity Of A Dream Death

GA: Its A Pretty Serious Thing Okay

GA: And Dream Selves Are Important To A Person In Ways That Arent Always Obvious

GA: I Think Youre Being Frivolous But Thats Not Really The Sentiment Reinforcing The Exoskeleton Of My Argument

GA: Soon You Will Be Blacked Out Of Trollians Viewport

GA: And I Have No Explanation For This

GA: And Neither Do You

GA: So Ill Just Assume The Worst And You Should Too

TT: Are you sure it's not because I'm sleeping?

GA: Ive Seen You Sleep Before

GA: You Are Just

GA: Asleep

GA: On Screen

GA: Peaceful And Harmless And Posing No Threat To Anyone

TT: Shh...

GA: Uh

GA: Right Sorry

GA: Im Saying This Is A Special Case

TT: But I'm confident in my plan. I have it under control.

GA: Your Hubris Is Really Astonishing

GA: Easily Twice The Mass Of A Universe I Think

GA: That It Hasnt Collapsed Upon Itself Into A Tiny Lavender Singularity Is The Most Striking Marvel Paradox Space Has Coughed Up Yet

TT: Maybe it did?

TT: Maybe that's what went wrong.

TT: We figured it out!

GA: No Please Stop

GA: Humor Wont Deflect My Really Big And Important Tirade Okay

GA: You Are Investing Too Much Confidence In Evil Gods Who Oppose Skaia And Your True Purpose And

GA: I Cant Abide That

GA: And

GA: As Difficult As This Is For Me To Confess

GA: I Think Your Plan Is Very Dangerous

GA: And So Are You

TT: Oh?

GA: Yes

GA: And

GA: Im Afraid I Am Going To Have To Devote All My Efforts To Stopping You

TT: I'm sorry to hear that, Kanaya.
