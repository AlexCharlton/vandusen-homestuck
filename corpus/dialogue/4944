<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Sure.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Each of us seems to have a troll infatuated with helping us. Haven't you noticed?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: when did that happen</span>
