UU: it is the qUeen's favoUred attack. very long distance and omnidirectional.

UU: bUt once Upon a time, her weapon was stolen by a UsUrper. jacked, yoU coUld say, right off her ring finger. and then given a considerable boost in power.

UU: that gave the miles enoUgh of a kick to rip a Universe to shreds.

UU: and they have been doing so to yoUrs and its many instances for eons.

UU: only now have they caUght Up to yoUr instance. it is qUite fortUnate it has taken so long, really.

UU: some instances are tUcked deeper in the speaker's mighty blow sack, and will hold oUt for mUch longer, on a vast cosmic scale of coUrse.

TG: wait

TG: i dont

TG: what? instances

TG: blowb sack

TG: righ now i can hardly walk w/o steppin on my moms scarf ok

TG: so theyre destorying the universe is that the bootom line

UU: yes.

UU: try to think of it like this.

UU: imagine that the Universe is contained inside a very large creatUre.

UU: say, a great big frog.

TG: frog

TG: why a frog thats so silly

UU: it's jUst a frog! that is the way it is, jUst try to imagine it.

TG: k

TG: picturin

TG: big ol space frog

TG: all ribbiting loud an being huge

TG: hehehe

UU: now imagine that not only does the Universe exist inside it, depending on the creatUre's health and well being to sUrvive...

UU: bUt every potential instance of that Universe exists inside as well.

UU: those that are doomed and those with promise.

UU: even those that were reset from scratch, with slightly different starting conditions.

UU: all of those interrelated Universes mingling together inside yoUr frog, inextricable from its physiology.

UU: if the frog dies, they all go with it. eventUally.

TG: then you are saying some rude a-hole is killin our frog

UU: sadly, yes.

TG: wow

TG: that is

TG: just....

TG: the WORST

UU: well, it coUld have been worse, actUally. the miles coUld have spread to yoUr Universe before it had the chance to sproUt yoUr lovely planet, providing a home for yoU and yoUr wonderfUl mates.

UU: all Universes die at some point. some sooner than others. it is all part of the cycle, and sometimes things like this mUst happen for reasons beyond oUr Understanding.

UU: bUt this is neither here nor there. i did not intend to go blathering aboUt all that and waste an important conversation with yoU.

UU: i think the trUth is i am probably jUst stalling.

TG: stalling what

UU: i have some important things to tell yoU.

UU: i'm afraid i am going to be breaking so many rUles in doing so.

UU: i am not Used to breaking rUles. it makes me very Uncomfortable.

UU: bUt it may be my only chance. i hope yoU won't think less of me for it.

TG: no way

TG: i dont even know what rules ur talking about

TG: time shit rules

TG: if its time shit rules idgaf about those

TG: and m not goinna stop thinking youre great if u "break" them

TG: are you in trouble?

UU: yes.

UU: bUt so are yoU, and i've distracted yoU enoUgh.

UU: concentrate on retUrning to yoUr home.

UU: once yoU are there and preparing for the game, i will contact yoU again and tell yoU everything that i have been wanting to tell yoU.

UU: also...

UU: i wanted to give yoU something. :u

TG: hoh man

TG: what is it!

UU: jUst a thing!

UU: yoU'll see.

UU: now rUn along!!!!!!!!!!!
