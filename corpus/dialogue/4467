<span style="color: #626262">FUTURE carcinoGeneticist [FCG]</span> 599 HOURS FROM NOW opened memo on board TEAM ADORABLOODTHIRSTY.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: FINE THEN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SINCE PAST ME JUST BANNED CURRENT ME FROM THE PRECEDING MEMO</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND DOESN'T APPEAR TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY FUTURE WISDOM, AS USUAL</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LOOKS LIKE I'LL JUST HAVE TO START ANOTHER MEMO FROM SCRATCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HEY PAST ME, GO HAVE A BLAST KILLING THE KING, I'M SURE IT WILL BE AWESOME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IN FACT, IT WAS AWESOME. BANG UP JOB WITH THAT, DUDE!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: TOO BAD IT WAS ALL A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OH, WHAT'S THAT, PASTHOLE? YOU DIDN'T READ THIS AND FIGURE THAT OUT AHEAD OF TIME?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OR MAYBE YOU JUST SKIMMED THIS AND IT DIDN'T GET THROUGH YOUR THICK BULGE???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHAT A SHOCK!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: MEMO-WITHIN-MEMO TO PRESENT SELF: PUT FORTH A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT TO IMPRESS UPON EVERYONE IN THE PAST, MYSELF INCLUDED, WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS THEY ALL ARE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I AM LEARNING A VALUABLE LESSON TODAY!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T ALTER THE OUTCOME OF DECISIONS MADE BY MORONS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU YELL AT THEM.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS GIVE THEM A HARD TIME AND TRY TO MAKE THEIR LIVES JUST A LITTLE MORE MISERABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MORE NOBLE PURSUIT THAN CHANGING DESTINY FOR THE BETTER ANYWAY, FRANKLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LOSERS SHOULD BE FORCED TO FACE THE MUSIC, EVEN FOR THE MISTAKES THEY HAVEN'T MADE YET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEIR PUNISHMENT IS BEING ALLOWED TO MAKE THE MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. TALK ABOUT POETIC JUSTICE!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND THEN GETTING SOUNDLY BERATED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE MISTAKES ARE BEING MADE IS JUST THE MUCUS ON THE GRUBLOAF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THE SWEET, TANGY MUCUS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS IS DUMB.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHY DID I EVER THINK THESE MEMOS WERE GOING TO BE A GOOD IDEA.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NOBODY CARES</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I MEAN</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NOBODY'S EVEN TROLLING ME ANYMORE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND I'M LEAVING MYSELF WIDE OPEN TOO, SAYING SOME PRETTY DUMB THINGS HERE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I GUESS MAYBE I WROTE TOO MANY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND FILLED TOO MANY OF THEM WITH LONG ARGUMENTS WITH MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NO ONE'S GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL THIS, ALL THE VALUABLE INFORMATION IS JUST GETTING LOST IN THE YELLING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU STUPID STUPID IDIOT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OH FUCK YOU, WHY'D YOU EVEN START ANOTHER MEMO THEN??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I GUESS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO GET OFF MY CHEST, OK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OH GOD, NOW I'M ARGUING WITH CURRENT ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE I WAS DOING IT, THIS IS REALLY FUCKED UP.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I'VE GOT TO PULL IT TOGETHER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THINK BACK TO WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE WRONG.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT THE THING IS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AS MUCH AS OUR PAST SELVES ARE A BUNCH OF STUBBORN UNLISTENING ASSHOLES</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I CAN'T EVEN REALLY IDENTIFY ANY MISTAKES WE MADE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT WAS ALL PRETTY MUCH LIKE CLOCKWORK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: A 600 HOUR CAMPAIGN TO COMPLETE A GAME LIKE THIS IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND I HAVE ASKED ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT TURNS OUT ME AGREES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN OUR SESSION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SOLLUX HAS THE SAME INTUITION ABOUT IT AS ME, HE THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING FII2HY ABOUT IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT'S REALLY INSUFFERABLE THE WAY HER FISH PUNS HAVE RUBBED OFF ON HIM, IT KIND OF MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ANYWAY</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HE SAYS HE'S WORKING ON TRACING THE ORIGIN OF THIS DISASTER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IF I FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I WILL</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WASTE OF GOOD FRESH RAGE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I'M A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THE OLD THINGS I'VE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT'S GOTTEN SO STALE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IN A WEIRD WAY I'M SORT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOMETHING NEW TO BE PISSED OFF ABOUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO LIVE FOR NOW ANYWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SO I'M KEEPING MY PRONGS CROSSED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT WILL BE LIKE FUCKING 12TH PERIGEE'S EVE UP IN HERE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LAST SWEEP'S EVE WAS PROBABLY THE LAST HAPPY MEMORY I HAVE IN FACT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO FOR THE LAST HOLIDAY?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ANYONE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I REMEMBER MY LUSUS HAD BEEN GONE FOR DAYS AND I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT THEN HE FINALLY RETURNED, TRIUMPHANT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HE BROUGHT THE FRESH BEHEMOTH LEAVING INTO OUR HIVE, AND TOGETHER WE DECORATED IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DUNNO</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY, I'M GETTING A LUMP IN MY SQUAWK BLISTER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I GUESS I'M DONE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN NOW</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ON THE STEEL FLOOR OF THIS FRIGID METEOR DRIFTING THROUGH THE BLACK UNCARING VOID OF OUR NULL SESSION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NULL, KIND OF LIKE THIS MEMO I GUESS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LATER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CURRENT grimAuxiliatrix [CGA]</span> RIGHT NOW responded to memo.
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Dont Think We Did Anything Special</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHOA, HEY</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHAT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Last 12th</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: We Stayed In</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: And I Read Stories To Her It Was Nice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OH</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THAT'S COOL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE RESPONDED TO A MEMO THAT I CAN RECALL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU TOOK IT RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE THIS THING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Yeah I Know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Wasnt Sure If I Was Going To</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But Then I Noticed A Conversation In Which I Was A Participant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Which As It Turns Out Is The Conversation Taking Place Now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Scanned It Briefly And Then Perused Other Memos For My Presence</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Found None And Returned To This One</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But My Part Of The Conversation Was Gone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Regarded This As A Prompt To Begin Typing And Record My Contributions Live</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: That Is How This Works Isnt It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: PRETTY MUCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: FOR A WHILE IT WAS FRUSTRATING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHEN I DISCOVERED THE FEATURE I KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH ALL MY FUTURE MEMOS, NOT REALLY READING ALL OF THEM CAREFULLY OR THOROUGHLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN, AND THE WHOLE BOARD WAS GONE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BECAUSE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO I DID.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND THEN I KEPT MAKING MEMOS WITH ONLY FOGGY RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHILE ALL THESE OTHER CHUMPS FROM DIFFERENT TIMES KEPT GIVING ME SHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: INCLUDING MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD, BECAUSE AS I EVENTUALLY BECAME MY OWN FUTURE SELVES, AND GOT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDES OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND COULD DO MY PAST SELVES THE SERVICE OF INFORMING THEM HOW STUPID THEY WERE BEING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I STOPPED BOTHERING TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW ANY OF THESE MEMOS WENT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HONESTLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN A BLUR TO ME, JUST NON STOP YELLING AT MYSELF, HAGGLING WITH PAST AND FUTURE KNUCKLEHEADS, KILLING MONSTERS AND SOLVING PUZZLES, CYCLING THROUGH ALL THE GATES AND PLANETS LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES, ZIGZAGGING DOWN TO THE BATTLEFIELD, OUT TO THE VEIL, OVER TO PROSPIT, BACK TO DERSE, AND ON AND ON AND ON LIKE THAT UNTIL WE THOUGHT WE WON.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT WE DIDN'T WIN. WE LOST.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WE LOST AS HARD AS FAT GUYS FALL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: What Exactly Happened</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DID YOU READ THE MEMO JUST BEFORE THIS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: No</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: GIVE IT A READ, I'M DONE RANTING ABOUT ALL THAT FOR NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Alright</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: In A Moment</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT YEAH, THAT'S HOW TROLLIAN'S TIMELINE STUFF WORKS. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OR NOT! SINCE APPARENTLY THIS IS YOUR ONLY MEMO REPLY. YOU WERE PRETTY SHREWD IN SIDESTEPPING THIS WHOLE CLUSTERFUCK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: It Seems Like A Logical Way To Engineer A System Wherein One Simultaneously Functions As The Reader And Author Of The Transcripts</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Temporally Sound Construction</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HELL YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAID OF TIME THAN THE ONE WE WERE STUCK WITH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SHE'S COMPLETELY SHITHIVE MAGGOTS, DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Think We Are Given Roles To Challenge Us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: That Dont Necessarily Suit Our Strengths</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: At Least I Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Have No Idea What Im Doing Here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SURE YOU DO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OR, YOU WILL. TRUST ME YOU'LL DO FINE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SO WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO RESPOND ANYWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I MEAN ASIDE FROM BEING STRONGARMED BY CONVERSATIONAL PREDESTINATION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Oh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: At This Point Im Not Even Sure If Im Inclined To Ask Anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DO YOU REMEMBER IF THIS MEMO WAS MUCH LONGER THAN THIS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Um</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: There Is A Good Way To Go I Think Yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN MIGHT AS WELL SPIT IT OUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Such A Silly Question</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: RED OR BLACK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: What</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOUR PROBLEM, DOES IT PERTAIN TO REDROM OR BLACKROM INTERESTS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Thats Not What This Is About</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: COME ON. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THESE MEMOS TO SIFT THROUGH THEIR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS, I AM A FUCKING VETERAN AT THIS SHIT BY NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SERIOUSLY, I DON'T MIND, IT'LL BE A WELCOME REPRIEVE FROM SHOUTING AT MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Im Not Sure What To Say About It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DIDN'T YOU AT LEAST GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT WHEN YOU SKIMMED IT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Not Really</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: If I Were Thinking About It I Probably Wouldnt Have Wanted To Anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Dont You Think Its Better To Have Unrehearsed Conversations</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Even If The Subject Matter Is Awkward</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YES I COMPLETELY AGREE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT'S GOOD YOU DIDN'T READ IT. WE CAN AVOID THE SORT OF VERBAL SLAPSTICK ROUTINES I'M SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF BY NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I AM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE BEING ALL COY AND TELLING ME WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SAY BEFORE WE SAY IT, AND THEN WE WIND UP FUCKING SAYING IT ANYWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND THEN WE PROVE TO THE INVISIBLE RIDDLER THAT IS FATHER TIME BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS WE ALL ARE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD THAT GETS AFTER A WHILE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SO REALLY, TELL ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I KNOW IT'S ON YOUR MIND, I GOT A SENSE FOR THESE THINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: R OR B???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Red Then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But I Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Not Really Red Enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HAHA, WELL ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE CASE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: STORY AS OLD AS TIME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: EVEN IN PLACES WHERE STRICTLY SPEAKING TIME DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL RECENTLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHO'S THE TARGET OF THESE FLUSHED LEANINGS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Not The Asking I Mind</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its The Telling</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: In A Public Forum</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S READING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE ELSE JOIN IN LATER?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: No</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: It Appeared To Be Just The Two Of Us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SEE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NOBODY CARES ENOUGH TO BOTHER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Dont Know Whether Thats Reassuring</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Or Just A Bit Disheartening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WELL I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEIR DISINTEREST IS MORE A REFLECTION ON ME THAN YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Disinterest Is The Operative Concept Here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Shes Not Even Responding To My Messages Anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Could Be Busy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But Im Rapidly Approaching A Resolution To Discard The Preposterous Infatuation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SHE? WELL I GUESS THAT NARROWS IT DOWN SOMEWHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IF I THINK BACK ON EVENTS KNOWING THIS I COULD PROBABLY PIECE IT TOGETHER...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: How About</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: If I Agree To Consult With You About It In Private</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: We Can Drop It Here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Before You Crack Me Like A Vault</span>

<span style="color: #008141">CGA: With Your Weird Romance Sleuthing Acumen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ALRIGHT, DEAL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: It Still Puzzles Me That You Are So Versed In The Topic</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Do You Have Access To A Manual Archived On A Remote Server Somewhere</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHAT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NO OF COURSE NOT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THAT MUCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I JUST KNOW THIS STUFF WILL DRIVE YOU SHITHIVE MAGGOTS IF YOU DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: That Figure Of Speech You Keep Using Puzzles Me Too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: LIKE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NOT THAT I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE A SHIT BUT PERSONALLY I AM ALL TWISTED UP ABOUT BLACKROM STUFF ESPECIALLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I WAS CUT OUT TO HAVE A KISMESIS, I THINK MY STANDARDS ARE WAY TOO HIGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DID YOU KNOW THAT...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS FEELS SO INSANE TO ADMIT, BUT</span>
<br />
