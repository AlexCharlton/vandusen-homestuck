GT: I would have loved to give her a proper and dignified memorial like janes granddad got.

GT: God jane is so lucky every day in her household must be like weekend at bernies! What a riot it must be im so jealous.

TT: Yeah, what a fucking treat.

TT: A living room corpse party every goddamn day.

GT: I know right!!!

GT: Alas i had to dispose of the body with haste so the monsters wouldnt eat her.

GT: So i just made a little camp fire and burned it. I keep the ashes deep in the ruins which is where i think she liked it best.

GT: Hopefully there isnt an earthquake or something that would knock the urn over in a predictable and hilarious fashion.

TT: No way man.

TT: I'd bet my bottom boonbuck that shit's eternally safe.

TT: That urn's like the Fort Knox of standing upright forever because of no accidents.

GT: Heheh yeah.

GT: So then after camping out the next day i went exploring and found my room globe mostly intact sitting in the jungle so thats where i lived since.

GT: And thats pretty much it!

GT: I sure miss my grandma though she was the best.

TT: She was definitely very brave, if the stories are true. Downright audacious, I'd say.

GT: What did you hear?
