<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning</span>
