<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: navigating between bubbles is difficult here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: its better to drift between them naturally as they intersect</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: not spatially but through common points in memory</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: to navigate the furthest ring you need to have mastered the flow of time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: that is why i am here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: i am alive again so i may assist the dead in this way</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: time follows strange paths here as does space</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: if you travel a great enough distance you may discover you are also traveling either backwards or forwards in time as well!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: just as if you stay in one place for too long the geometry of space surrounding you will become unreliable</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">AA: you may swat the air to your left and discover you have just slapped yourself!</span>
<br />
