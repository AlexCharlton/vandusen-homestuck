AC: :33 < *she wiggles her rear end a bit and then chases something she s33s bounce into one of karkats shoes*

CG: KARKAT CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS TO SINK THIS LOW.

CG: KARKAT CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S ASKING AN AUTISTIC GIRL IN A CAVE TO JOIN HIS TEAM.

CG: KARKAT MYSTIFIES IN INFINITE BEFUDDLEMENT OVER THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PRESENTLY THE BEST REMAINING CANDIDATE FOR THE RED TEAM.

AC: :33 < i am???

AC: :33 < i mean *ac says i am??? wondrously*

CG: YES AND KARKAT CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THAT.

CG: KARKAT THINKS ABOUT THAT A BIT AND HIS JAW DROPS OPEN AND BREAKS A HUGE COLUMN OF BRICKS LIKE A FUCKING KUNG FU MASTER.

AC: :33 < *ac gathers up all the brick pieces and builds a cute little house and invites karkat inside*

CG: OK GOOD, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING.
