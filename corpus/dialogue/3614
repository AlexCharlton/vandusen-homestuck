GA: Im Supposed To Antagonize A Few Members Of Your Trivial Species

GA: I Have To Start Somewhere

GA: And Somewhen

GA: So I Am Starting With You

GA: And Now

GA: Its Going To Be Pointless And Unpleasant

GA: Mostly For Me

GA: Actually You Know What

GA: Im Not Really Feeling This At All

GA: Goodbye

TT: she's not here right now, she's asleep!

TT: but ok, see you.

GA: Is This

GA: Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About

GA: That You Always Use

GA: And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate

TT: umm... no?

GA: I Thought That Was The Thing You Did

GA: The Rose Human Specifically

TT: oh, yeah.

TT: that's me! i am the rose human. look at me, i am so smart with all these snooty words and complicated things to say.

TT: i am the queen of books.

GA: Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements

GA: Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful

TT: fffuuhhhhhhhh

TT: i'm so burned, these burns are crazy.

TT: can we just cut to the chase and be friends already??

TT: these cat and mouse games are so dumb, you know we're just going to all be friends at some point anyway.

GA: Have We Spoken Before

TT: i don't know, uh, maybe???

TT: it's hard to keep track with all your time nonsense.

GA: Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation

TT: that's because you guys always do things the hard way.

TT: and the dumb way.

GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works

GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like

TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.

TT: you look kind of like...

TT: howie mandel from little monsters.

TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.

TT: because he was a big goofy adult.

TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.

GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest

TT: no, it's a movie.

TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.

GA: It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things

GA: Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To

GA: He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is

TT: yeah, i got him this really cool bunny for his birthday, and it's really nicely knitted and everything.

TT: because i am basically in love with him, you are right.

GA: Uh Okay

TT: heh, just kidding. i'm sure john knows it's cause i am really thoughtful and i bet he really appreciates the present, and would say thank you if he were here!

GA: Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This

GA: I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now

TT: why don't you talk to john?

GA: Maybe

GA: When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him

TT: oh man, i don't know.

TT: why don't you pick the time that will make the most complicated mess out of everything imaginable?

TT: you know that's what you're gonna do anyway.

GA: Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart

GA: And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics

GA: I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here

GA: Kind Of Irritating

GA: Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades

GA: This John Human

GA: And Figure Out Whats Going On

TT: ok.

TT: if you talk to him in the past...

TT: he'll understand even less buggywhipped fuckall about time, and he'll be confused.

TT: so maybe paste something from this conversation to him? i don't know.

TT: and if you talk to him in the future...

TT: he'll probably know all this stuff, like things you've said to him but haven't said yet!

TT: and then you'll be confused.

TT: sorry, that's just how this works.

TT: don't say i didn't warn you!

GA: Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.

GA: Until Next Time Rose

GA: Next Time In The Past

TT: yeah, bye!

TT: (heheheheheheh)
