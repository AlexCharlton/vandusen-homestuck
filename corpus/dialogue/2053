EB: wow, ok.

EB: what do they do?

TT: I think it's up to you to find out.

TT: All I can do is drop stuff in your house, and move it around, apparently.

EB: how do i move stuff around? it sounds fun!

TT: I don't think you can as the client. You will need to install the server application.

TT: You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.

TT: Did you get another envelope in the mail?

TT: Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.

TT: Are you sure you didn't get it?

EB: oh man.

EB: i think i might know where it is.
