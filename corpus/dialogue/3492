GA: Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You

GA: I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism

GA: What Do You Think About This

TT: I think you're shrewd to have recognized his ploy of sabotage, and you've earned my compliments.

GA: Ah See It Is Working Already

TT: What is?

GA: Ive Listened To His Advice

GA: And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly

GA: I Know What I Have To Do

GA: What We Have To Do Really

TT: What's that?

GA: Remember The First Time We Spoke

TT: Yes, but you said it wasn't the first time you spoke to me.

TT: We'll graciously omit my embarrassing skepticism however.

GA: The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You

TT: This conversation doesn't sound like your first time either.

GA: This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You

TT: And when exactly does your maiden encounter take place?

GA: Thats Next Time

TT: So to clarify.

TT: If the matching of my first with your second is denoted by 1=2, then the sequence would be:

TT: 1=2, 2=7, 3=1, 4=?, ...

GA: Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply

GA: 4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6

GA: Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible

GA: But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That

TT: Why is it that when the subject of temporal mechanics is broached your sparing troll intellects etcetera etcetera.

GA: See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe

TT: You mean based on the first impression I am apparently about to make in our next conversation?

GA: Yes

TT: What could I possibly say that will leave such an imprint?

GA: That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now

GA: I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log



-- grimAuxiliatrix [GA] sent tentacleTherapist [TT] the file "ConversationWithAVeryStupidGirl.Txt" --



TT: I guess being forced to cooperate with a stable time loop is the only plausible explanation for my remarks.

GA: Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed

GA: I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant

TT: And what if my counter-counter measure is to choose not to transcribe this dialogue accurately in the future-first place?

GA: But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It

GA: So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless

GA: !

TT: Unless I decide to copy it word-for-word!

GA: Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place

GA: Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression

GA: !!!

TT: So your trolling strategy now is to put idiotic words in my mouth through the machinery of temporal inevitability, and cause me to excruciate over how to subvert the transcription?

GA: Yes

TT: While being perfectly up front about it?

GA: Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me

TT: I'll admit, it's a more advanced tactic than I gave you credit for.

GA: Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit

GA: The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw

TT: Mixed metaphor aside, usually ninjas don't announce what they're doing when they're doing it.

TT: Like when stalking an emperor to assassinate him.

TT: Or befriend him.

TT: But that's fine.

TT: I guess the only pointless question we haven't exhausted is, why?

TT: Why the convoluted artifice?

GA: Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development

GA: By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground

GA: In Successive Conversations

GA: 4=3 And 5=4 And Such

GA: Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation

GA: But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now

GA: They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation

TT: So you're not only rigging the first impression I make on you, but orchestrating my revenge for the rigging as well?

GA: Yes

GA: It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities

TT: That's an interesting take on it.

TT: But now I know for sure Dave isn't behind this plan.

TT: It's too complicated.

GA: I Dont Understand

GA: Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time

TT: You're awfully quick to his defense.

TT: Are you sure you don't have a thing for him?

TT: It's ok, bro. You can admit it.

GA: I'm Hopping To 8=8

GA: Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought

TT: Ok.

TT: I'm going to talk to my dead cat.
