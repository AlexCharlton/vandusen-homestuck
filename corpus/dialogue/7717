<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so im just talking to him a bit to help him not feel bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That's ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You were saying?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i was gonna say why i finally quit drinkin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i mean if you want to know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually, once you did stop, it made me finally realize it was a problem for you for a long time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I didn't say anything at the time, but it made me wonder if I wasn't doing the right thing before.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: By failing to point out you might have a problem? Or just going along with it and participating in lively banter any time you clearly had too much to drink?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Was I just being a bad friend?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: nah it wasnt your responsibility to fix my shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and anyway i think i made it hard for anyone to come at me like it was a real problem</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i was always joking around so much and havin a good time like kind of overzealously so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that i probably just made people feel like a shitty wet blanket for even mentioning it</span>
