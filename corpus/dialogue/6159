    <span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Tempting, but that rain check will have to stay unendorsed for now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Lil' Seb is beginning to act out, and I must put his fidgetiness to constructive use!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cool.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane, one more thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm sure you must be aware by now that you'll be the leader of our group, as you will be the first to enter the session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um, no?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This is news to me. I never gathered that &quot;team leader&quot; was a thing for this game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Trust me. It's a thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure? I have my doubts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I believe as a group we will have the temerity to succeed, without my having to order people around like an insufferable bossypants.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's why you're our leader, Jane.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hm?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Optimism through stalwart skepticism is an affect not everyone is plucky enough to be graced with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That's stupid!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah yeah. I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're not our leader, you're our FRIEND, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Precisely!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: There is a BIG difference!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And statements like that are also why you're our leader.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But only in name and in spirit. Less so, functionally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If it puts your mind at ease, I'll be the one pulling the strings here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh yes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then this whole affair will be one of D. Strider's grand productions in puppetry?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I will be the unseen hand whose nimble digits are behind every subtle twitch in our session's bulbous foam ass.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: At least those gyrations not happening by the volition of its own quivering absorbant proboscis.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If you ever need help, Jane. If you're ever in any trouble at all, let me know. Just say the word.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll whip the toggle stick of this ludicrous marionette, cavorting its humongous bottom to intercept your freefall through the abyss.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Snowcone you up in the fluffy crook of its cleft. Don't be alarmed if you're in no hurry to unpry yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For the great jut of this impudent rump has more yield to your touch than you ever dreamt. Remember to catch your breath as it cherishes the imprint of your hand like a memento from a lover gone to war.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's a lot of give to that ass, you may say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Might like to settle in. Make myself comfortable. Start a family.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Bounce a coin off that ass, you'll demand of visitors. It's not going anywhere.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Bet that coin'll take a good nap there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's a gamble you win every goddamn time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: These lessons we talked about...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: They've already begun, haven't they? :o</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane, soon you'll believe what I've told you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You'll believe it all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's just a shame that believing will take something so coarse as seeing, for a girl as sharp as you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Critical thought can lead one to accept the unlikely, just as much as dismiss the impossible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I can help with this too. Would you like me to program a Jane Crocker responder for you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I only require a simple captcha of your brain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Holy moly!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um, thank you, but no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm not ready to get dialogic with my cyberself just yet. My friends keep me busy enough as it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Speaking of which, I really need to go. I know you love to talk my ear off, and it's always a treat, but let's catch up later after the game starts, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And if I do need your help, I promise I'll take you up on your offer!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I made several. Which one?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The one where you, hopefully not literally, offered to catch me in the crevice of a great big squishy butt! Hoo hoo hoo!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Gtg!!! &lt;3</span>
