<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut the choice to do so came with accepting the annihilation of our existing forms. In the new instance, we would lead completely different lives with no memory of what happened.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So we did, and created A2. Your instance, your world, and your game in which we were all inexplica8ly created in the first place.</span>
