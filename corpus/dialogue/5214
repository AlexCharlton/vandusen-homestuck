GG: on no, is it trapped in ice?

GA: I Would Conjecture That Most Of Them Are

GA: And Will Stay That Way Until The Forge Is Brought To Life

GA: I Think The Event Is Designed To Trigger Drastic Planetary Upheaval Wherever The Forge Is Stationed

GA: It Did On My Planet As Well

GG: was your planet covered in ice too?

GA: No Mostly Water

GG: cool!

GG: anyway, i will try to rescue this frog

GG: so i push this button to appearify it?

GA: Yes

GA: It Probably Wont Do Any Good But You Can Try

GG: ok........
