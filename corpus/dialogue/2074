EB: tell me what is wrong with this picture.

TT: Sorry. I keep losing the wireless signal.

TT: Must be the weather.

TT: I would look for a stronger signal in another part of the house, but I'd rather not risk an encounter with my mother.

TT: I battled through her cloud of gin and derision once already this evening.

EB: haha, yeah I hear you.

TT: Yes. Cake, jesters, unfaltering love and support.

TT: Quite a road to hoe there.

TT: Though I suppose I'm complicit for not informing Social Services about your situation.

EB: i know!

EB: what about going outside?

EB: maybe you could catch a neighbor's signal.

TT: That presents the same problem.

TT: Also, it's raining, remember?

TT: And dark.

EB: It's dark already?

TT: Yes, the sun has already had its way with us here on the east coast.

TT: Its lurid glare has moved on to younger timezones.

EB: haha, um, ok.
