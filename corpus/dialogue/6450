<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's the point.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You got too sauced up and went rogue again. You're out there in your weird drifting stupor, independent of your waking self's awareness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you gonna go after me again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: get on your hornse</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *OOOMG blushblushbluh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In thinking it over, it's sort of a relief. Simplifies things somewhat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's better you stay out there for a while.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's been a problem.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whatd you do now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, I fucked up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I kind of made a mess here, and I'm not sure what to do about it yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ??&gt;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No need for you to worry about it for now. I'll figure something out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Until then I'm just going to prepare for our session, while I think it over.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: zzzzzz</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what a surprise another mysfery for you to keep to yourself an overly cerebralize</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: snooorre</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hey lets talk about something cool instead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like the dream i had</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: first i had some ordinary boring dreams that i dont remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but then i dreamed that i woke up from the drema</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and things got way bright and surreal</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i saw someone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i think it was supposed to be my daughter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why do you think that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you know those dreams where u just know someones suppose to be someone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: regulgar people have those im pretty sure all the time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are you thinking it was prophetic? Like a glimpse of the future?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dunno</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Because that's not really how the abyss works. It's not Skaia, and we aren't Prospit dreamers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's nothing like that out in the abyss. If you drift far enough, there is only horror.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Terrible, terrible horror.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok but im not sayin it was a futuredream!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it was just a glimple and it felt real and all im saying is it was a cool dream that i wish was real</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: * glimpse</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, maybe it was.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe there's no fanciful game-supplied mechanism of prognostication involved here, and you're just an ordinary, run of the mill psychic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess that's possible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hey dick</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *dirk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whaaaat do u think</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it would be like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: if we had kids</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What would it be like?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Inconvenient, mostly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no i mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what would they be like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: th kids</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: u ever think about it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Can't really say I have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you know for an eccantric guy you can be boring as fuck sometimes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sorry, Rox.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For what it's worth, I'm picturing them now. A boy and a girl.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Two perfect little freaks of nature raised by people who've clearly got no business bringin' up anybody.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: shuuuucks buster its just a fun lil hyphothetical to daydream about</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why you need to suck the fun out of shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like some turd hungry dracula</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What does le sign actually mean in this context?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh come on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Come on what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: LE SIGN IS UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOT TO MEAN TOO BAD HES GAY YOU DELIBERABLY OBTUSE DUNDERFUCK</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I mean, yeah, that's what I thought.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It would just be cool if you'd refrain from tossing about such antediluvian terms.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: antediulivan waht</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: me sayin ur gay u mean</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok but terminology aside i dont think im off base!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't see how it has to be a thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i rly think its an actual thing bro</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Once upon a time, sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the world has changed a lot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ever peek in a history book between your wizardly indulgences? This is a nuanced topic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: man i know about the histories</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: believe me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its a thig</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How is it a thing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its a thing beaucase if it wasnt a thing then u wouldnt be all like...........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: All like what?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't be ridiculous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have more to do with you than any dude could possibly bargain for.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I like it just fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what a totatly lame + sweet answer simultaneouslay</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now maybe we should direct our focus on a matter which has nothing at all to do with what does or doesn't qualify as &quot;a thing&quot;, or what our fantasy alt-universe offspring would be like, or anything like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Such as this game, and whether you're in the best condition to be piloting Jane's connection.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe you could use another nap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: my condidions just fine</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what aint gonna get slept offis the fact that i still dont think we should be touchin this bs witch game w a 20 foot 3dent</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: we both know her plans need us to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know that. But I thought we settled this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its still so frustrating</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: tellin jane about the dangers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and even if shes being polite i just know she thinks im fulla crap</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about EVREYTHING</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We settled this too. She'll believe everything eventually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why bother working so hard to convince her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well i dont even do that for the most part</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but it gets tiring and saddening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: knowing that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: even when were not activly talkin bout it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that my best friend cant bring herself to believe some really basic things about my life</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like the shitty things the baroness has done to us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or about our upbringin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: do u know how misrable it is for your bff to doubt you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: when you tell her your mom is dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It just registers for me as a reaction which isn't completely unreasonable from her perspective.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She is inundated with media coverage of those whom we've claimed as our parental figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That they are not presently alive nor ever played that role for us as she understands it is just an extension of a much more elaborate and far reaching explanation, which is much harder for anyone to digest in its entirety.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, anyone who isn't Jake, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Still say you should cut her some slack.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And need I remind you,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That the potential this game provides for their resurrection is what motivated you to investigate it in the first place?</span>
