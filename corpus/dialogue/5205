GA: Im Appreciating Our Conversations From This Timeframe More And More

GA: Past You Is Much Less Of A Taskmaster Than Future You Or Pre Blackout Rose

GG: thanks i think!

GG: what do you mean by pre blackout rose?

GA: I Mean Post Blackout Rose Is A Lot Less Difficult Insofar As She Is Unavailable

GG: umm, ok...

GG: but what do you mean by blackout???

GA: I Guess Youll Find Out Soon

GA: And Then Report It To Me Under Extremely Specific Circumstances

GA: Which Is Good Because I Sure Dont Know

GG: hmm @_@

GA: Yes Hmm And That Face Is A Good Response

GA: Your Eyes Are Right To Be Swirled Letters

GA: What Are You Doing

GG: im doing what you told me to do!

GG: im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment

GG: so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about

GG: which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :(

GA: I See

GA: Well I Didnt Actually Tell You To I Was Just Being Informative

GA: Also It Isnt Technically Witch Of Spacey Stuff

GA: I Was A Sylph Not A Witch

GG: oh

GG: what is a sylph?

GA: I Think Its Sort Of Like A Witch

GA: But More Magical

GG: a magical witch???

GA: Yes Im Completely Certain Of That Suddenly

GG: thats awesome

GA: But Regardless I Think Our Roles Are Approximately The Same Since We Are Both Stokers Of The Forge

GA: As Well As Holders Of Breeding Duties

GA: However I Should Clarify That My Earlier Counsel Was Mostly Academic

GA: It Takes Weeks To Do All Of It Properly

GA: You Wont Have Time

GG: breeding duties?????
