TT: Whether you have something to do with it or not.

TT: You might as well ask me.

TT: At least when it happens, you'll understand what it is that's happening.

TT: And just maybe, if we're really lucky, so will I.

GA: Um

TT: I have a question for you too.

TT: Let's swap ignorance, ok?

GA: Alright

GA: I Cant See You In The Future

GA: The Viewport Wont Let Me After A Certain Point

GA: Its Black

GA: But Only For You

GA: Not The Others

TT: When?

GA: Several Hours From Now

GA: Do You Know Why This Could Be

TT: I have no idea.

TT: I can't see the future.

TT: I'm a disreputable Derse Dreamer, remember?

TT: But I promise that if I have a hand in it, it won't be because you told me.

TT: That's a pity.

TT: Who will make sure my soul isn't forfeit in service of gods then?

GA: Well

GA: I Hope That Doesnt Happen

GA: But Id Rather Not Get Stuck In That Kind Of Pattern Again

GA: So If You Want To Wreck Turtle Villages And Tear Your Planet Apart On The Counsel Of Dark Gods

GA: Fine With Me I Guess

TT: What do you mean, "again?"

GA: Ur

GA: Ill Do The Thing You Do When You Dont Say Anything

GA: "..."

TT: One simple word can so easily begin a story in a very thick book.

TT: But I guess we won't open this one?

GA: What Was Your Question

GA: I Believe Youre Owed Some Compensatory Ignorance

TT: Yes.

TT: I was wondering.
