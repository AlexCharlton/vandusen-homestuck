uu: WE DON'T GOT SISTERS. IT'S NOT A THING. DON'T DRAG uS THROuGH YOuR NASTY HuMAN FAMILIAL MuD.

uu: OF COuRSE I'M GOING TO PLAY. I WAS JuST SAYING I WOuLDN'T. YOu KNOW. TO FuCK WITH HER AND MAKE HER CRY.

uu: LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. BuT TO PLAY.

uu: HOW ELSE AM I GOING TO GET OFF THIS DESOLATE ROCK?

uu: YOu THINK I WANT TO STAY HERE? JuST HANG AROuND. TIL I JOIN THE HuNDRED BILLION CORPSES FERTILIZING THE SOIL?

TT: I see.

TT: No, didn't think so. I was just curious.

uu: HuMAN CuRIOSITY IS CONTEMPTIBLE. SHE SHARES THAT WITH YOu. AND I CAN'T FuCKING STAND IT.

TT: Gotcha.

TT: You sure seem to hate us, but I notice it doesn't stop you from talking to us frequently. Or at least to me.

TT: Surely there must be at least one of our virtues you admire.

uu: YES. AMBITION. THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD ONE.

uu: AND I THINK YOu GOT THAT. WHICH IS MAYBE WHY. YOu'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN PuT uP WITH FOR ANY DuRATION?

uu: LET'S CALL IT A GRuDGING RESPECT. WHICH IS THE ONLY KIND THAT'S EVEN WORTH A FuCK.

TT: I'll take that as a rare overture of friendship.

uu: NO. DON'T.

TT: So, do you even know how this is going to work?

uu: WHAT.

TT: Your session. Can you even really have a session with only two players?

uu: SHE SAYS YOu CAN. AND SHE LIKES TO THINK SHE'S THE EXPERT.

uu: PERSONALLY? I DON'T CARE.

uu: MAYBE IT'S AGAINST THE RuLES. WHAT WE'RE DOING.

uu: I JuST WANT TO GET IN THERE. AND JuST.

uu: FuCK.

uu: SHIT.

uu: uP.

TT: Yeah.

TT: I sensed that was your plan.

TT: Which is kind of what I'm talking about. How can you win like that?

TT: I thought the point was to cooperate with your coplayers to achieve an objective.

TT: Not compete with them or try to kill them. I don't think we've had one conversation where you didn't express the desire to kill her.

uu: I GuESS WE'LL JuST HAVE TO SEE. WON'T WE?

uu: I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A DIFFERENT KIND OF SESSION.

uu: ONE WHERE THE PLAYERS FIGHT FOR SuPREMACY. RATHER THAN WORK TOGETHER.

uu: I THINK THAT IT MuST BE THAT WAY.

uu: BECAuSE THAT IS HOW I WANT IT TO BE.

uu: AND IF I WANT SOMETHING TO BE TRuE HARD ENOuGH. THEN THAT MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE ABSOLuTELY IRREFuTABLE.

uu: ARE YOu FEELING ME, FuCKER?

TT: Maybe you're right.

TT: But since that's how you feel now, maybe the truth is that the game is challenging you to overcome those feelings?

TT: What if your real quest is to put aside your differences and work together, if you want to both survive, and grow as a person?

uu: NO.

uu: NO. NO. NO.

uu: FuCK THAT SHIT.

uu: HuMAN FuCK THAT SHIT. NOT EVEN ALIEN FuCK THAT SHIT. SO YOu CAN uNDERSTAND BETTER. THE KIND OF FuCKING OF THE SHIT THAT'S GOING ON.

uu: HuMAN FuCK IT SO MuCH. SO HARD, AND SO ANGRILY.

TT: Yeah, I didn't think you'd dig that idea.

TT: Just puttin' it out there.

uu: HOW ABOuT YOu SHuT uP? AND GET ON THE ROOF. AND TAKE YOuR FuCKING PuNISHMENT.

uu: NOW WHERE THE HELL IS YOuR GHASTLY JuJu.

uu: GO GET IT. AND HuRRY uP.

TT: My juju?
