<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Gotcha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You sure seem to hate us, but I notice it doesn't stop you from talking to us frequently. Or at least to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Surely there must be at least one of our virtues you admire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">uu: YES. AMBITION. THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD ONE.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is kind of what I'm talking about. How can you win like that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought the point was to cooperate with your coplayers to achieve an objective.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not compete with them or try to kill them. I don't think we've had one conversation where you didn't express the desire to kill her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">uu: I GuESS WE'LL JuST HAVE TO SEE. WON'T WE?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe you're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But since that's how you feel now, maybe the truth is that the game is challenging you to overcome those feelings?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What if your real quest is to put aside your differences and work together, if you want to both survive, and grow as a person?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">uu: NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">uu: NO. NO. NO.</span>
