GG: ...

GG: Yeah sure why the hell not.

GG: What, are you expecting me to advocate a more conservative approach?

GG: To tell you to keep being shy and cagey and keep beating around the bush indefinitely??

GG: What would ever give you that idea about me!

GT: Jane the decision to sire children with your best bro is not one to be taken lightly.

GG: Okay I think I have to go.
