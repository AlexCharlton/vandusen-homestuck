    <span style="color: #b536da">TT: They've revealed some of their secrets to me already, and given me a few errands to run.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This is why you might have observed some unusual behavior from me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh shit youre kidding</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: fuck mind = blown</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Once these convulsions of explosive laughter subside and finish rocking my very foundation,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I might point out that you haven't really been as astute as you're implying.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You've deliberately fogged your vision your entire life with ironic eyewear while awake, and while asleep, though perfectly alert, you've chosen to ignore your surroundings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But now that you've seen them, you have a choice to make.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They will only tell me so much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They would like an audience with the prince of the moon as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We are like the emissaries to what lies beyond this small bubble in their unfathomable dark foam.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Derse skirts its edge, and during the lunar eclipse, we graze it, and that's when their intent for us becomes clear.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm doing my part, but they have a mission for you as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what am i supposed to do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Listen to them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: My understanding is,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They will teach you how to navigate the unnavigable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The result should be a map.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: a treasure map</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Something a little more astronomical.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Like a star chart with no stars.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hence the challenge.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: To plot a course through the Furthest Ring.</span>
