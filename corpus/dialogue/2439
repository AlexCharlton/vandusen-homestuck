TT: Have you ever been in there?

EB: no.

TT: Exactly.

EB: huh?

TT: I'd rather not get sidetracked.

TT: I'm more interested in further exploring the mechanics of the game than watching you discover what sort outlandish harlequin decor your father keeps in his room.

EB: oh come on. what's the big deal, i'll just climb up and go right through!

TT: Will you?

EB: yeah, why not?

TT: Are you saying you've never wondered what's in there? Or why it's been kept a secret from you?

EB: well, i mean yeah...

TT: Then trust me. You won't be going "right on through."

EB: wait, are you saying there's something, like...

EB: troubling in there?

TT: I don't know.

EB: what do you mean? what do you see in there?

TT: I can't see in there.

EB: oh.

TT: But I don't have a very good feeling about it.

EB: pfff...

EB: whatever!

EB: i think i can handle a few more stupid clown paintings.
