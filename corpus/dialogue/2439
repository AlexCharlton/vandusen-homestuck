    <span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so why didn't you just build a way up through that hole into my dad's room?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Have you ever been in there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'd rather not get sidetracked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm more interested in further exploring the mechanics of the game than watching you discover what sort outlandish harlequin decor your father keeps in his room.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh come on. what's the big deal, i'll just climb up and go right through!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Will you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, why not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you saying you've never wondered what's in there? Or why it's been kept a secret from you?</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, i mean yeah...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then trust me. You won't be going &quot;right on through.&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I can't see in there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I don't have a very good feeling about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: pfff...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: whatever!</span>
