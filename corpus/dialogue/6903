    <span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Instead of storming off to the moon in a huff, Peixes em8raced her role as an heiress.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Once she reached the age to challenge the empress, she killed her predecessor easily.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She did more to sink our race into perpetual darkness and violence than any empress before her, and her rule lasted the longest 8y far.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She conquered thousands of planets and star systems, many of them personally. She was responsi8le for the death of trillions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Her reign was interrupted only 8y the extinction of our race, which was orchestrated 8y the omniscient creep I mentioned previously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She flew back to her homeworld, killed Megido, and assumed control of her demonic powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In doing so, she also assumed her role as the servant to an indestructi8le demon, whose existence was a8out to result in the annihilation of our universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut 8efore that, he had a new assignment for her.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: That's the first half of her story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In the second half, she escaped to a fresh universe to wreak more havoc.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She infiltrated a planet called Earth, which is home to a race called humans. These guys here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: On the post-scratch version of Earth (long story), she gained a8solute power, flooded the planet, and completely wiped out the human population, while expanding her a8ilities even further.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She then somehow entered the humans' game session, and took control there as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She did all this at the 8ehest of her employer, and has shown no signs of slowing her rampage, or ever dying, for that matter.</span>
