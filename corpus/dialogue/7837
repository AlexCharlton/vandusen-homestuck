    <span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what do you actually want from her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: YES! I WANT HER TO DO THAT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: THE LATTER THING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah i can understand where youre coming from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: DAVE</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: REGARDING GAMZEE, YEAH. I KNEW ABOUT THAT ALREADY.</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: GOD, I WONDER WHAT SORT OF BULLSHIT HE'S GOT HER BELIEVING IN NOW? ABOUT THE MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS AND SHANGRI LA AND ALL THAT GARBAGE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT MAKES ME SO SAD TO THINK SHE'S CAUGHT UP IN HIS SUPERSTITIOUS WEB OF LIES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: IT'S BEEN AWFUL WATCHING THE PERSON I USED TO KNOW SLOWLY DRIFT AWAY FROM ME, TO THE POINT WHERE SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE GONE.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: she started sneaking around in vents and stuff acting suspicious trying to hide the fact that she was seeing him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like she was obviously ashamed of it and worried how id react</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but it was hella transparent that was going on so i just said</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: AND JOHN AND I HAD A FEW TESTY CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER ONE DAY, AND IN MOST OF THOSE I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: AND I GUESS WE BECAME FRIENDS THAT DAY? MAYBE??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: BUT THE REALITY IS IT WAS JUST ONE DAY, AND HE'D BE WELL WITHIN A REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND NOT TO GIVE A CRAP IN HINDSIGHT ABOUT THE GUY WHO TROLLED HIM ONCE THREE YEARS AGO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: AND THE SAME GOES FOR JADE!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: I CAN HARDLY CALL GAMZEE A FRIEND ANYMORE. WHO KNOWS IF MY FRIENDSHIP WITH TEREZI WILL EVER BE WHAT IT WAS BEFORE. I USED TO BE PRETTY CLOSE WITH KANAYA, BUT NOW SHE AND ROSE NEVER LEAVE EACH OTHER ALONE FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING MINUTE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS ARE DEAD, AND NOW WE'RE LEAVING THE DREAM BUBBLES BEHIND.</span>
