<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hello?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh my! You answered!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You never answer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: don't i?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well, no. I don't mean to be accusatory.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I am just surprised.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: right then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: what can i do for yoU?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well... nothing in particular. Just thought it would be nice to catch up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was beginning to think I was the only one of my friends left alive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe this gloomy place full of salamander bones and dusty old relics is starting to get to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not to mention the most unwelcome presence of entrepreneurial clowns and their enormous codpieces.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: coUld be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm still trying to track down my father. I've been gathering clues, and I may be getting close.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Do you by any chance know if I might see him soon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hmm...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh. yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: keep going where yoU're headed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: things will work oUt in time. yoU'll see him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Phew! That's nice to know. Thanks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You aren't usually forthcoming with future tidbits. Er, not that I was always especially eager to believe you about them anyway.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I think I've been coming around on that lately, for what it's worth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So, um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hey.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you ok there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You seem rather preoccupied.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm sorry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am not having the best day. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What's wrong?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: everything!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: where do i bloody begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is it your brother?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well that goes withoUt saying doesn't it? he is ALWAYS a problem.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it's more than that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: when i sleep and visit prospit, i see nothing bUt storm cloUds in skaia now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my great big lovely ball of blUe has been cloUding over. soon i fear it will be completely black, and the kingdom will be shroUded in darkness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wish i Understood the meaning of this terrible omen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That sounds awful!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and my brother has become more Uncooperative than ever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he intends to play the game, bUt refUses to treat it like a collaboration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have told him many times that the only way we can win is to work together! bUt he wants it to be yet another competition between Us, like everything has been all oUr lives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: his threats to kill me have become harder to dismiss as his UsUal empty bravado.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i fear it may come down to having to kill him first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: althoUgh i am not sUre exactly how i woUld go aboUt this, or if i will even be Up to the task. umu;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had no idea things had gotten this grim for you. I am so sorry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. bUt i'll cope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the real troUble thoUgh is i'm not sUre if i can play a sUccessfUl session withoUt him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a two player session was already risky enoUgh, satisfying bare minimUm playing conditions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and i had it on good aUthority that the two of Us woUld be able to sUcceed, particUlarly given oUr... well, withoUt intending to boast. varioUs advantages.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have no idea if a session of one is viable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: honestly i cannot for the life of me imagine how.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it may well resUlt in a void session like yoUrs, bUt withoUt the promise of any extenUating circUmstances.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure it's hopeless with him? You can't reach a truce, just for the sake of playing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i Used to hope so, bUt i doUbt it now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he barely cares aboUt the game itself, other than as a means of escaping oUr planet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he has always been more motivated by the ongoing game between Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think you have alluded to this before, but I never really understood.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is simple. we are playing a game together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we have been forced to, for as long as we've known each other.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt the rUles are complicated, and often shifting. and they don't always make sense!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: at least, they woUldn't to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Try me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: many yoU woUld not recognize as rUles, so mUch as sUperstitions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a variety of caveats and stipUlations. things that woUld invite misfortUne if i were to break. it woUld be very bad jUjU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have not been able to tell yoU my name for this reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: doing so woUld lead Us all down a very slippery slope! bUt i have wanted to tell yoU so. i hope my relUctance has not compromised oUr friendship.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Of course not. I wrote off your reticence as one of your many eccentricities long ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I still want to understand this game with your brother, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Could you describe some of the other rules?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: mm, yes. we have both renoUnced hemotyping Until the resolUtion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hemotyping?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is in the same vein, pardon the pUn, as a qUirk. it's the old tradition whereby one types in his or her own blood coloUr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so he and i have embraced neUtral tones to speak in, for the time being.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: most hUmans do not practice hemotyping, presUmably dUe to lacking diversity in blood class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But your race has varied blood color?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then what would yours be?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am a lime blood. UuU</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while he's got the bright cherry blood, jUst like yoU all do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not that this matters since we are alone here, bUt interestingly, in ancient troll cUltUre we woUld both be considered pariahs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for different reasons of coUrse. those of his blood coloUr were very rare, existing by way of genetic glitch only. they were oUtcasts, having no place in the social order.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on the other hand, those of my blood coloUr were once actUally qUite common! bUt later they were all hUnted to extinction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jeez. Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: details of the genocide are historically mUrky. it's one of those maddening voids in my Understanding of yoUr elaborate epic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have specUlated their extermination had to do with the extremely powerfUl abilities they tended to have, and the threat to aUthority they represented. even more so than other powerfUl lowbloods.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you saying you have such powers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: maybe. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But he does not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he has other, Um. traits.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe he is jealous of you, which is why there is such resentment?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, probably. he is an oUtright mess. if yoU can name a problem with me, he's got it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The way you described it, I had always envisioned your contentious relationship as one played out mostly online.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. it is!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And also that you and he had never met. Yet some things you have said lately appear to contradict this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sigh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jane, i am sorry, bUt this is something i jUst cannot get into. for one thing we woUld be creeping way too close to breaking the rUles, and then we woUld all be bUggered.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: even if i were at liberty to say, it woUld take so mUch time to explain everything. and i really mUst be getting to sleep again soon. i am terribly worried aboUt the people of prospit dUring sUch dark times.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sUffice to say, all games that are played have boUndaries. a stage to which all pieces and moves are confined.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: like a chess board! there is no reality to the game beyond the edges of the binary grid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That makes sense, but I'm not sure I see how it applies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know. it was more infernal gammoning on my part as i dance aboUt these rUles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's all one can do when everything he or she ever does is jUst another move in a game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am so sorry, jane. i woUld have loved to be more forthright with yoU since the day we first spoke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU are a dear friend to me. yoU and yoUr chUms. yoU are all the only friends i have ever had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: uUu</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i was planning on giving yoU a gift.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You were??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, bUt i was going to wait Until completing my qUest before sending it to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt now that things are looking rather bleak here, i may have to consider accelerating the delivery.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What is it? Or is it a surprise?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is a sUrprise! bUt i will tell yoU this mUch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is my jUjU. it is very dear to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Your juju?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a talisman of sorts, with many cUrioUs properties and rUles for implementation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as yoU may have gathered aboUt me, i have learned the hard way that it always pays to follow the rUles. :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Where did you get it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it was an heirloom, yoU coUld say. passed on from ancestors. i have always had it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUjUs are said to have origins which are impossible to Understand or trace. some say they emerge spontaneoUsly from the void.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: they cannot be trUly dUplicated. if there ever appears to be more than one of the same, it is only a mirage of caUsality!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: nor can they ever be destroyed. not completely, at least.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so when i send yoU mine, it will be no small matter. it will not simply be copied throUgh alchemy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU will be the new owner, and mine here will cease to exist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um... gosh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt UnfortUnately it will have no valUe to yoU Unless i send my brother's jUjU as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and he will not relinqUish control of his Unless i best him at oUr game. this is another of oUr rUles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It sure sounds like you two are up to your necks in this crazy game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh yes. we are Up to qUite a bit fUrther than oUr neck in it. ~_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it's alright. i love games.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my brother, on the other hand...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not such a big fan of games?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on no, qUite the contrary.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: his passion for games transcends any hUman Understanding of love.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for yoU to Understand it woUld be to fUlly comprehend the meaning of...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: how to pUt it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Beauty?</span>
