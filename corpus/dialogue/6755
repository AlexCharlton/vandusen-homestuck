GT: She even built that big fancy house we used to live in so i guess she really wanted to settle here for a while.

GT: But she didnt come home from her expedition for a couple days so i started to get worried.

GT: I followed the trail we usually take to the lagoon while keeping my eyes peeled for monsters.

GT: But instead i found her lying there dead.

GT: I think a monster caught her off guard. There were three big fang marks in the body and a trail of blood along the path.

GT: It looked like she was trying to get home but couldnt make it before succumbing to the injury.

GT: But before i could even do anything about it i heard an explosion. I looked back at the hill and my house was gone!
