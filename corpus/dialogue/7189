<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i love nic cage. he is basically my hero, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i'm kind of just realizing now that he is EMBARRASSINGLY BAD in this movie!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he is just doing this corny parody of a southern guy who is down on his luck, and acts &quot;charming&quot; with his goofy accent and stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: some things i used to think were so badass are just coming off as ridiculous now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: can you believe that one time we were watching this movie, when he said &quot;put the bunny back in the box&quot; i actually high fived my dad?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: this time that line just made me roll my eyes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there's so much crappy dialogue!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: &quot;cyrus, this is your barbecue, and it tastes good...&quot; arrgh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but he was trying to sound like a hardened criminal to win the trust of john malkovich!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: jade, please. it was a cheesy line, don't be so naive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: you spent your whole life worshiping this dumb movie and now youre calling ME naive????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, i'm sorry. i guess in fairness to you, you have only just begun to climb the steep learning curve of this vexing and hypnotic film.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i am no longer bound by its spell, jade.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: oh god</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: vexing and hypnotic??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its a movie full of explosions about a guy with a mullet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what is with you lately? you seem to be in such a crappy mood these days</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i am fine. this MOVIE is what's crappy these days.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: oh bluh bluh</span>
