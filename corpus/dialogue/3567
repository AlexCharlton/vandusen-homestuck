CG: TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER HOW YOU BOTCH THIS UP SO BADLY.

CG: AND I KEEP FINDING THESE STRIKING POCKETS OF FOOLISHNESS.

CG: LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW.

CG: RIDING YOUR LITTLE RED ROCKET.

CG: LIKE YOU ARE A FRESHLY HATCHED HUMAN LARVA AND THIS IS JUST ALL A BIG SCHOOLHIVE RUMPUS RESPITE.

EB: humans aren't hatched as larvae dummy.

EB: we don't hatch at all.

EB: we are born as these like little pink monkeys called babies.

CG: BULLSHIT.

CG: THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME.

EB: what did i say?

CG: I'LL PASTE WHAT YOU SAID.

EB: i thought you didn't like going down that road?

EB: copy-pasting future/past conversations...

CG: WHY WOULD I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

EB: i dunno, that's what you just told me.

CG: WHATEVER, LOOK:

CG: EB: this is really weird...

CG: CG: WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.

CG: EB: well, normally humans hatch...

CG: EB: from like these slimy pods.

CG: EB: then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.

CG: CG: OH REALLY.

CG: CG: HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.

EB: hahaha!

EB: i was punking you dude!

EB: or at least i will be in our next conversation.

EB: thanks for the great prank idea.

CG: ARGH.

CG: WHY WOULD YOU TRICK ME ABOUT THAT, WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT.

EB: i don't know, it was just a friendly prank.

EB: don't you ever play pranks?

EB: i mean, of course you do, one of you just tried to prank me good.

CG: WHAT, WHO.

EB: pffffff, you'll find out.

CG: WELL FINE.

CG: I GUESS YOU GOT ME BACK, SORT OF.

CG: FOR MY TROLLING, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T EVEN READ MY WORST TROLLING EFFORTS YET.

CG: BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN IN YOUR FUTURE.

CG: AND EVEN THEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN MIND MUCH, ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT.

CG: KIND OF PERVERSE REALLY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

EB: well, we're friends by then, aren't we?

EB: or sort of like, uh, reverse anti-mutual friends.

CG: WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN MEAN.

EB: look, you're going to have to face it at some point...

EB: that you're learning the meaning of this human emotion called friendship.

CG: IS FRIENDSHIP REALLY AN EMOTION?

EB: yes, absolutely.

CG: I GUESS IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW WE BECOME FRIENDS.

CG: THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

CG: EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK INTO YOUR PAST AND TALK TO YOU, YOU SAY STUFF THAT PERTAINS TO MY IMMEDIATE FUTURE.

CG: AND THEN YOU WON'T EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON, BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY OLD NEWS FOR YOU.

EB: dude, you've been doing the same exact thing!!!

CG: I'VE DONE NO SUCH THING.

CG: I'VE BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.

CG: IF JUSTIFIABLY ACRIMONIOUS.

EB: you never answer my questions, though.

EB: how am i supposed to know what's going on, or what you're alluding to?

CG: THIS GAME IS KIND OF A GAME OF A MILLION GUIDES.

CG: EVERYWHERE YOU TURN THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, SO PLEASE, GO SECRETE ME AN EARTH RIVER THROUGH YOUR STRANGE HUMAN TEAR DUCTS.

CG: YOU'VE GOT SPRITES, EXILES, GUARDIANS, CONSORTS...

CG: TIME HOPPING FUTURE SELVES, MYSTICAL DREAM ORACLE DOPPELGANGERS...

CG: AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, YOUR PARTICULAR GROUP OF PLAYERS IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE US TO GIVE YOU THE SCOOP ON STUFF.

CG: THROUGH A SORT OF SUBVERSION OF THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

CG: EVEN THOUGH WE HATE YOU.

CG: AND EVEN THOUGH THE FACT THAT WE HATE YOU

CG: IS AN IMMUTABLE FACT AS UNALTERABLE AS THIS WRITHING KNOTTED HELL OF A TIMELINE CHOKING US ALL TO DEATH

CG: IT DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE ANY REASON TO WITHHOLD ANY INFORMATION FROM YOU

CG: OR DISH IT OUT THROUGH CRYPTOBAFFLING MIND FUDDLERY.

CG: SO GO AHEAD, ASK ME ANYTHING.

EB: ok...

EB: what's the point of the game.

CG: ASK SOMETHING ELSE.

CG: ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT.

CG: IT WAS THIS WHOLE BIG CONVERSATION WE HAD.

EB: augh!

EB: fine.

EB: where are you now?

CG: IN THE MEDIUM.

CG: A SEPARATE SESSION FROM YOURS.

EB: no no, i know that!

EB: you already told me.

CG: I DID?

EB: yes, in your future.

CG: DAMMIT.

EB: what i mean is...

EB: are you in your house right now, or in one of your magical lands, or what?

EB: just curious cause you can see me, but i can't see or know anything about you!

CG: WE'RE HIDING IN THE VEIL.

CG: WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.

EB: what's that?

CG: IT'S A HUGE BELT OF METEORS

CG: ORBITING WAY OUTSIDE SKAIA, BEYOND THE ORBIT OF THE PLANETS

CG: DIVIDING THE MEDIUM FROM THE FURTHEST RING

CG: WHERE DERSE ORBITS.

EB: derse?

CG: THE DARK PLANET.

CG: PROSPIT'S THE LIGHT ONE NEAR SKAIA.

EB: well jeez, how am i supposed to know any of this??

CG: YOU'D PROBABLY FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER FROM YOUR DUMB GRANDMA.

CG: BUT BY FUSING WITH THE SPRITE SHE HAS TO WITHHOLD STUFF AND BE MYSTERIOUS AND ALL.

CG: TO MAKE YOUR ADVENTURE SEEM MORE "MAAAAAAGICAL!!!!"

CG: IT'S INFURIATING.

EB: ok, so the veil is a bunch of meteors...

EB: what do you mean "what's left of it"?

CG: OK, THERE COMES A TIME WHEN BLACK INEVITABLY BEATS WHITE

CG: ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN THE CENTER OF SKAIA

CG: THE WHITE KING IS CAPTURED OR KILLED OR SOMETHING

CG: THAT'S WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS.

EB: ok...

CG: THE RULERS OF DERSE

CG: THE BLACK KING AND QUEEN

CG: GET THE POWER TO SEND THE VEIL TOWARD SKAIA

CG: TO DESTROY IT

CG: THAT KIND OF STARTS YOUR BIG "COUNTDOWN"

CG: WHEN SHIT GETS SERIOUS.

EB: so then it's up to us to save it?

CG: YEAH, YOU HAVE THAT LONG TO KILL THE BLACK QUEEN AND KING

CG: AND SKAIA ITSELF SORT OF BUYS YOU SOME TIME

CG: BY ACTIVATING ITS DEFENSE PORTALS

CG: TO CATCH SOME OF THE METEORS

CG: THE THREAT GETS BIGGER THE LONGER YOU TAKE THOUGH

CG: SMALLER METEORS COME FIRST AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY BIGGER AND BIGGER

CG: AND THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH OF THEM SKAIA CAN ABSORB FOR YOU.

EB: ok, but it sounds like we've got plenty of time before that happens, right?

CG: THAT'S JUST IT.

CG: YOU DON'T.

CG: ORDINARILY YOU WOULD BUT

CG: YOUR RECKONING STARTS MUCH SOONER

CG: BECAUSE OF SOME DUMB THINGS YOU'VE DONE

CG: YOU COMPLETELY BLEW IT ALREADY AND YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING ANYMORE

CG: WHICH ORDINARILY WOULD BE FINE

CG: JUST ANOTHER BUNCH OF LOSERS TO FAIL AT THIS GAME

CG: IT'S WHAT YOU DO LATER THAT CAUSES SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT

CG: AND NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT TOO.

EB: oh no...

EB: what is it?

CG: ALREADY TOLD YOU.

CG: IT'S INEVITABLE AND COMPLETELY POINTLESS TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY.

EB: yeah, well...

EB: maybe you're wrong!

EB: maybe there's something we can still do to stop it, if you just help us?

CG: I'M NOT WRONG, IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME, YOU FUCK UP ROYALLY, END OF STORY.

EB: ok, we'll see about that, mr. sourbulge.

EB: hey, aren't you kind of uncomfortable sitting on a meteor?

EB: are you all huddled in a crater or something?

CG: NO, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CRAZY SHIT IN THE VEIL.

CG: A LOT OF THESE METEORS ARE KIND OF LIKE...

CG: BIG SEEDS.

EB: seeds?

EB: um...

EB: well, what kind of crazy shit is there?

CG: STUFF LIKE...

CG: BUILDINGS

CG: FACILITIES

CG: LIKE LABS AND STUFF.

EB: weird.

CG: YEAH, THE VEIL IS KIND OF LIKE NEUTRAL GROUND FOR THE KINGDOMS, LIKE OUR PLANETS.

CG: SOME PLACES ARE USED TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER SOLDIERS AND AGENTS FOR THE TWO SIDES.

CG: USING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM THE EXOTIC MENAGERIE OF CHESS PIECES ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

CG: TO HELP FUEL THE WAR AND KEEP RAISING THE STAKES.

EB: wow, i don't think i'm following this.

CG: YEAH NO SHIT!

CG: BUT YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE

CG: SINCE YOU WERE IN THE VEIL WHEN WE LAST TALKED.

CG: ANYWAY THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH INFO FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND BE LESS STUPID IN TIME FOR CONVERSATIONS WE'VE ALREADY HAD.

CG: I'M OUT OF HERE.

EB: ok, but wait...

EB: can you give a message to GC for me?

EB: tell her nice try.

CG: WHAT

CG: WHY WOULD I GIVE HER A MESSAGE FOR YOU

CG: DO IT YOURSELF, I'M NOT A RELAY SERVICE.

EB: oh, well i thought you'd be cool with it since you asked me to give her a message for you last time.

EB: but whatever.

CG: I FIND THAT HIGHLY IMPLAUSIBLE.

CG: I'M NOT FALLING FOR ANY MORE OF YOUR HUMAN PRANKS.

CG: "NICE TRY" JOHN

CG: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
