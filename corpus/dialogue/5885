PCG: YOU JUST APPEARIFY ITS GHOST IMPRINT, MIX IT WITH YOUR CURRENT EVOLUTION'S PARADOX SLIME, SMOOTH OUT THE GENETIC WAVEFORM, TADPOLIFY BILIOUS SLICK, AND YOU'RE DONE.

?GG: hopefully!

PCG: SO YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING THIS FROG WHEN YOU WERE A KID AT ALL?

?GG: no, it completely slipped my mind

PCG: HOW DID SHE GET YOU TO REMEMBER?

PCG: I MEAN, WHAT DID SHE MAKE YOU AGREE TO?

?GG: well, like it was before

?GG: the choices she gives you seem to have to do with facing mortality

?GG: and making it clear if you choose one path over another it will lead to your death

?GG: and that your death may even be necessary to accomplish a goal

FGA: Yes Ive Inferred Their Ultimata Are All Personalized Variations On The Presentation Of Such Dilemmas

?GG: yeah

?GG: but

?GG: that is not really what made this hard

?GG: i mean

?GG: nobody wants to die of course

?GG: but at least...

?GG: that is a clear thing

?GG: you either do you you dont

?GG: you know?

PCG: YOU SAID WHAT SHE ASKED WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

?GG: it might be

FGA: What Were Her Demands

?GG: she said

?GG: that if i accepted her help

?GG: that i would have to make a promise

?GG: that whenever we left this place

?GG: and wherever we end up going

?GG: she had to come

PCG: HUH?

?GG: not just echidna but all the denizens

?GG: their palaces their consorts their lands...

?GG: everything

?GG: i have to bring them all with us
