GG: ok, my robot exploded

GG: now what smart guy!

CG: HOLY SHIT, IT'S HARLEY

CG: COMMUNICATING WITH ME OUT OF NOWHERE OF HER OWN VOLITION

CG: HOLD THAT THOUGHT WHILE I GO INFORM MY DISGRACE OF A CLOWN FRIEND ABOUT THIS TRUE REAL LIFE MIRACLE, IT MIGHT LIFT HIS SPIRITS

CG: I HAVE TO SPREAD THE WICKED WORD LIKE I'M MASSAGING SHITTY SPARKLEDUST AROUND MY NETHER REGIONS TO ASSUAGE A VICIOUS RASH

CG: IT'S LIKE I'M SEASONING A FUCKING STEAK HERE.

GG: i knew i would regret this

GG: talking to you is so terrible

GG: its making my headache worse

CG: OH YEAH, BECAUSE TALKING TO YOU HAS JUST BEEN ABSOLUTE EUPHORIA.

CG: DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HEADACHES.

CG: RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LUMBERJACK SPLITTING WOOD ON MY THINK PAN.

CG: HE'S GOT THE FOREARMS OF A CHOLERBEAR, A MOUNTAIN OF LOGS, AND NOTHING BUT FUCKING TIME.

GG: uuuugh shut uuuuup!

GG: will you just tell me what you wanted?

CG: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

CG: I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO CONTACT ME, NOT THAT I'M NOT TICKLED BY THE SURPRISE.

CG: LET'S CATCH UP. HOW IS EVERYTHING? HOW WAS YOUR DEATHNAP?? I CAN ONLY HOPE IT WAS AS REFRESHING AS MINE.

CG: WHAT'S THAT? HOW AM I? I'M GREAT, FEEL LIKE A MILLION BOONBANKS EVER SINCE MY LITTLE POWER SNOOZE.

CG: STILL PRETTY TIRED THOUGH. YOU LOOK A LITTLE DROWSY YOURSELF. BUT WE WON'T BE GOING BACK TO SLEEP ANY TIME SOON, WILL WE JADE?

CG: NO WAY. A PAIR OF FEISTY GOGETTERS LIKE YOU AND ME, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR DREAMS OF HORRORTERRORS FONDLING EVERY RECESS OF OUR NAKED PSYCHES, PLEASANT THOUGH THEY ARE.

CG: YOU HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT USELESS SCAMPERING AND GIGGLING TO DO. WHEREAS I HAVE A CRUCIAL DATE WITH A PNEUMATIC DRILL, TO BORE A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF MY FOREHEAD, DEEP INTO THE PLUMP ANGUISH BLADDER WHICH STORES MY ALIEN DISMAY FLUID. THAT'S A REAL THING WE HAVE, FYI.

CG: I WILL THEN PERFORM A LITTLE SOFT SHOE NUMBER IN THE PUDDLE OF FLUID THAT ACCUMULATES ON THE FLOOR, WHILE MAKING THE BIGGEST SMILE EVER ATTEMPTED BY SOMEONE NOT CLINICALLY RETARDED.

CG: I WILL DO THIS FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT, JADE. TO SAY THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

GG: i cant believe i fell for this

GG: it was just a setup to troll me some more

GG: why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it

CG: TRY TO BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE

CG: TROLLING IS AN ACTIVITY THAT SHARES A NAME WITH MY ENTIRE SPECIES

CG: DO I GET ON YOUR CASE FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE HUMANNING YOU DO?

GG: thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word

GG: and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!

GG: you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont

CG: TELL ME JADE

CG: WHY ARE YOU SUCH A RACIST?

GG: aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!

CG: YES, EXACTLY.

CG: I AM A TROLL. IT SEEMS WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

GG: i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me

GG: and that is really really shitty!!!!!!

GG: i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever

GG: bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!

CG: WAIT

CG: OK LOOK

CG: I SERIOUSLY, HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

CG: YOU SAY YOUR ROBOT BLEW UP, AND THAT WAS SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO MESSAGE ME?

GG: yes

GG: as if my day needed another reason to get worse

CG: YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T CONTACT THE RIGHT ME.

GG: what does that mean!

CG: I MEAN FUTURE ME IS PROBABLY THE ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS.

CG: SINCE IT'S ALL NEWS TO ME.

GG: is this another prank

GG: you are seriously the worst at pranks

CG: I DON'T PLAY PRANKS, THAT'S JUVENILE NONSENSE.

CG: I DO TWO THINGS AND TWO THINGS ONLY, I DEVASTATE SORRY MOTHERFUCKERS, AND GET SHIT DONE AS AN AWESOME LEADER.

CG: IN THIS CASE, I AM ACCOMPLISHING THE LATTER.

CG: HERE, CLICK THIS AND WE WILL SOLVE THE MYSTERY TOGETHER.
