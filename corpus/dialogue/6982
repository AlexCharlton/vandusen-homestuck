UU: miss lalonde, do be carefUl.

UU: i can see that yoU are preoccUpied with aggressors at the moment.

UU: bUt yoUr viewport is beginning to black oUt more freqUently.

UU: i wanted to talk to yoU one last time before yoU enter, and yoUr whole session blacks oUt for good.

UU: if the effects are wearing off, it coUld explain the increase in viewport blackoUts.

UU: and once they wear off completely, perhaps that is why yoUr entire session goes dark on yoUr entry.

TG: that is an interesting theory that has like

TG: mostly no usefull bearing on anything probably?
