GT: Jane are you there?

GT: I wouldnt blame you for not answering since i was such a shitty boor to you last time.

GT: I just wanted to formally say happy birthday.

GT: And also to pass along a birthday present.

GT: I doubt it will make up for all the ways ive hurt your feelings but maybe it will be a start?

GT: Its some fancy juju thingamabob that calliopes bro gave to me.

GT: He specifically gave it to me to make me better so i could get stronger and punch him in the snout some day or something?

GT: I dunno about that. I dont think i care about becoming a great hero and challenging a weird grumpy alien all that much.

GT: Not nearly as much as my friendship with you.

GT: So i want you to have it instead.

GT: Just use the code to make it. The code is...

GT: Um...

GT: ORBROBuRBROS?

GT: No wait.

GT: Thats way too long...

GT: uBORBuBROS?

GT: How many letters were codes supposed to have?

GT: Fuck.

GT: BROBuROBuT

GT: ORuBuBROBOS

GT: No. Uh...

GT: BROBRO... something?

GT: Wait no there were definitely some little u's in it...

GT: Shit. I really should have copied it down before i closed the chat window.

GT: OuROBOuRBON

GT: BuRBORuBROS...

GT: Wow those arent even close.

GT: Hang on let me think.
