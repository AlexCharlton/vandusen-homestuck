TG: and here i thought i was actually over that

TG: but the second im given the slightest justification to drink again i say fuck it

TG: so it turns out i didnt stop wanting to like i told myself

TG: but that i still wanted to while pretending i didnt per some bogus tough girl act

TG: like i thought i was better than the problem

TG: or more like i thought i was too cool and too strong to admit it was actually really hard
