    <span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That boorish cur!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, that's exactly the phrase I would use to describe someone responsible for the extermination of five billion people.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was just so uncivilized of him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How could such an atrocity be allowed to happen?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Was his personal magnetism really that overwhelming?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe overwhelming in the wrong direction, yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it didn't happen overnight. It was a gradual decline in the integrity of the system that allowed it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Eventually the wheels came off and the political scene mirrored the absurdity of the media circus.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: By the time Presidents Jay and Dope were elected, western civilization had officially fucked itself over forever, and I think everyone knew it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When does that happen?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: 2024. The last free election the world would ever see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: They were on the ticket together? As president and vice president?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They were both president.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They were the first Dual-Presidents of the United States of America. Also the last.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They were also the first and last juggalo presidents. The founding fathers warned us about this, but nobody listened.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: They did? Warned us about what exactly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The Mirthful Executives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: George Washington had prophetic nightmares about them. He tried to warn people, and get language amended to the constitution to prevent it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like forbidding the election of what he famously described as &quot;a pair of salty bards,&quot; or &quot;unruly jesters given to the sweet drink.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But everyone just thought he toked too hard on the colonial cannabis or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not sure i follow. These are like clown presidents or such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. They were a shitty rap duo from your time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But they ran a hell of a campaign. By then the juggalo party had gotten huge. While the numerous other candidates split the moderate vote, they retained a very energized and devoted base.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You could say their party had a big tent.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk i really dislike the future you are describing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hey me too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They were swept into office on a wave of Faygo, and the presidential inauguration was the biggest Gathering of the Juggalos of all time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They all hosed each other down on the Whitehouse lawn with shitty soda. The &quot;D.C.&quot; in the capital thereafter officially stood for &quot;Dark Carnival.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Of course their campaign was helped considerably by having support from the Baroness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In retrospect, people developed the impression that it was all a part of her sick sense of humor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There was this sense that she just loved the idea of delegating the extreme subjugation of the world's population to a pair of demented clown rappers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Some have speculated this was just another way she was attempting to resurrect her previous model of governance, though this seems kinda far fetched to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Who the fuck ever heard of an alien juggalo? To me this is about as stupid as the crackpot theories get.</span>
