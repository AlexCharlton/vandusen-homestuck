CG: THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TIME I WILL EVER EXPLAIN ALL THIS STUFF TO YOU, BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WILL HELP MY HEADACHE MUCH TO REPEAT MYSELF.

CG: I BET IT'LL BE PRETTY FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IN THE PAST!

EB: i suppose it was...

EB: but meh, it is all water under the bridge.

EB: which is where trolls and their shenanigans belong!

CG: HA HA! I'M LAUGHING MY ASS OFF AT YOUR FUNNY FUCKING JOKE.

CG: I HOPE THIS IS THE CALIBER OF HUMOR I CAN EXPECT FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE-PAST, EGBERT.

CG: IT'LL BE A REAL TREAT TROLLING YOU WITH MORE OF THOSE NUB SLAPPERS TO LOOK FORWARD TO!

EB: oh, there will be lots of great material. just wait until i start handing out rabbits, you will love that.

CG: WOW, WHAT A CRYPTIC STATEMENT.

CG: CHECK THIS OUT, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

CG: ANYWAY, GUESS I'LL GET GOING AND LET YOU DIE IN YOUR FIRE, WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD, BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO FOR SOME REASON.

CG: I'VE GOT TO REWIND THE TAPE ON THIS CLUSTERFUCK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.

EB: yeah, i should get going too.

EB: my friend is pestering me, and i doubt she likes to be kept waiting.

EB: (she is sort of the bossy type!)

CG: WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO WITH ME.

EB: ummm...

EB: yeah, you're right, it is probably of no significance to you whatsoever.

EB: (hehehehe)
