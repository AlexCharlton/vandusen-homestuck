<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.</span>
