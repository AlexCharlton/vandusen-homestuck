GA: Hello

GT: hi...?

GA: Allow Me To Make This Simple

GA: I Am A Troll From Another Universe Using A Chat Client Utility Which Is Capable Of Contacting You And Your Friends At Any Point Of Your Lives Which I Choose Up To And Including The Moment Of Your Own Incompetence Fueled Self Destruction

GA: Im Looking For Evidence Of Intelligence In Your Species

GA: A Reason

GA: Any Reason At All Really

GA: To Justify Wasting The Few Precious Remaining Moments Of My Life On You

GA: It Has Fallen On Your Shoulders To Supply Me With That Reason John Human

GA: Go

GT: ha ha, what?

GA: What Indeed

GA: I Was Just Leaving

GT: so you're a time traveler?

GA: No

GA: We Dont Actually Travel Through

GA: Uh

GA: Well

GA: Not All Of Us Do

GA: One Of Us Does Though

GA: Thats Not What We Are Talking About Here And Is Aside From The Point

GT: so let me see if i have this straight...

GT: you are a time traveling space alien from the future, sent here to study humans?

GA: No

GT: are you from mars? is it a mission of peace?

GA: No John You Werent Listening

GT: what does your time machine look like? a phone booth? phone booths are a popular thing for some reason.

GA: Damn It

GT: were you lured to earth by a huge gyroscopey thing that jodie foster piloted in contact, while matthew mcconaughey sort of acted as her spiritual guide i guess...

GA: What The Hell

GT: and then he kind of preached to her about having faith instead of believing in the sciences so hard all the time, and i guess in the end she believed him, maybe?

GT: actually, im not even sure what the point of mcconaughey was in that movie. but he was still awesome.

GT: and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.

GT: and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.

GT: because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.

GT: anyway, does that have any applicability to your cosmic interstellar astrojourney?

GA: Okay Youre Even Dumber Than The Rose Human Thats Incredible Really

GT: pff, i know i'm dumber than rose, that is not much of a burn, dude!

GA: Im A Girl Not A Boy

GT: oh, sorry.

GT: i don't know why i thought you were.

GA: It Happens

GT: were you trolling rose too?

GT: TIME TRAVEL TROLLING???

GA: Yes As A Matter Of Fact

GT: oh boy, let me go put on my quantum space hat, and extra terrestrial adventure boots, and you can tell me all about it.

GA: If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement

GT: ha ha ha. i don't follow!

GA: I Just Spoke To Her In The Future

GA: Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression

GA: But Regardless She Said To Paste Something From Our Conversation

GA: To Get You To Understand Whats Going On

GA: I Have Strong Doubts It Will Be Effective But Here Goes

GA: GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works

GA: GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like

GA: TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.

GA: TT: you look kind of like... 

GA: TT: howie mandel from little monsters. 

GA: TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster. 

GA: TT: because he was a big goofy adult. 

GA: TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.

GA: GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest 

GA: TT: no, it's a movie. 

GA: TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is. 

GT: hahaha! oh man, you blew it!

GT: now i know for sure you're trolling me. rose hates that movie.

GA: Are You Suggesting

GA: I Was Being Trolled

GA: That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish

GT: possibly! i know that sure didn't sound like her.

GT: but i think it's more likely that you made it all up cause you know i like that movie.

GT: so i tip my cap to you, well played miss troll!

GA: Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well

GT: ok well, just between you and me...

GT: SOMEONE here is getting trolled.

GT: and it just might be all three of us.

GA: Okay

GT: but you shoulda told me you liked little monsters!

GT: we could jam about that. what was your favorite part?

GA: Suspicions Pitching Once Again Toward The Conclusion That You Are Just Very Stupid

GT: i really want to get a little monsters poster, but they're hard to find!

GT: i asked my dad for one for christmas. fingers crossed!

GA: Im Guessing Thats The Human Equivalent Of 12th Perigees Eve

GA: Will Your Adult Human Custodian Forage For Leavings As Ours Do

GT: yup, that sure keeps sounding alien of you.

GT: keep up the good work!

GT: listen, i'm kind of busy, i have to wrap this present and mail it in a hurry.

GT: so i'm going to block you!

GT: but i might unblock you again soon, because you're kinda cool.

GA: Your Blocks Mean Nothing But Dont Worry You Wont Hear From Me Again

GT: yeah well...

GT: you might just hear from me!

GT: also, you should give rose another chance.

GT: she is really great! whatever she did, she was probably just pulling her mind games on you, it's all in fun.

GT: there is more to her than that, you'll see.

GT: bye!
