CG: JOHN.

EB: karkat!

EB: what's up?

CG: I'M NOT SURE WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

CG: I GUESS IT'S JUST OUT OF A SENSE OF OBLIGATION AT THIS POINT.

CG: WE'VE COME THIS FAR

CG: SO I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD KNOW.

EB: know what?

CG: I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS ALIVE

CG: THIS MIGHT EVEN BE THE LAST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME.

CG: WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK AM I SAYING, THE LAST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME WILL BE THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME.

EB: uh...

CG: I MEAN THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

CG: BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I COULD BE DEAD SOON.

EB: oh no!

EB: are you in some sort of trouble?

EB: is it jack?

EB: karkat???

EB: what's going on?

CG: OH GOD THE HONKING

CG: WHY WON'T THE HONKING STOP

CG: I HAVE TO GO

CG: SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A DOUCHE TO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

CG: I HOPE YOU CAN SUCCEED AS A LEADER WHERE I FAILED MISERABLY.
