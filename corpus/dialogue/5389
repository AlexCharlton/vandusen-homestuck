TG: what is going on over here then

TG: is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what

AA: no this actually did happen

TG: i dont remember this

AA: thats because it isnt your memory

AA: this is alpha dave

AA: the one who chose not to take the nap which led to your death

TG: fuck

TG: lucky bastard

TG: so then i guess terezi tricked me

AA: did she

AA: didnt you ask for this

TG: it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah

TG: but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever

TG: is

TG: bro dead there

AA: evidently

TG: like in reality

TG: like thats a thing that really happened

TG: also

TG: is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too

AA: yes yes and yes

AA: yes it can be on the table and yes reality still means something

AA: and yes your guardian did die

TG: well

TG: dammit

TG: what did i do wrong

TG: aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible

AA: nothing

AA: all is well and as it should be

TG: whats he doing

TG: alpha me

AA: what would you be doing there if you were him

TG: i am him

AA: even better!

TG: i dunno

AA: would you be upset

TG: yeah

TG: sorta

AA: then maybe what you are doing is grieving

AA: in whatever way that comes naturally to you

TG: maybe

AA: you are lucky to be able to

AA: i could not for a long time

AA: but now that i can again im so relieved

AA: because i have discovered there is no reason to grieve!

TG: ok

TG: am i talking to someone there

AA: looks like it

TG: who

AA: who do you suspect you would be talking to in this situation

TG: probably

TG: terezi i guess

AA: maybe she is helping you through this

TG: i dunno

TG: would she do that

AA: you were helping her werent you

TG: was i

AA: i think so

AA: the living need each others help

AA: just like the dead do

AA: alpha dave still has a long way to go

AA: hes still not at ease with his mortality

AA: but people like us have to be!

AA: we have to be prepared to die a thousand deaths before our quest is complete

AA: the master we serve demands it

TG: so

TG: im just one dead dave offered up to the time god

AA: pretty much

TG: what about the other dead daves

AA: they come here too

AA: in their own bubbles

AA: you may cross paths with them if you wish

TG: uh

TG: i think

TG: im up to my neck in dave already

TG: just being one

AA: ha

AA: i know the feeling :)

TG: still doesnt seem right though

TG: why are you even here like why are you showing me this

AA: im not showing you im just visiting your bubble

AA: it projects your thoughts and memories

AA: as well as other things relevant to you much like the clouds do in skaia

TG: but like

TG: if im seeing this

TG: shouldnt i be able to do something about it

TG: or stop it from happening or

TG: i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends

TG: what do i do

AA: nothing

AA: none of this is your business anymore

AA: its time to move on
