EB: it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now.

GG: thats good!!

EB: oh but, like...

EB: i don't think i am actually saving the world here. :(

EB: i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that.

GG: hmm well i think whatever it is it must be pretty important!

GG: dont lose hope john i think it will all turn out for the best if you stay positive....

GG: just keep listening to your grandmothers advice!!!

EB: yeah, you're probably right.

EB: but, um...

EB: i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?

GG: oh uhhh.......

GG: i dont know didnt you???

EB: hmm, i dunno, maybe you talked to rose or dave about it or something.

GG: yeah maybe that was it!!

EB: they're really weird when they talk to me about you, like they're always trying convince me you have some spooky powers, but i'm always like no she seems like a pretty regular girl to me!

GG: heheheh :D

EB: but then when i think back maybe there are times when it seems like you know some things?

EB: like maybe you know more about a thing than you are telling me? i dunno.

GG: oh well john
