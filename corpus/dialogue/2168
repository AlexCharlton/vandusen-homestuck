TT: You seem a bit tentative.

EB: i'm fine i guess.

EB: since i got here i feel compelled to do these weird things i don't really want to do.

TT: Perhaps the early symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like post-traumatic stress?

EB: yeah, maybe. who knows!

TT: We should hurry. My laptop battery won't last forever.

EB: Ok. I will go back inside.
