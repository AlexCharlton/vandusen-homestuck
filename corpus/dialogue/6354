    <span style="color: #f2a400">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> began bothering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span> at 1:43
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should probably warn you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yet another exploding game trap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She already sent it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's weird.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She was probably just trying to protect me from the Batterwitch's latest assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sheesh, I can't believe you all finally got me saying &quot;Batterwitch&quot; too. Who would have thought?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's weird because Lalonde was the one who rigged it to explode.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's a bogus copy she coded herself. The real game file she downloaded is totally legit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What? Really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Got it right here myself. Checked it out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: File's fuckin' clean as a whistle. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A whistle that overcame a major substance abuse problem. Trying to get its life back on track.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The whistle is holding down a steady job now. It's taking things one day at a time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Eat a fuckin' dinner off that whistle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok I'll shut up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why would she do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To accomplish exactly what it sounds like got accomplished.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You narrowly averting the &quot;fake&quot; threat to your life, then getting your shit all hot and bothered at the Baroness over it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then you abdicate your heiress throne or something, and give up on this game as a big fuck you to the genocidal cake alien.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If she felt so strongly that I shouldn't play, she could have told me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or, told me more forcefully, I guess. I would have listened!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's working through some problems right now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Really doesn't want us to play that game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So I guess this was the insane stunt she whipped up to derail the inevitable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kinda reckless for my tastes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One of the above statements is a fucking lie, are you gutsy enough a gumshoe to spot it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe she was justified in taking such an extreme measure. I sure hadn't been taking her seriously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She even warned me not to play it until she got back, but I went ahead anyway because I was too impatient!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Now that I think about it, she was probably going to disarm it or such when she got back, seeing as her objective had essentially been accomplished already by an ACTUAL assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: After that, I told her I would believe her about everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That probably made her feel guilty about setting me up, so she told me not to touch the file until she returned.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sounds about right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But then I went ahead and ran it anyway like a doofus.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think she just wanted to be believed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Shucks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Am I an awful friend?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm not so sure about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, before you go taking a massive sad crap all over your friendship credentials, consider this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Only she could manage to blow up your computer with a nasty deathloop virus and somehow make YOU be the one to feel shitty about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Heh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or maybe you're the one who uniquely fills the predicate in that construction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't god damn know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your friendship with her is a half drunken three-legged relay race, and the baton is a stick of dynamite.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you two are the only ones on the track. Me and English are watching from under the bleachers, high-fiving constantly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess that's a pretty apt metaphor, even though it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just wanted to start playing the game so badly!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Now more than ever. I have reason to believe the stakes have increased dramatically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And they will continue to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think our dream counterparts are all marked for death, and if we are to stand a chance, we must move quickly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I agree.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just heard about your assassination on Prospit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, she told you already?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Who, RL? No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I read it in a newspaper.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you being ironic again?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I just picked up one of the sleazy Dersite tabloid rags.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes they'll feature some pretty entertaining gossip about the royalty or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But they're primarily dedicated to smearing Prospit. The press had a field day with the deaths of the Page and the Maid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dersite? You mean the other planet? The evil one?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Derse, yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not evil, necessarily. That's a bit simplistic. The kingdom represents the forces of opposition to Prospit and the four heroes. Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What did the story say about me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: &quot;DEAD&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Was the big ass headline.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then a photo of your dead body lying there, followed by a lot of bullshit slander.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was also reported your tower exploded. They couldn't find the body to give it a proper funeral. Probably incinerated.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I didn't realize you had woken up in the game already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: When did that happen?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dunno. Years ago. Don't really recall.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I shouldn't act surprised you didn't tell me. What with all your highfalutin secrecy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's hard to explain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I was never technically asleep there. I was awake without realizing it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then I realized it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I sorta learned how to be awake there while awake here too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I am awake there now, albeit pretending to sleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Pretending? Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For one thing, it gets a bit distracting managing two alert bodies in different places at the same time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And for another thing, it's better to maintain appearances.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Everyone on Derse believes their heroes haven't woken yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though they are both rumored to be very active sleep walkers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is half true. She can't ever seem to sleep still. Goes off wandering for days.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes I've gotta go round her up from some godforsaken cranny of the abyss. Drag her tipsy ass home, tuck her back in.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe I'll chain her leg to the bed if she doesn't wake up soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though in light of the recent assassinations, her slumbering attraction to the void probably works to her advantage. No one ever knows where she is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm still not sure I'm following.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why are you maintaining the appearance of being asleep? On Prospit, it seemed as if the people there regarded me and Jake very highly. Like celebrated figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is it not the same way on Derse?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's essentially the same situation here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They glorify us the same way. Almost like we're their purple pajama'd team mascots. Even though they will completely oppose our objective when all is said and done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kinda ridiculous, really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But even so, I think it's better to lay low, not alert anyone to my...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Alertness. <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/pcstrider.gif" border="0" /></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That way I can sneak around and gather information. Do some reconnaissance before shit starts getting real.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: In other words, read newspapers, get a feel for &quot;the word on the street,&quot; and such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: As might a detective? :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, among other things. Like keep an eye on agent activity.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You mean... secret agents??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, more like high ranking officials.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Judging from your knife wound, I'm betting you were the victim of the Archagent himself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You should feel honored, I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who's that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A guy named Noir.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Real nasty dude. Crazy ambitious. Loves knives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If we're going to stand any chance of winning this thing,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I've got this nagging suspicion we're gonna have to take him down first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And a feeling that nags equally,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Is it ain't gonna be easy.</span>
