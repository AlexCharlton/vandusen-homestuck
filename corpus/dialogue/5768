CG: SHE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE.

EB: really??

CG: THAT'S THE RULE, JOHN. YOU KISS A DEAD PLAYER IN TIME, AND THEIR DREAM SELF TAKES OVER, ASSUMING THEY STILL HAVE ONE.

EB: oh, wow.

CG: IT'S INCREDIBLE YOU REACHED GOD TIER STATUS WITHOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE MORE MUNDANE MEANS OF RESURRECTION AVAILABLE.

CG: WAIT, YOUR UNFAILING CLUELESSNESS MAKES IT THE OPPOSITE OF INCREDIBLE, MY MISTAKE.

EB: so, i guess...

EB: it would not have worked on my dad then?

EB: or rose's mom... :(

CG: NO, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO PICTURE HAPPENING BEHIND THE BLACK CURTAIN, JOHN.

CG: YOU SNOGGING UP YOUR DEAD HATTED MAN LUSUS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MENTAL IMAGE.

CG: OR ROSE'S ADULT WOMAN LUSUS. MAYBE A DEAD WOMAN SWEEPS YOUR SENIOR IS MORE YOUR CUP OF SAUCE, SINCE APPARENTLY YOU ARE "NOT A HOMOSEXUAL", WHATEVER THAT EVEN MEANS, NOT EVEN TO SPEAK OF YOUR RACE'S ABSURD QUALMS WITH THE NOTION OF INCEST, WHICH AGAIN, STILL SORT OF WONDERING HOW THAT CAN EVEN BE A THING.

EB: er...

CG: IS THAT YOUR GAME, EGBERT. HAVE YOU HAD YOUR EYE ON MADAME LALONDE, AND YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CONVENIENT RESURRECTION OPPORTUNITY TO BUST OUT YOUR MOST PASSIONATE SMOOCHMOTIFS KEPT IN RESERVE? AND IN FRONT OF HER DEAD FEMALE "OFFSPRING" NO LESS! JUST SHAMEFUL.

EB: well...

EB: she is a very pretty lady, but that seems like a really inappropriate thing to think about, karkat.

CG: YOU DON'T SAY!

CG: WHAT ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE

EB: i don't know!

EB: i am frankly pretty upset about finding them dead in the magic castle, and i guess i was wondering aloud if something could have been done.

EB: or at least maybe to talk about it, without angry tirades being involved.

CG: EXACTLY, YOU WERE EMBARKING DOWN TRAGEDY LANE, AND WE'VE GOT TO STAMP THAT GARBAGE OUT.

CG: WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GETTING ALL MOROSE WHILE WE'VE GOT SO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE.

CG: FUCK, LOADED PHRASE, FORGET I SAID THAT.

CG: JUST CLAM YOUR SHIT UP AND FORGET YOUR STUPID GUARDIAN, LIKE I DID WITH MY DEAR CRAB MONSTER CUSTODIAN, WHO I ADORED IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER.

EB: you are being a douche!!!

EB: wait, what am i saying, you are always a douche, hehe.

CG: YES, THANK YOU.

EB: heheheheh, your dad was a crab monster?

CG: SHUT THE FUCK UP.

CG: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

CG: ROSE, REMEMBER.

EB: yes.

CG: SHE IS WAITING ON DERSE FOR YOUR BOMB TO BE DELIVERED.

CG: IT WILL ARRIVE SAFELY, A LITTLE LATER.

EB: oh, great!

EB: how do you know it gets there?

CG: JADE TOLD ME.
