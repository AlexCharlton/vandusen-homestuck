<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: really??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT'S THE RULE, JOHN. YOU KISS A DEAD PLAYER IN TIME, AND THEIR DREAM SELF TAKES OVER, ASSUMING THEY STILL HAVE ONE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, wow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S INCREDIBLE YOU REACHED GOD TIER STATUS WITHOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE MORE MUNDANE MEANS OF RESURRECTION AVAILABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WAIT, YOUR UNFAILING CLUELESSNESS MAKES IT THE OPPOSITE OF INCREDIBLE, MY MISTAKE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so, i guess...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it would not have worked on my dad then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: or rose's mom... :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: NO, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO PICTURE HAPPENING BEHIND THE BLACK CURTAIN, JOHN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU SNOGGING UP YOUR DEAD HATTED MAN LUSUS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MENTAL IMAGE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OR ROSE'S ADULT WOMAN LUSUS. MAYBE A DEAD WOMAN SWEEPS YOUR SENIOR IS MORE YOUR CUP OF SAUCE, SINCE APPARENTLY YOU ARE &quot;NOT A HOMOSEXUAL&quot;, WHATEVER THAT EVEN MEANS, NOT EVEN TO SPEAK OF YOUR RACE'S ABSURD QUALMS WITH THE NOTION OF INCEST, WHICH AGAIN, STILL SORT OF WONDERING HOW THAT CAN EVEN BE A THING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: er...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IS THAT YOUR GAME, EGBERT. HAVE YOU HAD YOUR EYE ON MADAME LALONDE, AND YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CONVENIENT RESURRECTION OPPORTUNITY TO BUST OUT YOUR MOST PASSIONATE SMOOCHMOTIFS KEPT IN RESERVE? AND IN FRONT OF HER DEAD FEMALE &quot;OFFSPRING&quot; NO LESS! JUST SHAMEFUL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she is a very pretty lady, but that seems like a really inappropriate thing to think about, karkat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU DON'T SAY!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't know!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i am frankly pretty upset about finding them dead in the magic castle, and i guess i was wondering aloud if something could have been done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: or at least maybe to talk about it, without angry tirades being involved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: EXACTLY, YOU WERE EMBARKING DOWN TRAGEDY LANE, AND WE'VE GOT TO STAMP THAT GARBAGE OUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GETTING ALL MOROSE WHILE WE'VE GOT SO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: FUCK, LOADED PHRASE, FORGET I SAID THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JUST CLAM YOUR SHIT UP AND FORGET YOUR STUPID GUARDIAN, LIKE I DID WITH MY DEAR CRAB MONSTER CUSTODIAN, WHO I ADORED IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you are being a douche!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wait, what am i saying, you are always a douche, hehe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YES, THANK YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: heheheheh, your dad was a crab monster?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHUT THE FUCK UP.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE IS WAITING ON DERSE FOR YOUR BOMB TO BE DELIVERED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT WILL ARRIVE SAFELY, A LITTLE LATER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, great!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how do you know it gets there?</span>
