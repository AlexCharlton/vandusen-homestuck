TT: You mean a canard of behemothic embellishment?

TG: what

TT: Or was your resolve finally dismantled by the siren's song of all that flame broiled beef?

TG: no no

TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods

TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers

TT: I'll limit my establishments of reference to lumber mills and sugar shanties from now on.

TT: Also, there's a Burger King less than forty minutes from my house. I won't let this stand in the way of the new policy though.

TG: there is

TG: ok whatever

TG: im talking about a dream i just had

TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking

TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper

TT: Certainly less delicious.

TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on

TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties

TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno

TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation

TG: are you busy

TT: Yes.

TG: cool listen to this
