    <span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes But This Isnt All There Is To The Cloning Process</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: A True Paradox Clone Is An Exact Genetic Duplicate Of The Subject</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Later That Clone Will Be Sent Back In Time To Become Itself</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In Fact If It Is An Exact Duplicate This Is Guaranteed To Happen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: This Is What Classifies It As A Paradox Clone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Any Duplicate Which Genetically Deviates From The Original Is Not</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Is Simply A Mutant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And For Breeding Purposes Mutation Is Desirable</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Within Reason</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You May Adjust The Settings On The Equipment To Promote Genetic Anomalies</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Its Very Delicate And You Can Go Too Far</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Responsibly Guiding The Evolution Of The Genetic Code During The Breeding Process Is Very Important</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In Fact It Is The Most Important Thing About This Of All</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: huh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Actually</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats Exactly What Youre Doing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Your Objective Is To Breed The Genesis Frog</span>
