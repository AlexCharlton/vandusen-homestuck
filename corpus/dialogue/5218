GA: Yes But This Isnt All There Is To The Cloning Process

GA: A True Paradox Clone Is An Exact Genetic Duplicate Of The Subject

GA: Later That Clone Will Be Sent Back In Time To Become Itself

GA: In Fact If It Is An Exact Duplicate This Is Guaranteed To Happen

GA: This Is What Classifies It As A Paradox Clone

GA: Any Duplicate Which Genetically Deviates From The Original Is Not

GA: It Is Simply A Mutant

GA: And For Breeding Purposes Mutation Is Desirable

GA: Within Reason

GA: You May Adjust The Settings On The Equipment To Promote Genetic Anomalies

GA: But Its Very Delicate And You Can Go Too Far

GA: Responsibly Guiding The Evolution Of The Genetic Code During The Breeding Process Is Very Important

GA: In Fact It Is The Most Important Thing About This Of All

GG: it is?

GA: Yes

GG: huh...

GG: so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?

GG: am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?

GG: sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O

GA: Actually

GA: Yes

GA: Thats Exactly What Youre Doing

GG: oh!

GA: Your Objective Is To Breed The Genesis Frog
