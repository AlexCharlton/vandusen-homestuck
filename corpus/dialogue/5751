AG: Let me guess, even after all my lessons, you allowed yourself to get sucker sta88ed, right? Pretty lame!

AG: I mean, lucky for you it was lame. I guess 8eing lame pays off when dying a hero's what gets you killed.

AG: If our Hero of 8reath reached god tier, he would have 8een completely indestructi8le! Lol.

AG: Damn, I forgot, I was going to stop ripping on that guy, since he got sta88ed through the chest and died. Haha, whoops.

AG: Anyway, I figure you're pro8a8ly safe from a just death too, since I'm pretty sure you haven't done anything all that despica8le.

AG: Yet. ::::)
