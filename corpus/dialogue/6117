GG: I of course immediately wanted to tell you all about, but it was still well before sunrise for you, and you were surely still asleep.

GG: Then as the day went on I guess I became distracted by other things. You know how it is.

GG: I hope I'm not too late to "warn" you, though to be frank I don't have the foggiest clue what it is I'm warning you about.

GG: "Dear Jake, oh please do try not to... have already... died in my dream? Likely while you were sleeping, perhaps peacefully?"

GT: Haha yeah. I see your point.

GG: Still, I think you'll agree that it's to be viewed as a troubling omen.

GG: I care very much for you, and I don't know what I'd do if I lost you both in my dreams, and here in this world.

GG: So for whatever good it does, just please be extra careful out there today!

GT: Roger that janey!

GT: And um same goes for you about being careful what with these various rogues accosting you with foul play lately and whatnot...

GT: Because well i sure do care a lot about you too you know that.

GG: Hooray! Will do. ;B

GG: Now let's get this silly old adventure off to the races before the coat of dust it's growing gets any thicker.

GT: Booyeah!

GT: Ok good luck jane and keep me posted! C ya.
