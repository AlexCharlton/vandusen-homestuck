GG: But where is she?

GG: Hah, her drink is still there. So she can't have gone far.

TT: Oh snap.

GG: I don't see her anywhere in the rest of the house.

GG: I see plenty of plush wizards and window gizmos, and... pumpkins? Really, Roxy?

GG: What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?

TT: You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.

GG: I just tried messaging her. But no response.

TT: I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.

TT: Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.

TT: Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.

GG: She said things were on fire when we last talked?

GG: Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.

GG: But judging by the view from her window, it looks lovely outside.

GG: What exactly is the danger I am saving her from here?

TT: Zoom out.

TT: Way out.
