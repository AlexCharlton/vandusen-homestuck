<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: might have some choice years left of the pinpot noir</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't doubt the choiceness of those pinpots, but I'm not really here to screw around.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: There's something important to talk about.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: WHAT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wait really</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I've been crunching numbers all day on this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The percentage of probability is simultaneously bananas and through the roof.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: A complete disgrace of tropical fruit erupting from the peak of an unassuming domicile.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ohhhh my</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: how do u know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I've aggregated thousands of subtle clues indiscernible to primitive human neurology and rammed them through my determinative infatuation engine at the astonishing speed of information.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And also because I'm pretty sure it's what I would do if I were him, which is literally the case.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And also.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because he kind of told me I guess?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: lol the poor guy is tortally under siege from all sides hehe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He knows well enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I've badgered him with enough &quot;insincere&quot; solicitations to paint a pretty striking portrait of my cognitive progenitor's inclinations, even if he wasn't able to pick up on such hints from the man himself, which strikes me as statistically implausible. And that's not even me just spewing more ironic AI bullshit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i was never that clear on that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: r u like</span>
