GG: but why, what does it do?

GG: its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out

CG: I'M NOT GOING TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT.

CG: BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO SCREW WITH.

CG: THERE ARE OUTCOMES THAT ARE EVEN WORSE THAN THE COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF EXISTENCE ITSELF

CG: FORCES MORE DAMAGING TO THE INTEGRITY OF REALITY THAN THOSE CAPABLE OF TURNING IMAGINATION INTO PURE VOID

CG: THEY ARE FORCES WHICH IF HANDLED RECKLESSLY WILL NULLIFY THE BASIC ABILITY OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN ALL REAL AND HYPOTHETICAL PLANES OF EXISTENCE TO GIVE A SHIT.

GG: i dont think im following...

CG: YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW

CG: ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TURN THE THING OFF

CG: AND THEN DO THE NEXT THING I WAS TOLD TO TELL YOU TO DO.

GG: you were told?

GG: by who?

CG: BY YOU.

GG: oh...

GG: future me?

CG: YES.

CG: YOU COULD BE TELLING YOURSELF THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE'RE SORT OF WORKING ON A STRICT NO MEMO POLICY.

CG: WHICH IS YOUR IDEA OF COURSE.

CG: DID I MENTION HOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE ARGUE WITH OUR PAST/FUTURE SELVES? YES, PRETTY SURE I DID.

CG: SO I'M GOING ALONG WITH THE POLICY AS BEST I CAN.

CG: I AM BEING PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE, AND I WILL GENTLY LOWER A MAGNIFICENT, CORUSCATING COLUMN OF HOT FUCK YOU DOWN THE PROTEIN CHUTE OF ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE.

GG: uh... ok

GG: well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me!

CG: YOU DON'T SAY.

CG: SO ANYWAY, BECAUSE OF THAT, MY ROLE AT THE MOMENT IS TO ACT AS A SORT OF GO BETWEEN FOR YOU AND YOUR FUTURE SELF

CG: TO HELP ALONG THE PROCESS OF MAKING THESE PLANS

CG: WHILE YOUR FUTURE SELF IS DELIBERATELY VAGUE ABOUT SOME STUFF SO AS NOT TO "JINX" THE CONCEPTION OF THE IDEAS IN THE FIRST PLACE I GUESS?

CG: ALL WHILE YOUR CURRENT SELF IS NECESSARILY KIND OF DUMB ABOUT EVERYTHING.

GG: hey!!!

CG: SORRY, OK, JUST KIND OF IGNORANT

CG: BECAUSE STUFF HASN'T HAPPENED YET

CG: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

CG: IT'S NOT ALL THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR ME EITHER, BUT I'M USED TO THIS SORT OF IDIOCY BY NOW.

CG: IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THE MORONIC REVERSE CONVERSATION WITH EGBERT I TRAPPED MYSELF INTO.

CG: MEANWHILE TIME IS KIND OF RUNNING OUT HERE, WHERE I AM

CG: WE'RE COUNTING DOWN TO SOMETHING

CG: SOMETHING LOOMING ON THE TROLLIAN TIMELINE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS

CG: AND MY TEAM IS KIND OF FALLING APART

CG: I'M COMPLETELY LOSING TRACK OF EVERYONE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

CG: SO AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING ALONG WITH WHATEVER THERE IS TO GO ALONG WITH.

CG: AND THAT IS YOU AND YOUR CRAZY FUTURE PLANS.

CG: AND THE SCRATCH.

GG: oh yeah! dave told me about that.

GG: what is it?

CG: I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!

CG: AT ONE POINT I THOUGHT I DID, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST WHATEVER SENT JACK HERE.

CG: BUT CLEARLY IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

CG: ARADIA KNEW BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY, AND THEN SHE WENT AND GODDAMN EXPLODED.

CG: YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME EITHER, BECAUSE I'M NOT "SUPPOSED TO KNOW" YET.

CG: WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN CARE, LET'S JUST DO IT.

GG: ok then...

GG: what was the thing i told you to tell me to do?

GG: right now, i mean

CG: OK, DON'T ASK ME WHY, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

CG: BUT THAT BLUE SCREEN THERE

CG: FIRST, LIKE I SAID, SHUT IT OFF

GG: ok

GG: then what

CG: THEN YOU NEED TO DRAW IT.

GG: draw it?

CG: YES

GG: and then?

CG: THEN NOTHING

CG: THAT'S IT.
