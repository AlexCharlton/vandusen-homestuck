GG: uhhhhhhhhh...

GG: please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like!

GA: What Does It Sound Like

GG: it sounds like

GG: it involves

GG: a lot of breeding :\

GA: Well It Does

GA: But Not Breeding Through Means Typical Of Most Species

GG: oh

GG: does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it?

GA: It Has A Lot To Do With It

GA: It Is Cloning Equipment Much Like What Is Scattered All Over The Veil

GA: The Same Kind Responsible For Creating All Of Us

GG: ok then, thats pretty neat

GA: I Didnt Mean To Alarm You By Implying You Were Required To Wage A Great Deal Of Personal Procreation Over A Span Of Several Weeks

GG: yeah, whew <_<;

GA: Though It Should Be Clear That Repopulation Is Among Our Duties As Well In The Long Term

GA: And Ive Gathered That The Cloning Apparatus In The Veil Is Probably Meant To Permit An Initial Boost On The World We Select For Settlement

GA: But Beyond That It Is Up To The Descendants To Perpetuate The Race

GA: And Your Species Has Quite An Advantage In This Respect

GG: how so?

GA: Your Procreation May Be Carried Out By Paired Individuals Autonomously

GA: Whereas Ours May Not

GA: Which Is What Makes My Role Particularly Important

GG: what is your role?

GA: Im The Keeper Of The Matriorb

GA: It Is An Egg That Will Hatch A New Mother Grub

GA: She Alone Will Be Responsible For Bearing Our Young

GG: whoa, cool!

GG: so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns

GA: I Guess So

GA: And You Are Like Erect Livestock

GA: Without The Muscle Definition

GA: Or The Hermaphroditic Physiology For That Matter

GG: :o

GA: But Milk Producers Nonetheless

GA: That Rare Kind Of Organism To Nurture Hatchless Young Within

GA: Are You Not

GG: errr.......

GG: yes 8|
