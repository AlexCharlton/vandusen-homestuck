    <span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but it sounds like we dont have much to pull this off</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: because foes are a comin?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: who are all these foes you say we gotta beat</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: those who i mentioned my brother has been exploiting as his pawns from afar.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the most obvioUs woUld be the one responsible for the extinction of yoUr race.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and who also happened to be responsible for this most fortUitoUs nap.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU don't remember yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a party</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a sad jane</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a poor sad jane with shitty fella problems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and a ruined cake! it was going 2 be so delish, but no</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it was claimed by the cruel and unforgiving sands of lopan</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: gcat</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: GCAT!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: god DAMMIT gcat!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: he poofed me away with cat magic and i got ko'd by a floor</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt which floor?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: it was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a derse floor?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: aw man</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: was i captured?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the batterwitch has me doesnt she</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: THATS who you meant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what is she gonna do with me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as i said, she is his servant, and is obligated to do everything in her power to facilitate the cycle of his existence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and while nearly all she has done on earth and on derse has been to advance that scheme, that does not mean she's withoUt her own agenda.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know that she woUld like to see my brother defeated as mUch as anyone else. for her enslavement, for doUble-crossing her, and for orchestrating her people's extinction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he always did loathe trolls. i've sUspected i may be to blame for their misfortUne as well, considering he knew how mUch i fancied them. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok so if she wants him dead too and has her own personal secret plans or whatever then whats she want with me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believe she's looking ahead, beyond the fUlfillment of her obligation. she is likely making plans for after she is liberated. she has lived as a rUler and conqUerer for very long time, and probably coUldn't have done so withoUt sUch gUile and foresight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if she has captUred yoU, it's certainly for a good reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think she wishes to exploit yoUr abilities as a rogUe of void.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: pfahahaha</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: WHAT abilities</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont have any abilities</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: except making screens dark which as superpowers go is lame as hell</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: none that yoU have gotten in toUch with yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt rest assUred, yoU have them!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's like i told yoU before, remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a fUlly realized rogUe of void can do remarkable things. things which even other god tiers woUld view as miracUloUs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: why don't yoU see what it is the qUeen woUld have yoU do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: then yoU may look inside and determine whether yoU have it in yoU to do it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: man</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whatever she wants</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: even if it IS an enemy of my enemy kind of thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i dont think i could ever bring myself to help her :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is Understandable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUst do whatever yoU feel is right. i'm sUre yoU will make the correct decision.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU see, i trUst yoU too, roxy. ^u^</span>
