TG: because foes are a comin?

TG: who are all these foes you say we gotta beat

UU: those who i mentioned my brother has been exploiting as his pawns from afar.

UU: the most obvioUs woUld be the one responsible for the extinction of yoUr race.

UU: and who also happened to be responsible for this most fortUitoUs nap.

TG: huh?

TG: wait

TG: how DID i fall asleep?

UU: yoU don't remember yet?

TG: i remember

TG: a party

TG: and

TG: a sad jane

TG: a poor sad jane with shitty fella problems

TG: and a ruined cake! it was going 2 be so delish, but no

TG: it was claimed by the cruel and unforgiving sands of lopan

UU: ...

TG: i remember

TG: gcat

TG: GCAT!!!!!

TG: god DAMMIT gcat!

TG: he poofed me away with cat magic and i got ko'd by a floor

UU: bUt which floor?

TG: it was

TG: a derse floor?

TG: aw man

TG: was i captured?

TG: the batterwitch has me doesnt she

TG: THATS who you meant

TG: what is she gonna do with me?

UU: as i said, she is his servant, and is obligated to do everything in her power to facilitate the cycle of his existence.

UU: and while nearly all she has done on earth and on derse has been to advance that scheme, that does not mean she's withoUt her own agenda.

UU: i know that she woUld like to see my brother defeated as mUch as anyone else. for her enslavement, for doUble-crossing her, and for orchestrating her people's extinction.

UU: he always did loathe trolls. i've sUspected i may be to blame for their misfortUne as well, considering he knew how mUch i fancied them. u_u

TG: ok so if she wants him dead too and has her own personal secret plans or whatever then whats she want with me

UU: i believe she's looking ahead, beyond the fUlfillment of her obligation. she is likely making plans for after she is liberated. she has lived as a rUler and conqUerer for very long time, and probably coUldn't have done so withoUt sUch gUile and foresight.

UU: if she has captUred yoU, it's certainly for a good reason.

UU: i think she wishes to exploit yoUr abilities as a rogUe of void.

TG: pfahahaha

TG: WHAT abilities

TG: i dont have any abilities

TG: except making screens dark which as superpowers go is lame as hell

UU: none that yoU have gotten in toUch with yet.

UU: bUt rest assUred, yoU have them!

UU: it's like i told yoU before, remember?

UU: a fUlly realized rogUe of void can do remarkable things. things which even other god tiers woUld view as miracUloUs.

TG: like what?

UU: why don't yoU see what it is the qUeen woUld have yoU do?

UU: then yoU may look inside and determine whether yoU have it in yoU to do it.

TG: man

TG: whatever she wants

TG: even if it IS an enemy of my enemy kind of thing

TG: i dont think i could ever bring myself to help her :(

UU: that is Understandable.

UU: jUst do whatever yoU feel is right. i'm sUre yoU will make the correct decision.

UU: yoU see, i trUst yoU too, roxy. ^u^

TG: daw thanx callie

UU: oh no...
