<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: and she was on earth visiting your town or something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: beyond that, it's a little confusing!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: i don't think i have ever actually liked a girl before in that way, so i am not really sure what i am supposed to feel or do...</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ARE YOU QUITE DONE SLOGGING THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL MORASS OF ADOLESCENCE, EMERGING FROM THE SLUDGE IN YOUR JUNIOR ECTOBIOLOGY WADERS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ARE WE FEELING JUST A LITTLE BIT WISER? DID WE GROW TODAY? THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YOU WOULD THINK WARNING YOU GUYS THAT FRATERNIZING WITH THESE FEMALES IS PUTTING YOUR LIVES IN DANGER WOULD BE ENOUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: REALLY, DANGER YOU SAY? OH GOODNESS, WE NEARLY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE! WHY THANK YOU, MR. TROLL, HOW GRACIOUS OF YOU TO ALERT US TO OUR FOOLISHNESS.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: OF COURSE NOT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: is that how it went down</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: YES, YOU FIGURED IT OUT! YOU ARE A SAVANT OF XENOBIOLOGY DAVE AND I SALUTE YOU WITH ONE OF MY MANY INTERGALACTIC SPACE TENDRILS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: (THAT'S FAKE, I MADE THAT UP TO FUCK WITH YOU)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: or maybe it was a guy who rejected you</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: I SEE NOTHING BUT A COWARD BEHIND DARK EYEWEAR CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR WOMEN AND A PAIR OF IMPUDENT LIPS PURSED SO TIGHT IT'LL SOUND LIKE AIR SQUEALING OUT OF A BALLOON WHEN I PUNCH YOU IN THE GUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: ok youre clearly gay and youve probably got some issues about it dude</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: uh oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: JOHN DON'T LISTEN TO THIS FUCKER, HE'S THE WORST GUY AT GIVING ADVICE I'VE EVER SEEN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: yeah, i dunno dave, i have talked to karkat a lot and i really don't think he has a thing for me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: EXACTLY. JOHN ONCE AGAIN IS FLYING HIGH AS SMARTEST HUMAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND JOHN, PURELY HYPOTHETICALLY, IF ONE OF US IN THE FUTURE DOES MAKE SOME SORT OF SOLICITATION YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: BECAUSE OF PERHAPS SOME CULTURAL DIFFERENCES</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: I MEAN NO ONE IN PARTICULAR HERE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: MAYBE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT PERSON MIGHT NOT BE THINKING TOO CLEARLY AT THAT MOMENT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">CEB: uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT THIS PERSON HAS GOTTEN TOO WRAPPED UP IN A SORT OF CALIGINOUS IDEAL</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND GET CARRIED AWAY, POSSIBLY SO MUCH SO THEY WERE BLIND TO HOW COMPLETELY FUCKED UP AND WEIRD IT WOULD BE TO PURSUE ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITH ANOTHER SPECIES</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: ESPECIALLY ONE THAT DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF A CALIGINIOUS RELATIONSHIP</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: the fuck</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">CTG: are you talking about</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: BUT I'M NOT THAT PERSON. I HAVE A FIRM GRASP ON HOW DERANGED AND UNNATURAL ANY SORT OF INTERSPECIES RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE, WHETHER CALIGINOUS OR CONCUPISCENT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: SO I ASK</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: NO I'M FUCKING BEGGING YOU BOTH</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: IS TO HAVE THIS RENDEZVOUS INSTANTLY DETERIORATE INTO A LOT OF REVOLTING TROLL/HUMAN SLOPPY MAKEOUTS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: THAT WOULD JUST RUIN IT FOR ME, OK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">?CG: REALLY THE ONLY SCENARIO THAT I AM SURE WOULD CAUSE ME TO REGRET SUCCESS. GOT IT?</span>
