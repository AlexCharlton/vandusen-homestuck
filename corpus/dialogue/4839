CG: JACK.

CG: I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED.

CG: BUT ON PROSPIT, I SAW HIM UP CLOSE, WITHOUT ALL THAT RIDICULOUS GREEN SHIT OBSCURING HIM.

CG: I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT WAS REALLY HIM BY THE WAY HE LOOKED, BUT I JUST KNEW.

CG: HE WAS WEARING A RING I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE, CERTAINLY NOT ONE BELONGING TO OUR QUEENS.

CG: WE DESTROYED THOSE.

CG: HE WORE IT ON HIS ONE HAND, WHICH WAS COVERED IN OUR MUTANT BLOOD.

CG: AND THEN

CG: JUST LIKE THAT

CG: HE KILLED ME

CG: AND I GUESS

CG: EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY JUST HIS WAY OF SAYING HI

CG: I STILL FELT KIND OF BETRAYED.

EB: betrayed?

CG: YES JOHN. BETRAYED.

EB: um, ok.
