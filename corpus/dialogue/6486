<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *zuip*</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess i cant help but wonder if that truly is the way she sees me or if it is just some wild ego stroking delusion on my part.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I always get this sense that people sorta fancy me but who knows i could be just miles off the old rocker about that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre right i think its high time we cleared the air on some things even if there is a chance it gets all awkward and prickly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That is what being brave and adventurous is all about after all. It isnt just about summoning the courage to pilfer some priceless loot from trap laden catacomb. Or shooting at stuff with two guns at once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There are treacheries of the heart to consider!!!</span>
