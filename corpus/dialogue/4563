AG: Yes, and 8esides. Continuing on this path and 8ringing Jade into the game I think you will agree is very important!

AG: And not just 8ecause she is your friend and you would 8e kind of upset if she died.

AG: Again.

EB: yes, i think i would be.

EB: but why else?

AG: 8ecause you need to complete your prototyping chain!

AG: Only when all players have entered with a prototyped kernel does the 8attlefield assume its final form.

AG: That form prepares Skaia to grow the new universe you will cre8te.

AG: Or in this case, fail to cre8te. 8ut whatever!

AG: That is no reason to deter you from completing worthwhile game o8jectives.

EB: we are supposed to create a universe?

AG: Yeah! You didn't realize that yet?

EB: no!

AG: 8oy. How clueless can you get.

EB: why are we supposed to do that?

AG: What a stupid question! It is the point of the game. It's what happens when you win, and winning is the only point of anything.

EB: oh. that's true, i guess.

AG: Anyway, you should 8e glad it's the point. And you should 8e glad your predecessors were not such a sad sack group of players like you guys.

AG: Otherwise your universe would not exist, seeing as we cre8ted it 8y 8eing incredi8le in every way.

EB: you did?

AG: Yep. You're welcome. ::::D

EB: hmm...

EB: i don't know what to think about that.

AG: Not knowing what to think a8out things appears to 8e your specialty!

EB: hurrrrr oh man what a burn!

EB: (j/k it was actually lame.)

AG: ::::P

EB: well to be honest, i never really believed any of your guys's doom and gloom nonsense.

EB: not because i think you are lying...

EB: i just feel like there must still be a way to win!

AG: That's the spirit, John!

AG: That is a winner's attitude, and there is always hope for someone who has that.

EB: yes, i agree.

EB: also, there is always hope for someone who has good friends to count on!

AG: Pff.

AG: Laaaaaaaame.
