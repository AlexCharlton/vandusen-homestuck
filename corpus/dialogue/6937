TT: Hold up.

TT: Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.

GG: Really?

TT: Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.

TT: Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.

TT: Particularly for Roxy and Dirk.

GG: What is it?

TT: They are probably going to die if they don't join the game very soon.

GG: Shucks!!!!!

TT: Hey, I'm upset about it too, but let's watch the fucking language.

GG: Ok, what do I do?

TT: Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades when we established our connection.

GG: Upgrades? What upgrades?

GG: Wait, is that how this stupid "Delirious Biznasty" application got on here?

TT: No comment.

TT: Install and run the server.

TT: You will be connecting with Roxy. I will have Jake connect with Dirk. Setting up the chain like this will be important.

GG: Why?

TT: It seems that I again have no comment.

GG: Sheesh.

GG: Very well then, Mister Zipperlips.

TT: I don't have lips. You just said something laughably illogical.

TT: How typical of someone who isn't a fashion accessory of immeasurable intelligence.

GG: Whatever! Let's curtail the horseplay this once while I help Roxy.

GG: Ok. I installed it. Now what? Should I run it?

TT: Yes. That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client she's running.

GG: Okey dokey. Doing that now.

GG: Hey, I can see her room! :B
