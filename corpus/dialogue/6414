TG: ill promoise not to use my wicked void powers re: basic common sense + skills of deduction to bust you up so bad

UU: i'd be ever so gratefUl. :u

TG: then w.o givin you the whole 3rd degree

TG: what is safe to tell me?

TG: like what does it mean to be a rogue of void

TG: thats what i am rite

UU: yes! i can tell yoU plenty aboUt that.

UU: a rogUe is a passive class. yoU see, there are passive (+) and active (-) classes. some more strongly passive or active than others.

UU: the +/- distinction can mean many things, bUt coUld be qUite roUghly sUmmed Up in this way: active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves, while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others.

UU: bUt of coUrse there's plenty more to it, and that rUle is in no way absolUte. only a starting point for Understanding the dichotomy.

TG: you mean kinda like

TG: offensive vs defesive magic in an rpg

UU: sUre!

UU: that's another fine way of looking at it.

UU: classes always come in +/- pairs, with significant disparity between them.

UU: while a rogUe is passive, a thief woUld be its far more active coUnterpart.

UU: the rogUe and thief classes tend to be assigned to females. not exclUsively, bUt commonly!

UU: other classes lean more toward male assignment, while others are exclUsively male, and jUst as many are exclUsively female. like my class. ^u^

UU: that's a bit of a tangent thoUgh. to answer yoUr qUestion aboUt being a rogUe, i shoUld tell yoU both classes in +/- pairs tend to have very similar descriptions.

UU: in this case, a rogUe or a thief is "one who steals." qUite simple, really!

UU: bUt whether the class is + or - makes all the difference. it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make Use of the aspect.

TG: so basically

TG: a thief is like the asshole class

TG: the player who says step off shits mine suckas

TG: whereas

TG: a rogue

TG: is bascially robin hood

UU: if that reference to yoUr cUltUre provides a sUitable comparison, then absolUtely. :U

TG: so im essantially the robin hood of void

TG: im still not sure

TG: wtf that actually means

UU: Understandable.

TG: i guess robin hods p cool tho

TG: thiefin up loot from peeps who got too much

TG: then all sugardaddyin it out 2 the needy like a boss

TG: just dont have a clue how that works with void

UU: yes, it is one of the more conceptUally nebUloUs pairings, i agree.

UU: and i can't say i know a smashing good deal aboUt the natUre of the void player's path, since the aspect is by definition inscrUtable to those it does not choose.

UU: bUt i can at least tell yoU this.

UU: if yoU are ever to enjoy fUll ascension as a rogUe of void, yoU will be able to do some completely astonishing things!

TG: like what

UU: oh no, yoU will not pry this oUt of me.

UU: not to preserve caUsality, bUt to keep the sUrprise in store for yoU.

UU: it woUld not be honoUrable of me to spoil the discovery, shoUld yoU be fortUnate enoUgh to realize yoUr potential.

TG: well

TG: about that

TG: i feel sorta stupid about this but

TG: ive been giving all my friends this whole dramagic spiel about not wanting to even play this thing

TG: and i might of fucked stuff up already

UU: is that so?

TG: its so

TG: and i guess i still havnt decide what to do

TG: there are props and cons 2 both things

UU: woUld yoU mind listing them?

TG: ok either i dont play

TG: and i get this kinda passive aggressive revange at the witch for killing my mom

TG: and thereafter keep staying here and being lonely

TG: or

TG: i do play and the spoips r as follows...

TG: sweet powers 4 me

TG: check

TG: tri generational lolonde family reonion

TG: check as fuck

TG: meet all my friends

TG: HECKACHECK

TG: and smoe others stuff

UU: all fine points.

UU: is there nothing i can do to make the decision easier?

TG: nah but thx

TG: u already have anyway

TG: i will probably play

TG: wonder if i can tell distri withoup lookin like a waffle assed chump

UU: what's a waffle arsed chUmp?

UU: is it earth cUisine? :u~

TG: lol no its just a shithead

TG: this doesnt matter now tho i cant play til i go deliver this dead cat back ing time to maybe my mom or someshing??/

UU: that's another statement that doesn't make a good deal of sense to me, bUt if it is important to yoU, then godspeed!

UU: i'm so pleased to hear yoU are leaning in favor of participating with the rest of Us. i promise we'll all have a ball together.

UU: now i have a bUsy schedUle to keep Up with so i mUst go. bUt please remember yoU can always contact me if yoU have qUestions.

UU: don't be a stranger, love. ta! ^u^
