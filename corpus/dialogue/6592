CCG: OH BULLSHIT.

FCG: LIKE FUCK IT'S BULLSHIT.

FCG: IT'S ALL TOO CLEAR TO ME NOW. IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF QUADRANT VACILLATION, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

FCG: NO WONDER SHE WAS FRUSTRATED AND GOT FED UP WITH YOU.

CCG: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

FCG: IS IT?? TELL ME, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TREATED HER IN A WAY THAT COULD BE OBJECTIVELY CONSTRUED AS A FORM OF BLACK SOLICITATION?

CCG: THAT'S JUST

CCG: NO, THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS ROLLED TOGETHER. IT'S LIKE

CCG: SPIRITED PLATONIC CONTENTION.

CCG: TOTALLY NORMAL TERRITORY IN A HEALTHY MATESPRITSHIP.

FCG: YEAH, A *HEALTHY* ONE, NOT ONE INVOLVING A DEMENTED LOUDMOUTH WHO CAN'T KEEP HIS SHIT UNDER CONTROL.

FCG: LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MUCH OF THAT ANIMOSITY IS INNOCENT "PLATONIC RAGE"?

FCG: COULD IT BE THAT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU WANT TO PUSH THINGS WITH HER ONTO CALIGINOUS TURF, MAYBE SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT THERE?

FCG: SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR GRUB, AND CULL IT TOO??

FCG: THAT WAY YOU HAVE HER ALL TO YOURSELF!

CCG: FUCK YOU.

FCG: YOU WANT HER IN EVERY QUADRANT LIKE A DESPERATE FOOL.

FCG: DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE BECOME? YOU ARE THE SAD JOKE CHARACTER IN THE ROMCOM, YOU KNOW THE GUY I'M TALKING ABOUT.

FCG: WHO'S GREEDY AND INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT FILLING EVERY QUADRANT, TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO IT, AND IN THE END HAS FUCKALL TO SHOW FOR IT.

CCG: I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS.

FCG: YOU KIND OF DO, FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES.

CCG: NO, FUCK THAT, I'M SO DONE WITH YOU.

FCG: YEAH, YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE, BECAUSE THE TEN MINUTES ARE ABOUT UP, AND I'LL BE GONE.

FCG: THEN IT'LL JUST BE YOU AND THE OTHER GUY, SPINNING YOUR GLOBES TOGETHER LIKE A COUPLE STUPID PIECES OF SHIT, AD INFINITUM.
