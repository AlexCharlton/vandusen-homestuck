CG: OK THIS IS GOING TO SOUND PREPOSTEROUS GIVEN OUR LAST CONVERSATION.

CG: AND I GUESS PRACTICALLY EVERY CONVERSATION PRECEDING IT.

CG: AND I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DISGUSTING LIKE APOLOGIZE.

CG: AND EVEN THOUGH I'LL HATE MYSELF FOR IT I WILL TOTALLY MEAN IT, I PROMISE.

CG: LIKE, REALLY REALLY MEAN IT.

AG: You're going to ask me to join your team, aren't you.

CG: YEAH.

CG: HOW DID YOU KNOW.

AG: I don't seem to have much choice now! Aradia kicked me off the good team.

CG: HAHAHAHA WOW THAT IS GREAT.

CG: WAIT, SORRY.

CG: NO WAIT, I DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE NOW.

CG: I APOLOGIZE TO MYSELF FOR OFFERING YOU A SHITTY MEANINGLESS APOLOGY.

CG: APOLOGY ACCEPTED, KARKAT. LET'S BURY THE THRESHER WITH A TOTALLY PLATONIC BRO BULGE BUMP.

CG: BUMP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

AG: You dork.

AG: Do you really think your usual pedantic quips are going to 8ug me now????????

CG: I'M NOT TRYING TO BUG YOU I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO JOIN MY DAMN TEAM, NOW STEP IN LINE SERKET.

AG: I was just 8etrayed and a8andonded 8y my two accomplices and 8est pals, and on top of that I am soaked in the 8lood of my lusus which I just had to decapit8 myself.

AG: So listening to a cra88y asshole 8e all tickled with his own mediocre retorts isn't going to spoil my evening!

CG: OK, WELL, SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

CG: BUT I MEAN YOU CAN JUST DUMP HER CARCASS IN THE KERNEL AND BRING HER BACK STRONGER THAN EVER.

AG: Wow.

AG: Uh, good to know.

AG: I guess. ::::\

CG: NOW WHY DON'T YOU HOP IN THE TRAP, WASH THAT NASTY BLUE SHIT OFF, AND JOIN OUR FUCKING SESSION ALREADY.

AG: What! It's so rude to dict8 hygiene procedure to a lady. Under any circumstance! Even for douchey loudmouths with delusions of leadership.

AG: May8e you should try to think a8out the dum8 things that fall out of your protein chute for once, Vantas.

CG: BLAH BLAH BLAH.

CG: NOW MY CHUTE IS DOING A FUCKING STELLAR IMPRESSION OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

AG: Anyway, you know my 8lood's the prettiest and you'd o8viously kill to have it.

CG: NO IT SUCKS.

CG: TOTALLY HAPPY WITH MINE, NICE TRY THOUGH.

AG: 8S!

AG: Why would you hide 8ehind your lame gray anonymity then?

AG: You do realize everyone thinks that's totally lame, right????????

CG: IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

CG: I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BE A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD.

CG: I'M NOT GOING TO WEAR THAT SHIT ON MY SLEEVE LIKE YOU DO.

CG: LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.

CG: IT'S PRIVATE, SO EVERYONE CAN GO POINT THEIR PROBING BUSYBODY SNIFFNODES UP THEIR OWN IMPERTINENT SEED FLAPS.

AG: Fine. Like anyone really cares! It's just lame and insecure.

AG: So why don't you tell me what I've got to do here???????? I await instruction from my 8igshot a8looded leader.

CG: OK FIRST THING'S FIRST.

CG: YOU'VE GOT TO CONNECT WITH TAVROS QUICKLY AND GET HIM IN THE SESSION BEFORE HE GETS KILLED.

AG: Uggggggggh.

CG: WHAT.

AG: Can't someone else do that?

CG: NO. WHY.

AG: XXXXO

CG: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, JUST DO IT.

AG: 8ut I h8 that guy!

CG: WHO CARES.

AG: This is your command decision? Getting someone who h8s a guy to save his life? Pretty weak, 8oss!

CG: WHY DO YOU EVEN HATE HIM, IT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.

CG: IF ANYTHING YOU SHOULD PITY HIM.

CG: ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU WERE THE ONE WHO PARALYZED HIM.

AG: I know. I don't really understand it.

AG: It's just a really special kind of h8! It never goes away and it doesn't make a lot of sense.

CG: THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD TIME TO BE CONFIDING IN ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS OF BLACK ROMANCE BUT OK.

AG: Oh god, what?

CG: I MEAN IF YOU'RE REALLY IMPLYING TAVROS IS YOUR KISMESIS I THINK YOU'RE BRAYING UP THE WRONG FROND NUB.

CG: BOTH PARTIES HAVE TO HATE EACH OTHER EQUALLY, I MEAN LIKE TRUE HATE.

CG: MAYBE YOUR FEELINGS COME SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO FITTING THE BILL BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN HATE ANYONE, IT'S WEIRD, HE'S KIND OF BROKEN IN THE HEAD.

AG: Fuuuuuuuuck, WHAT are you talking a8out?

CG: I THINK THIS SUBJECT IS BEYOND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S GRASP BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT, NOBODY EVER REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT THOUGH.

AG: Whoa really? Oh no shit, REALLY????????

CG: OK, MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR LOBE STEM CAUTERIZED ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING THE TWO PRIMARY EMOTIONS, HATE AND PITY.

CG: PITY IS OF COURSE JUST THE TONED DOWN VERSION OF THE CENTRAL EMOTION, HATE.

CG: AND ALL THE NUANCES OF PITY MANIFEST AS VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF FEELINGS LIKE WHATEVER CHEMICAL REACTIONS TRIGGER MATING FONDESS OR THE MYSTERIOUS FORCES THAT ARE BEHIND MOIRALLEGIANCE.

AG: Karkat, holy fuck.

AG: So.

AG: 8oring.

CG: A WELL BALANCED PERSON IS IS GOING TO HAVE A GOOD DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN HATE AND THE VARIOUS PITY HUMORS.

CG: HAVING A GOOD BALANCE KEEPS ALL THE EMOTIONS SHARPER, SEE I THINK THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

AG: Oh????????

AG: I hope you know I already wore out some good note-taking pens today. All the pens.

AG: All of them.

CG: SEE, MY HATE IS LIKE A FINELY TUNED INSTRUMENT BECAUSE I'M AWARE OF THESE PRINCIPLES.

CG: I COULD HATE A HOLE IN PARADOX SPACE ITSELF, STRAIGHT THROUGH TO A NEW REALITY FRESH FOR THE HATING.

AG: Hahahahahahahaha, you don't even know how much I'm laughing at this.

CG: BUT SEE, YOU'RE TOO HEAVY ON THE HATE SIDE, OR AT LEAST YOU PRETEND TO BE WHICH IS MAYBE WORSE.

AG: You aren't reading anything I say are you? You just want to talk and talk and talk.

CG: AND YOU THINK YOU'RE HATING UP EVERYONE HARD WHEN YOU'RE REALLY JUST BURNING OUT THAT ENTIRE EMOTIONAL HEMISPHERE.

CG: IT'S LIKE LUKEWARM HATE. PRETENDER'S HATE, WITH NO COUNTERPOINT AT ALL.

CG: AS SUCH THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTANCE TO YOUR HATE, IT'S LIKE A CARDBOARD MOVIE PROP.

CG: WHICH IS WHY YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN, KIND OF LIKE TAVROS'S BUT ON THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE I GUESS.

CG: OR MAYBE YOUR BROKEN BRAIN LED TO THE IMBALANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, I DON'T KNOW.

CG: WHATEVER THE CASE IS, YOU'RE KIND OF EMOTIONALLY SCREWED, SORRY TO SAY.

CG: YOUR HATE'S TOO DULL FOR A PROPER KISMESIS, IN MY OPINION.

CG: AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO BE YOUR MOIRAIL HONESTLY, UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BOTHER PITYING YOU.

CG: AND LANDING A MATESPRIT? HAHAHAHA!

CG: SERIOUSLY, LIKE THAT WOULD EVEN INTEREST YOU.

CG: BASICALLY ANY FEATURE OF YOUR EMOTIONAL PROFILE THAT USUALLY MAKES SOMEONE VIABLE IN THE REDROM DEPARTMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FRIED.

CG: YOUR BLACKROM POTENTIAL'S PROBABLY TOAST TOO.

CG: HEY.

CG: ARE YOU THERE.

AG: Oh, yeah.

AG: I started tuning you out.

AG: Are you done?

CG: NO WAY, I COULD GO ON.

CG: THIS IS FASCINATING, TELL ME HOW THE FUCK THIS ISN'T FASCINATING.

AG: Did you learn this crap from your awful romance movies?

CG: THEY'RE REALLY INTRIGUING SOCIOLOGICALLY.

CG: INCREDIBLY COMPLEX, SOPHISTICATED STORIES, YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.

AG: Hey asshole, stop watching movies for girls.

CG: WHAT PART OF INTRIGUING SOCIOLOGICALLY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND.

CG: ALSO THEY'RE AWESOME, SHUT UP.

AG: Argh, ok! Man! Just let me connect to stupid 8oy-Dum8fuck so I don't have to listen to this anymore!

CG: YEAH OK.

CG: OH, WAIT!

CG: I NEVER EVEN GOT TO THE DAMN POINT.

AG: What is it now!

CG: I DIDN'T NEED YOU SPECIFICALLY TO CONNECT TO TAVROS, I MEAN I COULD GET ANY SCHLUB TO DO THAT.

CG: YOU JUST HAVE TO GET IN HERE ASAP BECAUSE I REALLY NEED YOUR MIND POWERS.

AG: You do????????

AG: I mean.

AG: O8viously you do. Duh.

AG: What for?

CG: I RAN INTO SOMEONE HERE.

CG: A SORT OF DOUBLE AGENT I GUESS.

CG: HIS NAME IS JACK.
