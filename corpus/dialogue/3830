CG: AN AGENT OF DERSE.

CG: WHO FLIPPED OUT AND ROSE TO POWER.

CG: HE KILLED YOUR BLACK QUEEN AND KING AND NOW HE'S IN CHARGE.

EB: so you didn't have him in your game?

CG: NO, WE DID.

CG: BUT HE WAS HARMLESS.

CG: ACTUALLY, HE WAS AN ALLY, SORT OF.

CG: HE SETTLED A GRUDGE AGAINST THE QUEEN BY HELPING US DETHRONE AND EXILE HER.

CG: AND THEN HE WOUND UP EXILED HIMSELF, AND SORT OF KEPT HELPING US THROUGH A COMMAND TERMINAL ON OUR OLD PLANET.

CG: HE'S KIND OF A HUGE ASSHOLE THOUGH.

CG: BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK THE QUEEN OUT OF THE PICTURE, WHEN WE GOT TO SKAIA WE ONLY HAD ONE MONARCH TO DEAL WITH INSTEAD OF TWO.

CG: OF COURSE IT WAS A NASTY GIANT 12X PROTOTYPED BLACK KING THAT TOOK FOREVER TO KILL, JUST BARELY IN TIME BEFORE THE BIGGEST METEORS CAME, BUT STILL.

EB: i see.

EB: so after he got exiled and all that, he came here into our game and caused all this trouble?

CG: NO, GOD.

CG: EGBERT YOU ARE THICKER THAN THAT HIDEOUS JOKE BOOK YOU WADDLE AROUND WITH.

CG: TRY TO THINK MORE ABSTRACTLY.

CG: THINK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES.

CG: WHAT'S AN EARTH GAME YOU LIKED TO PLAY?

CG: NAME ONE.

EB: ummmm...

EB: crash bandicoot?

CG: OK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S A REALLY LAME EXAMPLE, BUT THAT'S FINE, IT'S NOT THE POINT.

CG: SO LET'S SAY YOU PLAY YOUR BANDICOOT AND I PLAY MY BANDICOOT.

CG: THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BANDICOOT, SAME APPEARANCE AND DESIGN AND BEHAVIORS.

CG: BUT THEY ARE STILL COMPLETELY SEPARATE BANDICOOTS ON SEPARATE SCREENS.

CG: SO WE BOTH HAVE OUR OWN ASS BANDICOOTS TO OURSELVES, THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT.

CG: OUR JACKS ARE THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT TOO.

CG: SAME GUY, DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND OUTCOMES.

CG: OUR JACK TRUMPED THE QUEEN, BUT GOT NO FURTHER.

CG: YOUR JACK GOT THE BEST OF BOTH OF THEM, AND IS NOW SOMETHING HIGHER THAN A QUEEN OR A KING...

EB: like an ace?

CG: SURE OK.

EB: ok, i think i get it.

EB: but how did he do that? what was different about what we did versus what you did?

CG: FRANKLY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ORIGINAL THING THAT TIPPED THE SCALE WAS.

CG: IT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

CG: BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

CG: THE WORST IS YET TO COME.

CG: FOR YOU.

EB: oh no!

EB: what is the worst thing?

CG: ALREADY TOLD YOU.

EB: dammit!

EB: oh, hey...

EB: sorry, hold on, this little lady is bugging me about something.

CG: YEAH YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH AND GIVE HER THE LOUSY RABBIT ALREADY.

EB: oh!!!!!

EB: oh man, i just had THE BEST idea, this is so perfect.

EB: a blonde mother and daughter together, this is totally perfect.

CG: PERFECT FOR WHAT, FLEXING YOUR FORMIDABLE MENTAL HANDICAP LIKE A FUCKING HEAVYWEIGHT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES?

CG: OH WAIT, LET ME CHECK, THE ANSWER IS YES.

EB: it is like that scene in con air, i will give her the bunny like i am nick cage fresh out of the slammer.

CG: FUCK.

EB: i wish i had a filthy wifebeater on, oh well.

CG: JUST...

CG: AUGH.
