AT: wE ARE MAKING SOME STRICT PROGRESS ON THIS PUZZLE,

AG: Oh. That's cool I guess.

AT: sO WHERE DO YOU THINK, iS THE NEXT ONE,

AG: Um, I don't know? Pro8a8ly 8uried in the stupid sand somewhere like all the others.

AT: oKAY, THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT i WAS THINKING TOO, bUT,

AT: iT SUDDENLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU THINK THE PUZZLE IS COOL,

AG: The puzzle sucks! All these puzzles suck.

AG: If I have to help you put one more dum8 sla8 of 8oring rock into another stupid wall indent8tion I am going to put an indent8tion in my desk with my f8ce.

AT: bUT IT, uHH,

AT: iT LOOKS LIKE A FROG,

AT: aND THAT'S KIND OF FUN,

AG: Snore. These puzzles are for wigglers. I solved way 8etter puzzles than this in my heyday as Mindfang.

AG: Oh look some ruins. Oh look another mysterious recess in the wall! I wonder if something fits in there????????

AG: It pro8a8ly just opens a secret passage to more wall indent8tions. I am so over this puzzle.

AT: uHH, bUT,

AT: tHEY ARE NECESSARY TO SOLVE, aREN'T THEY,

AT: tO FIND NEW MAGIC ARTIFACTS AND THINGS, aND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE LORE OF THIS LAND,

AG: Tavros, let me let you in on a little secret a8out the lore of your land.

AG: It's 8oring!!!!!!!!

AT: }:o

AG: The minds of your consorts are very soft and impressiona8le.

AG: As easily manipul8ed as all those imps you've 8een 8ossing around.

AG: I have picked apart their tiny little lizard 8rains and seen through all the smoke and mirrors of their riddles.

AG: I have gotten to the truth they are guarding. The great 8ig mystery 8ehind this planet. And you know what it is, Tavros?

AT: nO,

AG: It's 8ullshit!

AG: Meaningless, 8oring, fanciful 8ullshit wrapped in flowery poems to keep you guessing.

AG: It all leads to one thing anyway, and that's what we should put our attention on.

AG: Real gamers cut to the chase. They power through all the nonsense and go for the gold.

AG: They cheat, Tavros.

AG: It is time you learned to start cheating.

AT: i THOUGHT, i KIND OF WAS CHEATING,

AT: bY MAKING FRIENDS WITH MONSTERS,

AG: Well, it's a good start. You are 8ending the rules and getting stuff done.

AG: Ok I will admit, I am fairly impressed with your progress so far. Even though you still pro8a8ly haven't even killed a single enemy!!!!!!!

AT: uMM,

AG: No, don't 8other. I know you haven't.

AG: 8ut may8e that's ok. May8e it's just your style, and your real strength is surrounding yourself with allies who are much stronger than you.

AG: Like me!

AG: I'm sure there is more than one way up the echeladder. In your case pro8a8ly the only way is to roll gently up the echeramp.

AG: The path of the invalid.

AT: yEAH, i AGREE,

AG: 8ut I think it's time to stop fucking around! You need to 8e challenged more.

AG: I have 8een designing a quest for you that should test your true limits.

AT: oHH,

AG: Yes.

AT: i MEAN, nOT THAT i DON'T,

AT: aPPRECIATE IT, BUT,

AT: dON'T YOU HAVE YOUR OWN QUEST TO DO,

AG: Yeah, well, after she got me in the game, Kanaya just left me in the lurch, pro8a8ly 8ecause she's dealing with her own crisis now.

AG: Which is just as well 8ecause I was starting to get nannied HARD. You wouldn't even 8elieve it.

AT: nANNIED,

AG: So I had some time to kill.

AG: I drew you a map!

AT: wHOAAA,

AG: Here, take a look.

AG: It marks what will 8e your new destination. Where you will find the ultim8 challenge.
