TT: Are you there?

-- tentacleTherapist [TT] is now an idle chum! --

EB: hey, yeah i'm here!

EB: and not dead i think.

TT: I know.

TT: I've been watching you scramble through the house like a lunatic.

TT: You should have answered me sooner.

EB: oh man, sorry, i was looking around for my dad and i can't find him anywhere!

EB: have you seen him?

TT: No. I'm sure he'll turn up.

TT: We have more important things to address right now.

EB: yeah, like where am i??

TT: I don't know that either. But I've determined your neighborhood was destroyed by the meteor. Wherever you were transported, it saved you from the impact.

TT: I've been reading reports in the news. Over the last few days, there have been many smaller meteor collisions with people's homes around the world.

TT: And they seem to be getting bigger. Yours was the biggest they've identified so far.

EB: wow, ok.

EB: so then i guess if this is all the game's doing, then the point is for us to save the world?

TT: Perhaps.

EB: then we'd better get moving and figure this game out!!!

TT: Yes, but wait.

TT: We should retrieve your PDA. Yet again.

TT: It will help to keep tabs on each other while you investigate.

TT: I think I can get you closer to it, if I can replenish our grist supply somewhat.

TT: There may be a way to recycle some that we already used.

EB: ok.

TT: I'll meet you out on the balcony.

EB: wait, rose! one thing...

TT: What?

EB: you never even wished me a happy birthday!

EB: um... hello?

TT: I was working on something to send you, but I was running late with it.

TT: I didn't want you to think I believed meager well wishes alone would suffice for the occasion.

TT: That said, happy birthday, John.

EB: haha, oh jeez, that is silly!

EB: anyway, thanks!
