EB: this is pretty comfy.

EB: why don't you just like,

EB: carry the bed around with me on it?

EB: up to the gate up there!

TT: I can't interact with you directly, or anything that you are touching, if it will result in moving you.

TT: See?

EB: oh.

EB: lame!

TT: The game probably regards that as a kind of cheating.

TT: In a way, thieving you of your free will as an adventurer, and the need to advance by your own skill and ingenuity.

TT: The server player is just a facilitator.

EB: well, ok.

EB: all that scurrying around kind of wore me out, i think i'm going to rest here for a bit.

EB: rose, can you keep the imps at bay? like, drop some stuff on them if they sneak too close.

TT: No, you should pick up your hammer and defend yourself.

EB: what, come on!

TT: I have no idea what the hell Dave is up to, or if he's any closer to recovering the game.

TT: There's some stuff I'd like to try, in case he doesn't come through.

EB: oh alright.

EB: i'm just gonna rest my eyes here a second though.
