<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmmm thats a hard question</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ok imagine a long tempting strand of yarn</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes! Oh yes so great.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; now imagine instead of being made of wiggly enticing stuff, its made of what lets you exist</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; and you are right at the twitching tip of it, dont you s33? look at the sky!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Meow yes i see the sky and can tell that indeed something is going on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But aside from that i dont really understand what you said being a cat and all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats fine, you dont have to try too hard</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; all you have to know is its the scratch and im not a hundred purrcent sure what happens next fur you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr i still think its nice how you slip cat things in the things you say youre so clever and wonderful nepeta!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; h33h33h33 :DD</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes of course!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; imagine that he is using this great big circle like a really fun scratching post, and it makes all this light come out that changes everything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; just after he starts doing that the sky goes funny everywhere and then i cant s33 you anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats what it is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I think i understand that completely!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; im a bit nervous for you, especially since you remind me so much of someone i already lost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but maybe youll be ok? i dont know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Im not worried nepeta so you shouldnt either its not as if i have never died before.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; you are a brave kitty, just like pounce was &lt;33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Pounce was a cat like me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; yes! she was amazing, i bet you and she would have gotten along famousely</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Ooh i bet youre right! Purr purr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Was she nice to sniff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; yes she smelled really good, and also, she was SUPER beautyifful.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Wow!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; did you ever have someone nice back on earth who you loved?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Rose!!!!! I loved rose. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; h33h33, of course you did. i mean a nice cat who was your matesprit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: There was a time i remember i was thinking about girl cats a lot for some reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I would saunter around the house making all these big meows and looking out the windows with my nose touching the glass.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then roses mom took me to this place where i was scared to be for a while and then when i was at home again i didnt do the meows anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I guess i didnt think about the girl cats after that which is just as well because none ever came to the windows really not even when i did my biggest meows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats too bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but i bet lots of girl cats would have loved to be with you, if only there had b33n some around to hear your lovely meows :33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Youre really nice to say so nepeta what about you though?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i have never told anybody this not even my moirail</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; heh, actually hes the LAST guy i might tell, he so wouldnt appurrve X33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but yes i have liked somebody for quite some time, but alas he doesnt know it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: What dont you tell him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Maybe you can win his affection by rubbing your cheek against him thats what i would do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ohhh no no no, im too shy even for that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; and he is so adorably grumpy all the time, it probably wouldnt go over well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; its hard to explain, maybe cats think diffurntly, but trolls tend to be pretty cautious about expressing their f33lings when it comes to the flushed quadrant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Whats a quadrant?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; it is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ummmmmmmm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; okay it has romantic applications but it is also something more general than that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; how do i say this!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is a thing in a group of things that consists of four similar things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Like paws?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; EXACTLY like paws!!! :DD</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I see thats really easy to get.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I think you should tell him that you like him you might not get the chance if you dont.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: For instance i think instead of meowing at windows i should have just scurried out a door before it could close!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Then i might have found a girl cat to sniff oh well. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i know, but its just not that simple. i could make someone else jealous i think, and what if he doesnt f33l the same way, and, urrgh, its so complickated</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; maybe i just n33d to let go of the silly infatuation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i think its never going to happen honestly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: You shouldnt lose hope!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I have another story that might give you hope even though it should be noted again that im only a cat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; oh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes one time i was with rose and i was sitting there dressed up in my suit with her as happy as can be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then she disappeared!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: The whole place disappeared and i was in another place. There was no rose there was someone else.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I guess i loved her too in time but never as much as rose it just wasnt the same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I kept waiting to see rose again but never did and finally i lost hope that i would and then i died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then i became alive again and i got to see her and i was so happy! Purr purr purr purr purr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Thats my story and thats why i think theres always hope even if you die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; so, youre saying that maybe i will have to die to get to be with him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes maybe. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i hope thats not the case!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but i guess you just have a different way of looking at things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thank you for the advice jaspers!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Purrrrr.</span>
