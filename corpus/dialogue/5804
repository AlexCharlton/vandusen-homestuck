TG: knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission

TG: god dammit

TG: that is so trite

TT: I really am sorry for that.

TG: its like

TG: heres how bad this is

TG: were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie

TG: you made this even more armageddon than it already was

TG: sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her

TT: If it's any consolation, Liv Tyler came with me on the suicide mission.

TG: the bunny or the actress

TT: Which would make you feel better?

TG: you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what

TT: If I could have chosen a method of sparing your life you might have found more awesome, I would.

TT: Is there an "ironic" way to do that?

TG: this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell

TT: Does it matter if I took some personal satisfaction seeing you fall unconscious at the gentle glance of a soft cotton globe?

TG: its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode

TT: ...

TG: so thats it

TG: im actually lying here on derse asleep

TG: and you went out there and blew up the sun

TG: and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost

TT: Yes to the first part.

TG: so youre not dead

TT: Not yet.

TG: then youre dreaming

TG: what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere

TT: Afraid not!

TT: I am wide awake.
