    <span style="color: #e00707">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> began pestering <span style="color: #00d5f2">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Shred it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: you HAVE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: the car.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Now shred it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Turn it into grist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I am not going to destroy my dad's car.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We need grist though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I can't get any building done without more.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Not to mention the fact that you're not going to be able to make any cool shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: There has to be a better way to gather up grist, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, I think there are supposed to be monsters here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I haven't seen any monsters yet, have you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, and I can't say I'm too disappointed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You should be though. Presumably they would drop grist and stuff when you kill them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like treasure. And food products that restore your health. Or at least make you less hungry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Haven't you ever played a video game, Jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Of course I have!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's cool. I haven't, since I am a pair of sunglasses, and communing with such simplistic software would be a trivial and hollow exercise for me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But I know loads of stuff about games. Like the fact that you gotta kill monsters if you want to make progress.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If not to snatch up the bitchin' loot, at least for the levels.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Levels?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How are you going to get better at fightin' without killing monsters, Jane.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think I've done a fair job of scaling my echeladder without resorting to the slaughter of innocent, fictional monsters, thank you very much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Please.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You've barely done any climbing at all. I'm talking about hopping more rungs than what playing a little prank on your dad or throwing your hat on the ground super hard is gonna get you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You need battle experience to make some real headway. Like Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm getting a little tired of various iterations of Dirk Strider telling me how I need to be more like Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I know you think Jake is neat. I know all the Dirks just ADORE Jake! I GET IT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Wow, chill out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This ain't about whatever stuff you're apparently fixin' to twist your shit in a pretzel over.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You just need to get stronger, is all. Don't you think that's what your dad would want?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You don't need to remind me about that. I'm suddenly having flashbacks to a few years ago when he would ambush me almost every day for a pointless round of strife.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Boy does getting swatted with brooms and having cakes shoved in your face get old fast.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, but in the process you got pretty handy with that fork/spoon thingy, didn't you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well. Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm just saying, if you don't run into any monsters on this planet, I think I'm going to have to set the bunny to &quot;sparring mode&quot; to help you along.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I am not going to spar with Lil Sebastian!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: He is too quick and deadly to fight with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And also, too adorable. :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Ok. We'll see about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But in the meantime, we need to figure out a way to start harvesting grist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Let's forget the car. But now that you have the wallet, you can grab much bigger things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Big things have got to be worth more grist than all the picayune bullshit you keep around the house.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: There are some choice relics in this place. Some of it has to be worth a fortune, gristways.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You could be right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I will give it a try.</span>
