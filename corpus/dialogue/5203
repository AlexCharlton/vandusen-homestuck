GA: Are You Feeling Any More Cooperative In This Timeframe

GG: password!

GA: I See No Of Course Not

GA: Please

GA: I Know You Were Talking To Her Shortly Before

GA: What Did You Say To Her

GG: I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!!

GA: Wow

GG: whoops sorry

GG: ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p

GA: I Still Dont Understand The Password Thing

GA: Past You Doesnt Care About Passwords What Happened

GG: well......

GG: it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation?

GA: Which Is Favorable

GG: both are!

GG: but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be

GG: so we can have one right now if you want

GG: in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already!

GG: but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........

GG: PASSWORD :P

GA: Can We Discuss A Serious Issue In A Silly Manner

GG: nope!

GA: How Am I Supposed To Know The Password

GG: because i told you

GA: I Dont Remember That

GG: exactly!!!!!!!!!!!

GA: I Feel Like I Am Trudging Waist Deep Through A Slither Basin Full Of Your Human Surprise Noodles

GG: hehehe

GG: yum :B ??????????????????????

GA: I Understand This Silliness Is Currently Permissible But Are Serious Questions About The Password Nonsense Permissible As Well

GG: hmm, i suppose those are acceptable

GA: Why Are You Demanding Passwords From Me And Also Apparently Karkat

GG: to keep the conversations linear!

GG: i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation

GG: you have to give me that password to start our next conversation

GG: this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now!

GA: I Am Not Trying To Do That

GG: i know, but trust me its better this way :)

GA: When Will I Get The Password

GG: i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from!

GG: but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation

GG: and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since!

GG: bye kanaya <3
