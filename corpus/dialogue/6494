GG: Get this shit out of my face.

TT: But you need it.

GG: Whatever.

TT: Is something wrong?

TT: What were you two talking about?

GG: I don't want to talk about it, and if I did, I sure wouldn't want to talk about it with you!

TT: Should I be offended, or apologetic right now?

TT: Help me out.

TT: You're talkin' to glasses here.

GG: I just want to go to sleep and not wake up forever.

TT: I think I'll just put this card over here on the desk.
