GA: I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From

GA: We Engineered That Incarnation

GA: He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create

GG: yes i got that!

GA: Sorry

GA: I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure

GG: you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?

GA: Yes Literally

GA: That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be

GA: I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons

GG: but your species is too!

GG: especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic

GA: Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks

GA: Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose

GG: but i dont do that!

GG: i try to say what i mean as much as i can

GA: Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That

GA: Its A Nice Change Of Pace

GG: from what?

GA: Oh Its Not Important

GG: haha, you mean from rose?

GA: Well

GA: Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation

GG: yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!

GG: they inculcate that stuff like crazy

GG: so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?

GA: Sort Of

GG: are you best friends now??

GA: I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be

GA: I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though

GG: why?

GG: oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?

GG: what the heck does that mean!

GA: It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her

GA: I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess

GA: She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent

GA: And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me

GG: yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!

GA: You Are More Sensible

GA: Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You

GA: Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit

GA: Like Me

GG: you did???????

GA: If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This

GG: yeah! :D

GA: I Woke Up A Long Time Ago

GA: I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young

GA: The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess

GA: My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help

GA: And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert

GA: Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White

GA: He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit

GA: Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since

GA: He Said He Was My Guardian

GA: And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That

GA: Then Later He Stopped Coming

GA: In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind

GA: Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It

GA: But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real

GA: He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party

GA: And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes

GA: It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy

GA: Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements

GG: jeez, i hope not...

GA: But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great

GA: I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me

GA: And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People

GG: me too!!!!!

GG: wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common

GA: Youre Right We Do

GA: I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role

GA: It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By

GA: To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It

GA: I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems

GG: well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature

GG: i can understand that

GG: are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?

GA: Yes Definitely

GA: We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems

GA: I Believe She Is Yours

GA: And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough

GA: She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned

GA: And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations

GG: you mean your guardian?

GA: Yes

GA: And Hes Not Merely A Guardian

GA: Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian

GA: Like Your Lusus Was

GG: uh oh...

GG: im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous

GA: I Feel The Same Way About It

GA: The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious

GA: Even When Seemingly Benign

GG: she didnt mention anything about this when we talked

GG: but then she seemed preoccupied

GA: She Was

GA: Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon

GA: After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me

GG: yeah, i will!

GA: In The Meantime I Will Go

GA: I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb

GA: It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now

GG: lol yeah i guess so!

GG: ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...

GG: theres still so much i want to know!

GG: i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!

GA: Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can

GA: The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together

GG: yes! <3

GA: Ill Message You Again In Your Future

GA: And You May Reply If You Have Cause To

GG: if i have cause to?

GG: oh!!!

GG: that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear

GA: Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords

GG: yeah! i guess someone told you?

GA: Yes You

GA: You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me

GG: aaaaa you see??????

GG: you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!

GG: i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...

GG: i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from

GA: Thats A Reasonable Attitude

GG: ok lets put the system in play starting now!

GG: i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again

GA: Okay

GG: the password is...............

GG: CROOOOOOOOOOOAK

GG: it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!

GA: Ten

GA: Im Counting Eleven

GG: whoops!

GG: eleven then :p

GA: The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality

GG: kanaya :o

GG: that sounded

GG: just a weeeeeee bit

GG: sarcastic ;D

GA: Oh

GA: Wow Yeah

GA: I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity

GG: you are just becoming multicultural, thats all

GG: i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well

GG: it mostly involves saying fuck a lot

GA: Oh No

GG: heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad

GA: Yeah I Know

GG: ok! go hatch that orb!

GG: i will be waiting

GA: Yes Ill Do That

GA: Bye Jade

GG: later!
