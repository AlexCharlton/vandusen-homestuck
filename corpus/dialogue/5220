    <span style="color: #4ac925">GG: really???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Engineered That Incarnation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes i got that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Literally</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but your species is too!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but i dont do that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i try to say what i mean as much as i can</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its A Nice Change Of Pace</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: from what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Oh Its Not Important</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: haha, you mean from rose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: they inculcate that stuff like crazy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Sort Of</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: are you best friends now??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what the heck does that mean!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Are More Sensible</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you did???????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah! :D</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Woke Up A Long Time Ago</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Said He Was My Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Then Later He Stopped Coming</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: jeez, i hope not...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: me too!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youre Right We Do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i can understand that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Definitely</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Believe She Is Yours</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you mean your guardian?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Hes Not Merely A Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like Your Lusus Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: uh oh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Feel The Same Way About It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Even When Seemingly Benign</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: she didnt mention anything about this when we talked</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but then she seemed preoccupied</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, i will!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In The Meantime I Will Go</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: lol yeah i guess so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: theres still so much i want to know!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes! &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ill Message You Again In Your Future</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And You May Reply If You Have Cause To</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: if i have cause to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah! i guess someone told you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes You</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: aaaaa you see??????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats A Reasonable Attitude</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok lets put the system in play starting now!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: the password is...............</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it mostly involves saying fuck a lot</span>
