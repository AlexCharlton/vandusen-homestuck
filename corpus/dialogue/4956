GG: you sound really confused to me!

AT: aBSOLUTELY, i AM CONFUSED LIKE A FOX,

AT: tHE KIND THAT HAS HIGH SELF ESTEEM,

GG: heheheh

GG: youre incredibly silly

GG: i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here!

AT: i UNDERSTAND THAT, aND JOKES HAPPEN, yES,

AT: bUT FEELING GREAT ABOUT YOURSELF IS NOT A JOKING ISSUE,

AT: iT IS HEAVY DUTY BUSINESS, aND NEEDS TO BE GIVEN ALL THE SERIOUSNESS THAT SAD THINGS GET,

AT: i'VE LEARNED THAT, fROM MY FRIENDS, AND ALSO, FROM RUFIO,

GG: rufio?

AT: yES, hE'S A FAKE,

GG: what do you mean fake?

AT: a FAKE GUY i MADE UP IMAGINARILY,

AT: hE NEVER STOPS BEING A THING THAT'S NOT REAL,

GG: ohh like an imaginary friend....

GG: heh, ok

AT: i'M PRETENDING THAT BEING FULLY HONEST ABOUT RUFIO'S FAKENESS, AND,

AT: bEING UP FRONT ABOUT HIS GENERAL FRAUDULENCE, tHAT IT WILL ONLY GIVE ME EXTRA CONFIDENCE,

AT: i'M PRETENDING THAT AS HARD AS i CAN, iN THE MOST CONFIDENT WAY,

AT: wHICH MAKES IT PARTIALLY MORE TRUE,

GG: that

GG: sure is a philosophy you have there!

AT: yES, bEING CONFIDENT IS ALWAYS ABOUT SAYING AND DOING THE THINGS YOU FEEL,

AT: eVEN IF THE AFRAID PART OF YOU SAYS, nO, pLEASE DON'T DO THAT,

AT: lIKE, uHHHHHHH,

AT: hERE IS A THING i'M AFRAID TO SAY TO YOU, jADE,

AT: bUT,

AT: i'M TOO CONFIDENT NOW TO LET MY AFRAIDNESS MAKE ME FEEL TERRIBLE,

GG: oh??

GG: well, what is it?

AT: rEMEMBER, i TALKED TO YOU A LOT WHEN YOU WERE SLEEPING,

GG: yes

AT: uHH, aND,

AT: wE TALKED ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS, aND WE HAD SOME THINGS IN COMMON, aND IT WAS NICE,

GG: sure!

AT: aND i THINK CONSEQUENTLY, tHE EMOTIONAL RESULT IS PROBABLY,

AT: tHAT MAYBE i HAVE SOME POSSIBLE RED FEELINGS FOR YOU,

GG: red feelings?

GG: you mean

GG: whoooooaaaaaa

GG: wait

GG: really? :o

AT: wOW, tHAT SURE WAS A HARD THING TO SAY AND MADE ME INCREDIBLY NERVOUS,

AT: bUT i SAID IT BECAUSE OF MY REMARKABLE LEG-POWERED SELF CONFIDENCE,

AT: aND NOW i THINK ALL THAT'S LEFT IS DEFINITELY YOUR RECIPROCATION ABOUT THAT, pROBABLY,

GG: um.................

GG: well

GG: i dont think i can reciprocate!

AT: uH OH,

GG: i mean

GG: youre nice

GG: but i dont really know you...

GG: i dont even know your name!

AT: oH GOSH, hOW STUPID CAN i BE,

AT: i FORGOT TO SAY,

AT: i'M TAVROS,

GG: ok tavros

GG: i dont know if youve fully thought about this!

GG: you dont actually know me very well either

AT: oH YES, i SURELY DO,

AT: bECAUSE WE HAD A NUMBER OF SPIRITED CONVERSATIONS, wHEREIN YOU WERE VERY NICE AND PLEASED TO SPEAK WITH ME,

AT: dID,

AT: i MISINTERPRET THAT, wAS IT NOT ACTUALLY NICENESS,

GG: well no

GG: i was being nice

GG: because

GG: i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me

GG: but......

GG: things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations!

GG: i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming...

GG: i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real

GG: dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit?

AT: uH,

AT: kIND OF,

GG: sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you...

GG: but i dont know what else to say

AT: bUT WHAT ABOUT,

AT: mY ATTRACTIVE BRAVADO,

AT: aND IGNORING MY INSTINCTUAL COWARDICE HARD ENOUGH TO SAY THAT i LIKE YOU,

AT: iSN'T THAT,

AT: sUPPOSED TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE, aND ENCOURAGE THE MAJOR HAVING OF FLUSHED FEELINGS IN OTHERS,

AT: i GUESS WHAT i MEAN IS, wHAT ABOUT ALL MY CONFIDENCE,

AT: wHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT,

GG: jeeeeeez, um...

GG: tavros i am really flattered you like me and all

GG: and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut...

GG: i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess?

AT: wOW,

AT: oK,

GG: i aaaalso think...

GG: and really this is just polite friendly advice!

GG: that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time

GG: it...

GG: oh man im sorry to say

GG: it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose!

GG: and all things considered i think we should just stay friends

GG: or really........

GG: continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well!

AT: yEAH,

AT: uUUUUUUHHH,

GG: sorry :C

AT: nO, nO, iF i'M BEING REALISTIC i THINK THAT'S WHAT'S REASONABLE TO SAY TO ME,

AT: aND i'LL WORK ON TONING DOWN MY SELF RESPECT A LITTLE,

GG: aaaah no! you should have self respect

GG: just...

GG: oh boy this is frustrating

GG: can we talk about this later?

GG: i have some things to do!

GG: why dont we get back to the original point

GG: why do you want to commune with bec again?
