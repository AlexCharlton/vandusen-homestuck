TT: But you have to promise to stay put.

TT: Don't try to stop me. Just let it go.

TG: but this was my mission

TT: It really makes no sense for you to go. This was never your preoccupation.

TT: They selected me a long time ago.

TG: that doesnt make sense

TG: why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me

TG: theyve obviously been gunning for me too

TT: Yes, they helped you chart a path through the Ring. And they will open that path for a pilot they have marked.

TT: I believe I fit the description. I'm not sure about you.

TG: why do you think that

TT: I am the pilot. That's all there is to say on the matter.

TG: but i dont want you to die

TT: Help John and Jade.

TG: this isnt right

TT: Then I'm not going to help you wake you up.

TT: I'll stall some more.

TG: so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit

TT: I said not entirely.

TG: what do you mean

TT: It's going to be a long ride through all this nothingness.

TT: Maybe I just thought some company would be nice.

TT: Before it's all over.

TG: ............

TT: So what'll it be?

TG: what

TT: I'll wake you, but only if you promise to rejoin the others.

TT: Could you give a message to John for me?

TG: sure

TG: but

TG: if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up

TT: Aw, are you sure?

TT: I was looking forward to bowling another wicked googly with the yarn.

TT: Sportsways.

TG: nah ill stay asleep a while

TT: Ok.

TG: what did you want me to tell john

TT: What was that?

TG: what

TT: Did you hear something?

TG: no what

TT: I thought I heard something outside.
