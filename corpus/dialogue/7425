    <span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It never ceases to amaze me how excellent you are at this friendship business. Where would we all be without you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: In a way you really have been the glue holding us all together on our adventure. Gosh youre a standup gal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh which actually reminds me of ANOTHER thing thats been bugging me about dirk.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: He can often be almost hilariously self absorbed. Dont even get me started on when he starts going off on these long monologues about his philosophical gobbledygook.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I'm not sure he actually has much of a filter when it comes to what others regard as interesting points of conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not to rag on the guy too hard but i guess at times i would just like to see a little more self awareness from him is all.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant remember if i mentioned. Oh man but thinking back on what happened its even more ridiculous in retrospect.</span>
