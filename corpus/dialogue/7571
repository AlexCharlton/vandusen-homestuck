    <span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You think so?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not to sound too self obsessed or anything but ive given that some thought.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That maybe there is something special about me that nobody can understand. And maybe thats why i always seem to be botching things up the wazoo with my pals.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe thats why i feel like such a loner. I dunno. Im rambling and ive been thinking about it a lot lately. What about you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Does being special make you screw the pooch with your friends like it does for me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: UGH. NO. I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: FOR MY PEOPLE. THE WORD FOR FRIENDS. IS FLAWS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wow really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: PROBABLY NOT? BUT. IT SHOULD BE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. AS A MATTER OF MY PERFECT PHILOSOPHY ABOUT EVERYTHING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CLEARLY HATE YOUR FRIENDS. AND ARE READY TO SHED THEM LIKE THE DRY SKIN OF A SERPENT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: INDICATES THAT WE SHARE A VERY SPECIAL QUALITY AMONG BROTHERLY BROS. WHO MUST WORK HARDER WITH OUR BRAINS THAN EVERYONE ELSE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO WE MAY ACHIEVE BRUTAL SUPREMACY OVER THEM ALL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Haha. Well i wouldnt go that far. I love my friends!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i was once told i had a lot of potential.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Supposedly thats how all pages are and it takes them for frickin EVER to reach it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And funnily enough it was a figment of my own subconscious that told me this. A part of my untapped potential itself! But disguised as my best bro which was...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Peculiar to say the least.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is that your situation? Are you a page too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: HELL NO. BUT THANKS FOR THE LAUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: MY CLASS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOURS. IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. EVEN THOUGH I JUST LAUGHED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: MINE IS THE BEST OF ALL. WHILE YOURS IS FUCKING TRASH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh? Whats yours then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: LORD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fine then jeez.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sorry for asking!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHAT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: THAT WAS NOT A SHORT REMARK OF FRUSTRATION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT WAS THE ANSWER DUMBASS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT'S THE MASTER CLASS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: DON'T YOU LOSERS DO ANY HOMEWORK ON THIS GAME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: YOU'D THINK YOU WOULD ALL BE EXPERTS. WITH HOW MUCH MY SISTER HARANGUED YOU ON THIS TEDIOUS SHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SINCE I HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS SO FAR. IN PROGRESSING THROUGH THIS DEAD SESSION. I DECIDED. IT WAS TIME TO BITE THAT BULLET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND RETURN HOME. TO RETRIEVE ALL OF HER TERRIBLE TEXTS ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS GAME. AND OF YOUR STORY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: I HAVE PORED OVER EVERY NAUSEATING VERSE. IT HAS BEEN A TRUE EXERCISE IN AGONY. FEW COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND MY SUFFERING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BUT THAT'S OK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BECAUSE I'M NOT THE IDIOT KID I USED TO BE. NOW I KNOW. THAT WHAT IT TAKES FOR ME TO LEARN AND GROW STRONGER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IS EXCRUCIATING EFFORT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: SO I HAVE A CHOICE. WHICH IS TO EITHER BE WEAK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHEN WEAKNESS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: OR TO SUFFER. FOREVER. UNTIL NO ONE ELSE EXISTS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: WHO IS STRONGER THAN ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND THAT'S YOUR CHOICE TOO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: PAGE HUMAN ENGLISH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sakes alive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That is a bit extreme no?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: FOR YOU. PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BECAUSE AS A LOWLY PAGE. AND AS AN EVEN LOWLIER HUMAN. YOU ARE UTTERLY WORTHLESS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND SO YOUR TRIALS I BELIEVE MUST INCLUDE. PROVING TO PARADOX SPACE THAT YOU EVEN DESERVE TO EXIST. IN THE FIRST PLACE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND WHILE MY TRIALS WILL BE SIMILARLY GRUELING. A LORD'S WORTHINESS IS AT NO POINT EVER IN DOUBT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: HIS NOBILITY IS MANIFEST. SUPREME MASTERY WAITS FOR HIM PATIENTLY. LIKE AN EMPTY THRONE UNDER HEAVY GUARD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: REALITY ALREADY KNOWS I WILL PREVAIL. JUST AS IT KNEW I WOULD PREDOMINATE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: AND SO INEVITABILITY IS ALWAYS ON MY SIDE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: IT IS MY. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BORTHRIGHT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: BORTHRIGHT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont think thats a word.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But hey you are the lord and i am the lowly page.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: DAMN STRAIGHT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">uu: NEVER FORGET WHO YOU ARE MEANT TO SERVE.</span>
