    <span style="color: #FFFFFF">Hello.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh my god, why are you talking to me????????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">This is the last time we'll ever talk.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Still sticking with the white text I see. So smooth and stylish!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I forgot how much I loved highlighting it to read all the 8oring things you have to say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's like a fun game for super extra handicapped retarded people. Like opening a present! Find out what o8noxious thing the mystery tool typed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: What is it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">A parting courtesy, I suppose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">All the ways I've exploited you were meant to bring about the events that will take place this evening.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Knowing this will provide context for the events in your near future, and will affect how you behave in response.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">These events will be just as important as those preceding it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I've gone to great lengths, you see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You didn't exploit me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You are just a petty douche with a 8ad temper who likes to pl8y g8mes, and all I did w8s humor you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I did exploit you, very thoroughly. It was easy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So full of yourself!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Have I ever lost a game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Don't ch8nge the su8ject!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">What subject are you referring to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: XXXXO</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'm going to log off in a 8ig huff and you have to promise not to use that nasty trick where you log me 8ack on out of petty douchey spite!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And then we can go 8ack to never ever talking, 8ecause man! That was heaven when it was like th8t!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">There's no need for that kind of assurance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I'll be brief.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I no longer hold you accountable for any wrongdoing. In fact, I've given your transgression very little thought since the incident.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">If you acknowledge this amnesty and regard it as sincere, you may begin to find the odds falling in your favor again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">This may be essential if you are to succeed on your journey.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Mm hmm. Slow down! Man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I am just wearing out so many pens taking all these important notes! Fuuuuuuuuck!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Fuck you for ruining all my good note-taking pens and giving me this terri8le cramp in my good note-taking hand!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Incredible, the risks you take with your scorn.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">But of course it was your unpleasant, simplistic temperament that made you so easy to control.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Vicious and predictable, like an insect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">If you turn a swarm of wasps on a crowd, the outcome is certain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">It takes no skilled strategist to understand this. You were in fact a waste of my talents.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">A primitive expedient.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Blech. What a sno8. You're worse than my meddley meddler meddlefriend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I wonder why they waste their camaraderie on you. I'll never understand it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I thought you said you would 8e 8rief????????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I'll say one last thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Though the magnitude of the ensuing destruction resulting directly from your actions will be neither possible or necessary for you to fathom, there nevertheless ought to be a silver lining.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">The only question is whether you will live long enough to see it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">I'm not a gambling man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">But if I was, I wouldn't bet on it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Goodbye.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Zzzzzzzz. 8ye, assh8le.</span>
