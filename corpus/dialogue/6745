    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, assuming I can actually send it today without another untimely paradoxification.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If not, then hey, you get a sick grill full of birthday slime instead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh hell no. HELL no man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well listen. If youre going to send anything to me slime or otherwise can you please at least not make the shit appear directly over my head this time?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The last thing i need on my bday is another installment of and i quote manbro bukkake theater.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You still don't actually know what that means, do you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not really? Its your friggin figure of speech man. I gathered it just meant getting slimed like in ghost busters or somesuch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kind of. I told you to look it up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah yeah. Im a busy fella dirk!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wikipedia is a lot of letters to type in a thing for a man of action on the go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im always doing adventures remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That is such bullshit, you sit in your little jungle globe watching movies all day.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yes. But ok i have a LOT of movies to bone up on. There are so many good ones i still havent seen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You think literally every film you watch is a masterpiece. I've never felt so much vicarious shame through someone else's atrocious taste in awful garbage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Screw you i have IMPECCABLE standards! Its just theres so much good stuff out there and ive really been on a roll with my picks lately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you even hear yourself, dude?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your &quot;picks&quot; are everything, and &quot;lately&quot; is always.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes i hear myself just fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hear a discriminating gentlemans melodious voice and it strikes my ears as the voice of reason! Heheh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Say heres one im pretty excited about. Have you heard about this avatar jam? Its coming out next year.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You mean the blue furry shit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No man it is not blue furry shit far from it. Get this. It is about this paralyzed fellow who is down on his luck and longs for adventure. And he finds it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But it is far away on an enchanted planet rich with coveted treasures. And adventure is not all that he finds oh no. He also finds romance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: A beautiful blue woman from the wild teaches him the ways of her savage culture and also the ways of alien love. Together they frolic in the forest whilst sharing primal intimacy through magic sexual escapades.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ahahahaha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whats so funny wise guy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To borrow from one of the more benighted sectors of your zeitgeist, that was &quot;so gay.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Excuse me but i fail to see what could possibly be gay about some huge elegant blue men and women having really spiritual intercourse with their tails or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well yeah, obviously not literally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake, where I'm from that word hasn't been used as a pejorative, or even much at all, in a really long fucking time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But youre from friggin texas! Arent you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. But not exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Augh stop being such a cryptic troll all the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Anyway avatar looks spectacular and i think my preemptive review was spot on. The bloody end!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok but what you just said about those furries was gay as hell. It's time to face the facts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You are just treating my great taste in flicks to your aloof hipstery disdain as usual. You dont know anything about that movie. Maybe youll like it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah, I saw it already. That movie sucked the smelliest shit from the ugliest butt. Sorry man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well now i know youre just trolling me. It wont be out for another year!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Here, let me send you the rest of this robot already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You've spent too long alone on that island as it is. I kinda worry about you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A man can only spend so much time in the middle of the damn ocean with nothing but popcultural detritus and his own thoughts to keep him company.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Alrighty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hope it wont be as difficult to finish building as the rest was to assemble.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, just screw the thing on and it's ready to go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Capital!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Scoot that noggin my way at your ready then.</span>
