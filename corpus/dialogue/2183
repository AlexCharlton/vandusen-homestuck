TT: I can't find it anywhere in the house.

TT: No time to worry about it.

TT: The next thing we should do is get your server copy of the game from the car.

TT: You need to connect to my client, so I can repeat your steps and presumably join you, wherever you are.

TT: We should do this quickly, before my house burns down.

EB: what, there's a fire??

TT: There will be soon.

EB: oh jeez!

EB: so move this thing already!

TT: It looks like it requires a lot of grist to move.

TT: I don't have enough to relocate the door, either.

EB: how much do you have?

TT: Zero.

EB: oh.

EB: hmm.

EB: i thought about jumping to the car from the ledge earlier but that sounds really dangerous!

TT: I have a better idea.

TT: Meet me upstairs.
