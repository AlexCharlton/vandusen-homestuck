<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I can't find it anywhere in the house.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No time to worry about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The next thing we should do is get your server copy of the game from the car.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You need to connect to my client, so I can repeat your steps and presumably join you, wherever you are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We should do this quickly, before my house burns down.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what, there's a fire??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: There will be soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh jeez!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so move this thing already!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It looks like it requires a lot of grist to move.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't have enough to relocate the door, either.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how much do you have?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Zero.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i thought about jumping to the car from the ledge earlier but that sounds really dangerous!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I have a better idea.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Meet me upstairs.</span>
