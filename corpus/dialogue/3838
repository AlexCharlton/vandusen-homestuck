GA: Hello Again

GA: Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time

GA: I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be

TT: Pardon?

GA: Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time

GA: The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose

TT: I'm a little busy.

GA: It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time

GA: Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting

GA: Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That

GA: Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She

TT: That sounds about right.

GA: Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema

GA: I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying Scenario

TT: Honestly, I was looking forward to playing along and reading your Dumb Rose script for our next conversation.

TT: But it turned out there was a perfectly logical explanation for it all.

TT: Imagine my disappointment.

TT: While I imagine yours, once you finally catch on.

GA: I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything

GA: What Are You Talking About

TT: I'd love to explain in detail and cause some sort of time paradox.

TT: But you see - and this revelation may be as startling as any -

TT: I'm a little busy.

GA: I Believe I Understand

GA: It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous Conversation

GA: One Which I Have Not Had Yet

TT: Yes, that is definitely a conclusion you have just now drawn.

TT: The only thing left to do is ride out the next several conversations while you maintain that understanding.

TT: And while I maintain the chilly facade you have grown to so enjoy from Smart Rose.

TT: Which shouldn't be too difficult, because... have I mentioned?

TT: I'm busy.

TT: Goodbye.

GA: Fine
