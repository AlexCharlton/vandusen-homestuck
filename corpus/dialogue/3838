<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Hello Again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Pardon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm a little busy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That sounds about right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying Scenario</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Honestly, I was looking forward to playing along and reading your Dumb Rose script for our next conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But it turned out there was a perfectly logical explanation for it all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Imagine my disappointment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: While I imagine yours, once you finally catch on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: What Are You Talking About</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'd love to explain in detail and cause some sort of time paradox.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But you see - and this revelation may be as startling as any -</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm a little busy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Believe I Understand</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous Conversation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: One Which I Have Not Had Yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, that is definitely a conclusion you have just now drawn.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The only thing left to do is ride out the next several conversations while you maintain that understanding.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And while I maintain the chilly facade you have grown to so enjoy from Smart Rose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which shouldn't be too difficult, because... have I mentioned?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm busy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Goodbye.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Fine</span>
