<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: thats it i cant take it anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im going back</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Already?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It just sounds like you're making a rash decision based on temporary aggravation with a laughing puppet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought we planned to progress as far as we could before you went back.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: To gather information, and avoid repeating mistakes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what else is there to know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: we lost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We don't know Jade is dead for sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or the trolls for that matter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: only thing left to do is change all that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you sure you're ready?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You'll remember the plan we discussed?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theres not much to remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know what he was thinking</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: even we couldnt kill one of those things yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with our higher levels and all our sick gear</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It still seems hasty to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe I'm just not as comfortable with time travel as you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: nah itll be fine dont worry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: After you go, what do you think will happen to me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Will I just cease to exist?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean your whole timeline will</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there a chance it'll continue to exist, and I'll just be here alone forever?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm not sure which outcome is more unsettling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the thing with time travel is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you cant overthink it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: just roll with it and see what happens</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and above all try not to do anything retarded</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What do you think I should do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: try going to sleep</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think the true purpose of this game is to see how many qualifiers we can get to precede the word &quot;self&quot; and still understand what we're talking about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: anything else is gravy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If my past self can wake up sooner, maybe I'll be the one to visit you first this time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll fly by and remind you you're already awake and don't know it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah thatd be cool i guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im gonna go now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Good luck.</span>
