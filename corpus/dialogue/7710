TG: so not cool lookin back on it

TG: and i had no excuse i always knew he was just

TG: SUCH a gay dude

TG: and i guess maybe hitting on a guy who dont like girls once or twice maybe is alright or even flattering but after so long it was probably just pissing him off or messing with his head or something

TG: it def wasnt what he wanted to hear from a friend

TG: let alone day in and day out through garbled drunktexts

TG: so when i fuckin harassed him into kissin me...

TG: it just brought back some low rent shit i thought we put behind us

TG: just another way i completely humiliated myself in front of him

GT: So is that why you cant talk to him now?

TG: mmmmmmmm hmmmmmmm

GT: I certainly have no trouble relating to that.

TG: yep

TG: i dont even know why really

TG: hes like taciturn to the max about everything

TG: but theres somethin about him

TG: that just makes it hurt to feel like you let him down
