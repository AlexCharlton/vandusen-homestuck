GG: I have kindly asked Mr. Sebastian to hand over the reins to this silly computer shaped like a man.

GG: What now?

TT: Now you have access to a clean computer, for one thing.

TT: Soon we can get started going through the steps necessary to launch the session.

TT: Oh hell.

GG: What?

TT: Another interruption.

TT: I should step away for a moment to take this message.

TT: He's probably right, I'm distracted by too much bullshit at once lately.

GG: Who's right?

TT: Me.

TT: Jane, I'm going to leave you with the responder for a little while.

TT: Maybe he can help you get started. Think you can handle that, dude?

TT: I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.

TT: I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.

TT: Ok, got it. You and the handle are tight.

TT: We don't need a whole thing about this.

TT: Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.

TT: The handle I mean.

TT: Ok.

TT: Implying we will be married.

GG: :B

TT: Ok, long story short, you and the handle fuck gratuitously. Nuff said.

TT: Try not to say I never gave you any responsibilities, or never took you seriously as a viable conscious being with free will.

TT: Also, please try not to make me regret this.

TT: You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.
