TT: I thought we were getting into a good rhythm there.

TT: Anyway, you missed out on like half the pairings.

uu: WHAT. HALF. NO WE DID MOST OF THEM DIDN'T WE.

TT: No, we did three, and there are three possible matchups left.

TT: Don't you know anything about shipping science?

uu: THAT'S A THING?

uu: HOW THE FuCK COuLD THAT BE A THING.

TT: Believe me.

TT: It's a thing.

TT: Total number of pairings for a group of n people is (n^2 - n) / 2.

TT: You divide by 2 to cut the grid in half, eliminate duplicate pairs.

TT: Minus n is so you don't pair people up with themselves. That wouldn't make sense.

uu: AND WHY THE FuCK NOT??

TT: Well, because...

TT: I don't know.

TT: Maybe you're right. Maybe I was being close-minded about self-pairing. What do I know?

uu: JACK SHIT OBVIOuSLY.

uu: ANYWAY. FuCK ALL THAT. YOu DON'T SPOIL GOOD DEBAuCHERY. WITH A LOT OF STuPID MATH.

uu: YOu MAY THINK YOu'RE SMART. BuT EXCESSIVE SMARTNESS CAN MAKE YOu BE MORE OF AN IDIOT.

uu: INTELLIGENT IDIOCY CAN BE EASILY EXPLOITED BY THE CuNNING AND RuTHLESS. JuST A TIP FOR YOu. BRO.

TT: I'll make a note.

TT: So you sure you don't want even one more drawing?

TT: You used Jane and Roxy in two pairings. But me and Jake only got one.

TT: How is that fair?

uu: I DECIDE WHAT IS FAIR IN MY GAMES.

uu: IF YOu ARE PROPOSING TO ILLuSTRATE THE JAKE HuMAN BEHAVING AMOROuSLY WITH THE DIRK HuMAN. THE ANSWER IS NO.

TT: Why not?

uu: THAT ENCOuNTER DOES NOT SEEM AS REPREHENSIBLY SCANDALOuS.

uu: FIRST OF ALL. I ASK OF YOu. WHERE ARE THE BITCHES AT?

uu: I REST MY CASE.

TT: Lame.

uu: SECOND OF ALL. I DON'T WISH TO LANGuISH IN THE PuMPKIN PATCH.

TT: What?

uu: ORANGE AND EMERALD. uNPLEASANT TOGETHER.

uu: I HAVE NO TASTE FOR PuMPKINS. OR ANY HORRID VEGETABLE MATTER.

uu: MEAT OR CANDY. THAT'S WHAT'S GOOD. THE GAME IS OVER.

TT: Fine.

TT: I'll keep all my illustrated debasements to myself, then.

uu: GOOD. DO THAT.

TT: Ok. I will.

TT: So did I win?

uu: I WILL SAY.

uu: YES.

uu: YOu WERE COOPERATIVE AND GENERALLY ENTHuSED ABOuT MY GAME.

uu: CONGRATuLATIONS DIRK.

TT: Thanks.

TT: So what's the shitty twist?

uu: AH! BuT NOT SO FAST.

uu: YOu SEE. THERE IS A TWIST TO MY SHITTY TWIST.

TT: A twisted twist?

TT: Like... a double mobius handjob or something?

uu: YES. PROBABLY.

TT: Ok.

TT: What is the twist to the twist?
