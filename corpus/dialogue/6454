<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should probably warn you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yet another exploding game trap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She already sent it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's weird.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How is the Jane thing going?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy already destroyed her computer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe if you weren't spacing out so hard you could have prevented that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just saying.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As if you're actually concerned. If you were, you could have said something to Jane instead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Almost like you enjoy sitting back and watching what happens when shit goes wrong.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Has it occurred to you that maybe I have diabolical interwoven plans just like you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You're not the only one who can pull strings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So this is either another bizarre instance of AI-driven irony, or you are admitting that you are actively trying to sabotage my plans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No, our plans are not in contradiction or competition, bro.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You'll see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This means I'll have to improvise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll take over as Crocker's server while Lalonde cleans up her act.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes, I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why are you still talking in red, by the way?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Roxy thinks it looks good on me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't have many opinions on fashion since I am a cold, emotionless automaton who also happens to be an accessory of fashion, but I think she may be right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are you still talking to her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I was for a while. I may yet again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why are you blocking me from viewing the transcripts?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What the fuck are you two even talking about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You, mostly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That doesn't really sit well with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'd almost rather you both engaged in &quot;ironic&quot; flirtation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Who says we don't do that too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ugh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't get what is even your problem with that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Because you obviously do it just to piss me off.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: How do you know?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You don't know me, dude. You don't know anything about me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe we are perfect for each other. I, a street-smart, fast-talking application with a fuckzillion IQ trapped in a pair of triangular sunglasses that literally only the Japanese could consider to embody the Platonic ideal of &quot;cool,&quot; and she, an oft-inebriated lonely hacker teen who just wants a boyfriend. I ran the numbers on this, trust me. It's a match made in goddamn crackpair heaven.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I give her what you can't, and that just drives you crazy. Just admit it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, it's lines like that which make it obvious your only intent is to jerk me around. Nobody actually says shit like that and is serious about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's also obvious because you're me, and I'm sure I would be constantly fucking with my own head if I were you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Touché.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or should I say douché?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You shouldn't say the former, and you should definitely, never, under any circumstance, say the latter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We really should talk about the Jake thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fine.</span>
