    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even drones were replaced with robotic versions. I imagine they were just easier to produce and control, since she'd given up hope of perfectly mirroring her own civilization in all its convoluted symbiotic glory.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But not without a good fight, and not without taking her frustrations out on the human population.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She attempted to enforce &quot;blood casting&quot; through efforts to genetically alter people's blood color. That was an ugly chapter. Lotta fuckin' people died from that debacle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Over the last four hundred years, the population just got smaller and smaller from these atrocities piling up. But she clearly didn't give a shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: All the while, the amount of dry land kept shrinking due to the gradual flooding.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Soon there was hardly anywhere left to live, and then, that was that. No more people.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Damn.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Flooding?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh. Yeah, I probably should have mentioned this up front.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One of the first things she did while in power was begin melting the ice caps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It took a while, but eventually the whole world flooded.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's how it is now. It's totally soaked up in this bitch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wow like the epic kevin costner film?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Almost exactly. Especially by the same degree of shittiness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh man does that mean you have to drink your own pee??????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You get used to the taste. Welcome it, even.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That takes about 15 days in a row of hard piss drinking though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ewwwwwwwwwwww no dude. No ew. :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Relax, I don't drink any goddamn piss, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh ok. Whew.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess your lusis droid thingy sees to it that you have fresh water?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope. Those stopped being a thing a long time ago too, once humans went extinct.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh i thought...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hm. Well who raised you then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nobody, man. I raised my damn self.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: !</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jesus christofer kringlefucker and here i thought i was rugged!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're still pretty rugged. You're just a fucking dork about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess I did have Cal looking after me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Let's not discount the rad service of the C-man, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Heaven forbid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And what about roxy?</span>
