<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: including me! i'm magic now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: and your chauffeur familiar, i guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, he is neither a chauffeur, nor a familiar...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: he is just a new friend!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: also, this is not a magic car, it is an ordinary car.</span>
