<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it means a lot more than that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">your true powers are more impressive than those of anyone else in your crappy quartet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">in fact i would say they are almost as cool as mine &gt;:)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: not sure the ability to make weird spikeballs outta nothin is all that cool tbh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">not just spikeballs!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">imagine that your title is roughly synonymous with &quot;one who steals nothing&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">what do you think it means to be able to steal nothing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: it means</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im like a shitty cat burglar who sucks at her job?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">WRONG</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it means just the opposite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it means you can steal the essence of nothingness from something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">you can rob nothingness from an idea if you put your mind to it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">effectively allowing you to conjure virtually anything out of thin air</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: omg</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u cant be serious</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">im sorry, but your remarks of self deprecation made me very angry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">once i was even more of a dork than you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">but now i am one of the most powerful beings who has ever existed</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">i dont want to hear any whining about what you think you cant do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">you are hereby under strict orders from myself and her condescension to &quot;clam up&quot; and conjure that orb, do you understand?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so im just supposed to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: sit here and think about this ugly ball</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and twiddle my fingers or somethin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">you tell me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">space is my racket, not void</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: maybe it would help if i knew what the dang thing WAS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: how am i supposed to steal the nonexistence from a concept when the concept only exists in my mind as &quot;ugly ball&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">its called the matriorb</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it is the key to resurrecting the troll race</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">once you create it the empress will hatch it on an uninhabited planet located beyond the reach of her cruel employer</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">there her people will have another chance to thrive without the ever looming threat of extinction that comes with his influence</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">so you see roxy, there is nothing noble about refusing to help</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">once an entire alien race went extinct because of a terrible monster, and you can help give them a second chance</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">dont you want that?</span>
