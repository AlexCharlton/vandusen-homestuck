<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and why is it blocking your transporter?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he called it the typheus minion</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i always hated it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: typheus?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like the web browser?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is probably a coincidence though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm, i don't know...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if you think numbers always mean something, why wouldn't browser names?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah maybe.....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, you sure do hate that thing!</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: typheus is the best and that's really all there is to say on the matter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: YEAH RIGHT</span>
