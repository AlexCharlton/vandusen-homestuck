CG: IT'S ME AGAIN, ASSHOLE

CG: THE ONE WHO HATES YOU, REMEMBER?

CG: OR SHOULD I SAY FUTURE-REMEMBER???

EB: karkat!!!!!!!!!!

CG: AGAIN WITH KNOWING MY NAME

CG: IT'S REALLY FUCKING UNSETTLING WHEN YOU DO THAT.

CG: I WONDER HOW FAR BACK YOU KNOW IT

CG: I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A SPECIAL POINT OF NOT BEING THE ONE TO TELL YOU, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE SATISFACTION.

EB: hey, shut up a second!

EB: i need you to be nice for a change and do me a favor...

EB: have you talked to jade recently?

EB: can you tell me what happened to her??

CG: WHO THE FUCK IS JADE.

EB: uh...

EB: hmm.

CG: JOHN, THE FACT THAT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO THINK I CAN READ YOUR MIND JUST UNDERSCORES WHAT A HARROWING GODDAMN IDIOT YOU ARE.

EB: jade is the girl who i am pretty sure just entered our session.

EB: she is my client player.

CG: OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE WHO FUCKS EVERYTHING UP.

EB: um, yeah... i thought you knew that? you talked to her a bunch of times, apparently.

CG: WHY THE FUCK WOULD I KNOW THAT.

CG: THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME I HAVE EVER TALKED TO A HUMAN.

CG: AND THE FIRST TIME, MUCH TO MY MIGRAINE COMPOUNDING REGRET, WAS WITH YOU.

EB: oh!

EB: ok, i see what is going on here.

EB: we are finally getting to our first couple of conversations. cool!

CG: NO, NOT "COOL".

CG: WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS VERY MUCH ANTITHETICAL TO YOUR PRIMITIVE HUMAN NOTION OF "EARTH COOL".

CG: YOU SEE, IN OUR FIRST CONVERSATION, WE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.

CG: IT IS A FOOT WHICH SHOULD HAVE REEKED OF YOUR VERBAL RUINATION.

CG: BUT INSTEAD IT SMELLED LIKE

CG: WELL, LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT.

CG: I AM HERE TO DO WHAT YOU AND YOUR PATHETIC CADRE OF CO-HUMANS FAILED TO DO, WHICH IS SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

CG: I AM HERE TO UTTERLY ANNIHILATE YOUR SHIT.

CG: I WILL STAY ON MESSAGE THIS TIME. I WILL NOT BE DETERRED BY YOUR GOOFY MANNERISMS AND YOUR ABSURD PENCHANT FOR REVELING IN SELF ABUSE.

CG: WE WILL GET OFF ON A FRESH FOOT, AND BY FRESH I MEAN MOST FOUL INDEED.

CG: ITS TOES ARE WIGGLING UNDER YOUR HIDEOUS PINK NOSTRILS. NOW BREATHE DEEP YOUR MISFORTUNE, YOU SAD LITTLE CLOWN.

CG: THIS IS THE END OF YOU. THAT AROMA YOU DETECT WAFTS FROM THE BOUQUET PERCHED ON YOUR CORPSE BOX.

CG: NOBODY CRIES, EXCEPT YOUR SHITTY GHOST. HEAVY SOBS FROM A SPECTER OF UNQUALIFIED FAILURE.

CG: IT IS A SYMPHONY TO MY ANGRY EARS.

EB: so... the smell is from a foot... but also from funeral flowers?

EB: this metaphor is confusing.

CG: STFU

CG: I'M ONLY GETTING STARTED.

EB: yeah, i know!

EB: this is all that big time trolling i was looking forward to.

EB: and it's pretty good so far, and ordinarily i would be excited to hear more...

CG: YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN???

CG: YOU ARE ACTUALLY ENJOYING THIS, WHAT A SICK FUCK.

EB: but i really am concerned about what happened with jade!

EB: my request for a favor still stands, even though this is early you, and you still think you hate me.

CG: DON'T QUESTION THE SINCERITY OF MY HATE, JUST DON'T EVEN FUCKING GO THERE.

EB: ok, fine! you hate me sooooo much, like, for real.

EB: can you just tell me what's up with jade?

EB: can you see her?

CG: YEAH I SEE HER

CG: IT'S MAKING ME MAD SEEING HER

EB: can you tell me what happened? what did she do that was so bad?

CG: HAHAHAHAHAHA

CG: HERE I AM TALKING TO YOU MOMENTS AFTER YOU DID THE TERRIBLE THING, AND YOU STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DID!

CG: INCREDIBLE, YOU TRULY ARE DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT.

EB: ok!!! i'm an idiot! can you just tell me anyway????

EB: whoa...

CG: WHAT

EB: the ground is shaking...

EB: what's going on?

CG: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

CG: WHAT YOU FUCKING DID IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

EB: so tell me what i fucking did!!!

CG: OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU FUCKING DID?

EB: yes!

EB: please, no more stalling or "i already told you's" or any other maddening nonsense!

EB: just...

EB: TELL ME!

CG: VERY WELL, JOHN HUMAN EGBERT.

CG: I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID

CG: READY FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID?

CG: HERE'S ME, TELLING YOU WHAT YOU DID

CG: OK, HERE GOES
