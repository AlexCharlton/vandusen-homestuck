uu: NEVER SAW SOMEONE SPEECHLESS. WHO HAD SO MuCH TO TYPE.

UU: this is absUrd.

UU: yoU nagged incessantly for me to allow yoU to reverse the starting positions of the king and qUeen!

UU: i only agreed to get yoU to shUt Up aboUt it, and regardless, i knew i coUld beat yoU anyway even with yoUr initial "advantage." and i was right!

UU: how can yoU claim this as a legitimate strategy?

UU: yoU broke the rUles!

uranianUmbra [UU] ceased cheering undyingUmbrage [uu]



undyingUmbrage [uu] began jeering uranianUmbra [UU] 

uu: HEY! I DIDN'T BREAK ANY RuLES.

uu: I MERELY ASKED IF YOu WOuLD AGREE. TO ME SWAPPING THE START POSITIONS OF THE KING AND QuEEN.

uu: AND YOu DID AGREE.

uu: BuT THEN I DIDN'T ACTuALLY DO IT.

uu: WHEN DID I SAY I WOuLD? NEVER.

uu: I WAS ONLY GAuGING YOuR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THE EXCEPTION.

uu: I THEN WENT ABOuT DECORATING MY KING AND QuEEN WITH NICE LITTLE HATS.

uu: WHICH IS *ALSO* NOT AGAINST THE RuLES.

uu: YOu DO IT ALL THE FuCKING TIME. GIVE YOuR GAME PIECES HORNS AND SHIT.

uu: YOu EVEN GIVE THEM NAMES AND BLOOD CASTES. YuCK.

uu: SO IF YOu HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY DECORATIONS. I SAY POT. ALLOW ME TO INTRODuCE YOU TO THE FuCKING KETTLE.

UU: i cannot believe yoU are defending this maneUver.

UU: yes, i sUppose some of these tactics are technically within boUnds of the LETTER of the rUles, bUt the entire charade was highly disingenoUs and Unsportsmanlike.

UU: it is Unbelievably childish, even for yoU!

uranianUmbra [UU] ceased cheering undyingUmbrage [uu]



undyingUmbrage [uu] began jeering uranianUmbra [UU] 

uu: I KNOW. I AM A CHILD.

uu: SO ARE YOu. IT JuST SO HAPPENS THAT YOu ARE A CHILD.

uu: WHO JuST GOT FuCKING SERVED.

uu: IT IS NOT AGAINST THE RuLES TO BE CHILDISH. OR DISINGENuOuS. OR uNSPORTSMANLIKE.

uu: IT'S ALSO NOT AGAINST THE RuLES TO BE A BASTARD. WHICH IS ANOTHER THING I AM.

uu: EVERY SINGLE THING I DID WAS LEGAL.

uu: MY QuEEN. DISGuISED AS A KING. MADE MOVES LIKE A KING. WHICH IS WITHIN ITS CAPABILITY. THIS WAS DONE TO DECEIVE YOu.

uu: MY KING. DISGuISED AS A QuEEN. MADE MOVES LIKE A KING. BECAuSE DOING OTHERWISE WOuLD BREAK THE RuLES.

uu: BuT YOu BELIEVED IT HAD HER POWERS. AND I uSED THIS TO MY ADVANTAGE.

uu: WHICH WAS HILARIOuS TO OBSERVE. WATCHING YOu BACK AWAY FROMS "THREATS." FROM WHAT WAS IN TRuTH A DISTANT KING!

uu: ALL THE WHILE MY RuSE. PATENTLY OBVIOuS IN HINDSIGHT. WENT EMBARRASSINGLY uNDETECTED.

uu: NO RuLES BROKEN. NOT ONCE.

undyingUmbrage [uu] began jeering uranianUmbra [UU] 

uu: YOu AGREED TO LET ME START WITH THE KING AND QuEEN IN SWAPPED POSITIONS.

uu: IT'S AGAINST THE RuLES TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION LIKE THAT. EVEN IF YOuR OPPONENT IS BEING OBNOXIOuS ABOuT IT.

uu: YOuR WILLINGNESS TO BREAK THE RuLES IS DISGuSTING TO ME. YOu SHOuLD FEEL ASHAMED OF YOuRSELF.

uu: LuCKILY. AT LEAST ONE OF uS HAS RESPECT FOR THE RuLES.

uu: I STARTED WITH ALL MY PIECES IN THE CORRECT POSITION.

uu: IN SPITE OF YOuR WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW THOSE RuLES TO BE BROKEN.

uu: WHICH AS I HAVE ADDRESSED. IS TOTALLY SHAMEFuL.

uu: YOu ARE VERY FORTuNATE TO HAVE A "BRO" WHO RESPECTS THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME EVEN WHERE HIS "SIS" MIGHT FALTER.

uu: A "BRO" WHO. WHILE FuLLY ADHERING TO THE RuLES. AND EXPOSING YOuR HIDDEN SHAMEFuL TENDENCIES.

uu: STILL MANAGED TO DEFEAT YOu.
