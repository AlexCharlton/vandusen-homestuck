CG: JOHN WHAT THE WET BAG OF HUMAN HORSE SHIT TO THE FACE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING.

CG: OH MY LORD.

CG: NO WONDER YOU LOSERS ALL FUCK UP THIS GAME SO BAD.

EB: what?

EB: i am just acting out a scene from an awesome movie and having some fun, what's wrong with that?

CG: WHAT KIND OF CRAPPY EARTH MOVIE IS THIS.

CG: STUPID RABBIT ASSHOLE SCREWS THE POOCH?

EB: no, it's about these criminals on a runaway plane, and they've got to be stopped by nick cage and john cusack together as a team.

CG: OH.

CG: OK, THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD I GUESS.

EB: it is sweet, so sweet, you would probably like it.

CG: I'VE HEARD OF JOHN CUSACK I THINK.

CG: WASN'T HE IN SERENDIPITY?

CG: THAT WAS PRETTY GREAT FOR A HUMAN FLICK.

EB: hahaha, oh man, that sucked so bad!

CG: OK I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BECOMING FRIENDS IF YOU RECOIL FROM MY OLIVE BRANCH LIKE I'M WIGGLING A GNARLED TREE MONSTER'S DICK IN YOUR DIRECTION.

EB: don't you have alien movies from your alien planet?

CG: YEAH OF COURSE, WE HAVE TONS OF MOVIES AND THEY ARE INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO YOUR PRIMITIVE CINEMATIC NEANDERTHRASHINGS.

EB: ok, so what is a really good one?

CG: YOU'LL PROBABLY LAUGH IF I TELL YOU THE NAME OF ONE.

EB: well, i already laughed when you said the name of one of ours, so who cares?

CG: OK FINE.

CG: ONE THAT IS AMAZING AND IS A CLASSIC IS...

CG: WHEREIN NUMEROUS VIGILANTES CONFRONT PERIL; ONE OF THEM BETRAYS THE OTHERS; (BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE PART OF THE PLAN ALL ALONG);

CG: SEVERAL ATTRACTIVE FEMALE LEADS PROVOKE ROMANTIC TENSION; FOUR MAJOR CHARACTERS WEAR UNUSUAL HATS; ONE HOLDS PLOT-CRITICAL SECRET;

CG: 47 ON-SCREEN EXPLOSIONS, ONE RESULTING IN DEMISE OF KEY-ADVERSARY; 6 to 20 LINES THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS HUMOROUS;

EB: wait...

EB: this is the title?

CG: IT GOES ON.

CG: THEY TEND TO BE MORE LITERAL AND INFORMATIVE THAN YOUR TITLES.

EB: how do you even say them in casual conversation?

CG: WELL WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY.

CG: IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SAYS, HEY GUYS WHY DON'T WE GO SEE A MOVIE, AND THEN EVERYONE JUST ENDS UP THERE.

CG: WATCHING IT.

CG: NOT SAYING IT, THAT'S DUMB.

CG: JOHN, TRY TO THINK OUTSIDE YOUR MINUSCULE CULTURAL BUBBLE FOR A CHANGE.

EB: ok, i just think it's still cumbersome and completely illogical.

CG: YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START RUNNING OUT OF MOVIE TITLES AFTER RACKING UP THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF FILM HISTORY.

CG: YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR CIVILIZATION JUST DIDN'T MATURE ENOUGH OR SOMETHING.

CG: BEFORE LETTING THIS EARTH ARABIAN YOU CALL A GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

CG: MUST EXPLAIN WHY IT SPROUTED SUCH A MISERABLE CROP OF PLAYERS.

CG: INSTEAD OF BASICALLY GODS LIKE US.

EB: well, i've got one of your godly players helping me now, so we can't be in such bad shape.

CG: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.

EB: GC gave me a map.

EB: and showed me a shortcut.

CG: WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING.

CG: THIS ISN'T WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT DOING AT ALL.

CG: HOLD ON LET ME ASK HER ABOUT THIS...

EB: ok.

CG: OK...

CG: NOW SHES JUST OVER THERE GIGGLING AT ME LIKE AN IMBECILE.

CG: WHAT ARE YOU TWO UP TO, WHY ARE YOU IN CAHOOTS NOW?

EB: umm...

CG: OW FUCK!!!

CG: OK SHE JUST WALKED OVER AND PUNCHED ME.

CG: AND SAID IT WAS FROM YOU.

EB: uh, sorry i guess?

CG: I TOLD HER TO STOP THESE SHENANIGANS...

CG: BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHATEVER SHE WAS DOING WITH YOU SHE ALREADY DID A WHILE AGO.

CG: FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST.

EB: i don't know why you guys are doing this to yourselves.

EB: all this time jackassery, it's giving me a headache.

CG: OK IF YOU TALK TO HER AGAIN WHEN SHE TRIES HATCHING MORE PLANS GIVE HER A MESSAGE INTO THE PAST FOR ME.

EB: ok.

CG: TELL HER TO POLISH MY HEAVING BONE BULGE AND SET A TABLE FOR FUCKING TWO ON IT.

CG: ITS FOR OUR CANDLE LIGHT HATE DATE.

EB: i like how you guys have basically resorted to trolling each other, through us.

CG: FUCK YOU.

EB: oh, did you talk to jade yet?

CG: JADE, WHAT WHY WOULD I WANT TO TALK TO HER?

EB: ummm, that's what you said you wanted to do last time you talked to me, i dunno.

CG: OH DAMMIT.

CG: ARE YOU SURE?

EB: yeah, you told me dude.

EB: want me to paste the conversation?

CG: NO NO, GOD NO, I HATE IT WHEN WE START GOING DOWN THAT ROAD.

CG: OK THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

CG: I'VE GOT TO GO.

EB: ok.

EB: but next time you talk to me, you might want to tell me to calm down first so i don't just block you.

EB: back then i won't really want to hear from you.

CG: OK, I'LL DO THAT.

EB: later.
