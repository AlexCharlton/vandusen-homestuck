<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Its format is inherently cooper8tive. The diversity of players, the com8in8tion of their efforts and aspects, this is what awakens the true cre8tive potential of the game. Without them, a session will wither and die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If one enters alone, it completely alters the nature of the game. It changes its purpose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: For a solo player, a challenging quest 8ecomes an insurmounta8le one. A reward of infinite promise 8ecomes a 8oon far more sinister.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The gauntlet which the player must overcome is seemingly designed to 8e impossi8le. For all intents and purposes, it is not actually a game at all. It is a death sentence for any player foolish enough to accept the challenge.</span>
