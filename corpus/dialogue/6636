    <span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: remember how you told me how karkat kept sort of trying to set you up with rose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: you told me this on more than one occasion if i recall!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what is your point!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: jade, listen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: at this point i could not give less of a rat's ass about romancey stuff!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i would rather just play some games, and chill out for several years on this magical flying boat. is that too much to ask?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: not at all! that is perfectly fine</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: when i catch up with our buddies, i'm sure i will give rose a nice, FRIENDLY hug.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: aww</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: whereas i will offer dave a tender bro embrace, and shove karkat down a flight of friendship stairs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: heheheheh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but that is IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's all very complicated and bothersome, jade.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you know. matters of the heart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: *snicker*</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, you may laugh at my choice of words, but it is true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's really befuddling and distracting when you are on a major quest to make universes out of frogs. who even needs it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i guess you have a point</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you remember that troll girl who was sort of into me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: mm hm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that seemed like a pretty big deal at the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it really seemed like she liked me, but also, she was *probably* insane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like, i mean, in a trollish, murderous kind of way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yikes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but craziness notwithstanding, i didn't really know what to think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i thought she was cool at the time. i was honestly kind of flummoxed about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but the point is, when all was said and done, that was just some stuff that happened over one day, which was a whole year ago already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i barely even remember what we talked about. by the time we meet up, she probably won't give a shit about me at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which, let's face it, is probably for the best.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: .....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think we make things more meaningful in our head when they're happening than they really are. like realistically? there were probably a lot of things that went on that day that didn't mean that much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like remember how you said you thought karkat was getting this silly angry crush on you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that was just my hunch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean, do you really think after three years he is still going to have the rage hots for you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i sincerely doubt it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: at least</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i hope not ._.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i don't think even he is that crazy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: anyway, my point is, who even cares about all that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: romance and dating are dumb and boring. we are legendary heroes, and we have bigger fish to fry. like that smug fatass over there on the horizon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he sure looks pleased with himself. just look at him, he thinks he is the undisputed king of that mountain or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that is so outrageous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: follow me so we can seize the high ground against this hideous ocean dwelling marshmallow man, and steal all of his treasure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: after you!</span>
