<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE PERIOD WAS UNREMARKABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SORT OF LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BUT I GUESS I MEAN IT WAS ESPECIALLY UNREMARKABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THIS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO YOU SO OFTEN IT WOULD MAKE ME SICK TO MY HUMAN STOMACH IF I HAD ONE OF YOUR HUMAN STOMACHS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, this time i'll believe you that you aren't human.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: because the skepticism center of my brain is starting to wear kind of thin i guess.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: FINE YOU CAN THINK I'M A FUCKING DOUCHE AND MAYBE I AM BUT HERE'S THE FACT, IDIOT.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK YOU KNOW LESS AND LESS, AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID BECAUSE IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL IT'S NOT LIKE I MAPPED OUT THIS TROLLING ONSLAUGHT VERY WELL IN ADVANCE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEAN, WHEN YOU TROLL SOMEONE YOU JUST SORT OF DO IT. YOU DON'T START DRAWING FLOWCHARTS AND DIAGRAMS AND STUFF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wait...</span>
