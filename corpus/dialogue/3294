CG: HEY JOHN.

CG: CALM THE HELL DOWN.

EB: aaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

EB: how did you find me?????

CG: FIND YOU?

CG: WHAT DO YOU MEAN.

EB: i changed my chum handle to ditch you guys.

EB: how did you find me?

CG: OH.

CG: HA HA!

CG: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

CG: THIS IS THE LITTLE WORD HUMANS SAY REPEATEDLY WHEN SOMETHING TICKLES THEIR ABSURDITY PALATE, RIGHT?

EB: uh...

EB: lame.

CG: WE NEVER LOST YOU.

CG: YOUR RUSE DIDN'T FOOL US.

CG: IT JUST SO HAPPENS WE DIDN'T PARTICULARLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TALKING TO YOU IN THAT TIMEFRAME.

EB: what, the last few months?

CG: WE HAVE THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF YOUR EXISTENCE TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN CONTACTING YOU.

CG: THE PERIOD WAS UNREMARKABLE.

CG: SORT OF LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BUT I GUESS I MEAN IT WAS ESPECIALLY UNREMARKABLE.

CG: THIS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO YOU SO OFTEN IT WOULD MAKE ME SICK TO MY HUMAN STOMACH IF I HAD ONE OF YOUR HUMAN STOMACHS.

EB: ok, this time i'll believe you that you aren't human.

EB: because the skepticism center of my brain is starting to wear kind of thin i guess.

EB: but you're still a major asshole and i don't actually want to talk to you, so bye.

CG: WAIT.

CG: BUT I'M NOT HERE TO TROLL YOU THIS TIME.

CG: WE'RE FRIENDS OK?

EB: hahahahahaha!

EB: oh man, look at this outburst of little human words i'm saying!

EB: from my human mouth!

CG: FINE YOU CAN THINK I'M A FUCKING DOUCHE AND MAYBE I AM BUT HERE'S THE FACT, IDIOT.

CG: I'VE ALREADY HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU.

CG: IN THE FUTURE. I MEAN YOUR FUTURE.

CG: I'VE KIND OF BEEN WORKING BACKWARDS HERE FOR A WHILE. 

CG: AND IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.

CG: EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK YOU KNOW LESS AND LESS, AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID BECAUSE IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

CG: AND I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF A LOT.

CG: AND I'M GETTING PRETTY FUCKING SICK OF IT.

EB: that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard.

CG: WELL IT'S NOT LIKE I MAPPED OUT THIS TROLLING ONSLAUGHT VERY WELL IN ADVANCE.

CG: I MEAN, WHEN YOU TROLL SOMEONE YOU JUST SORT OF DO IT. YOU DON'T START DRAWING FLOWCHARTS AND DIAGRAMS AND STUFF.

EB: wait...

EB: you have something to do with this game, don't you?

EB: i should have known.

CG: OH GOD. 

CG: NOT AGAIN.

CG: NO, FUCK NO, I AM JUST NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU AGAIN.

CG: YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF DIRT ON ALL THIS FROM ME IN FUTURE CONVERSATIONS.

CG: TEDIOUS CONVERSATIONS.

CG: ONES I'VE ALREADY HAD WITH YOU.

CG: WHERE YOUR DEMEANOR WILL GRADUALLY BECOME INEXPLICABLY AND REVOLTINGLY FRIENDLY TOWARDS US.

CG: AND SO I GUESS IT JUST WAS KIND OF INFECTIOUS AND NOW WE'RE ALL BUDDIES I THINK.

CG: IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

CG: THIS HUMAN EMOTION YOU CALL FRIENDSHIP.

EB: friendship isn't an emotion fucknuts.

CG: SEE, THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

CG: YOU'RE MUCH MORE TOLERABLE A GUY THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST, OK JOHN?

EB: why are you kissing my ass?

EB: what do you want? why don't you just tell me what's going on.

EB: are you in the medium?

CG: OK, FINE. YES WE ARE.

EB: like, here in this land, with the clouds and oil and stuff?

CG: MORE OF THIS NARCISSISM.

CG: YOU ALWAYS THINK EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUND YOU.

CG: WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DUMB LITTLE WINDY PLANET OR YOUR PETTY LITTLE QUESTS.

CG: OR FOR THAT MATTER YOUR ENTIRE GAME SESSION.

CG: YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONES PLAYING THE GAME.

CG: EVERY GROUP OF PLAYERS GETS THEIR OWN DISTINCT, BLANK SLATE SESSION.

CG: AS WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU MANY TIMES.

EB: so why don't you just explain it again so i know...

EB: so i don't ask so much in the future???

CG: NO.

CG: FUCK THIS SHIT, JUST NO.

CG: I'M ENDING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'VE SAID IT ALL TOO MANY TIMES.

CG: AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

CG: BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB.

EB: wow, yeah you're totally not trolling me, bro!

EB: i see now we are bffs forever.

CG: THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DUMB

CG: IS AN IMMUTABLE FACT I AM STATING FOR THE RECORD.

CG: IT DOES NOT MEAN ANIMOSITY IS WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE.

EB: oh, ok.

EB: so what do you want.

CG: I NEED YOU TO TELL YOUR FRIEND JADE TO TALK TO US.

CG: SHE WON'T ANSWER OUR MESSAGES IN THIS TIMEFRAME.

CG: IT'S IMPORTANT.

EB: yeah, i don't blame her for not answering.

EB: she pretty much can't stand you guys.

EB: because of all the trolling you did before.

EB: remember?

CG: OK, OUR BAD ON THAT.

CG: JUST TELL HER WE'RE SORRY.

CG: AND TO GET HER GROSS AND TOTALLY UNATTRACTIVE HUMAN BUTT OFF HER UGLY HUMAN HIGH HORSE AND ANSWER MY MESSAGES.

EB: maybe. 

EB: we'll see.

EB: i'm still not really sold on this friendship thing yet.

EB: but i've got to go now and get on with my petty little quests.

EB: so talk to you in the future i guess.

EB: jerkface.
