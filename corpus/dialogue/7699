    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane, you know,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We probably should have talked about this Jake stuff a long time ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Tell me about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know if I was kidding myself all those years that there was a conflict of interest between us, or what.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe I was just pretending your feelings for him weren't a factor because my pursuit of him was already overcomplicated enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or maybe it was more like I was aware of them, but on some level decided they shouldn't matter, because I felt like you had a natural advantage over me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cause you know. You're like.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not a dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I always felt you had the advantage over me too!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Because you're... YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You make things happen, and I don't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah well. Turns out maybe that's not such a good quality if you wanna make a relationship last longer than three seconds. At least not in my case.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know I ripped into him pretty hard when I had the clown hair and the little soda can on my head.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the truth is I was pretty goddamn overbearing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes I look back on stuff and think I might have essentially bullied him into a relationship with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Actually, it's more complicated than that. Parts of me were operating independently from myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So it's like I was bullying myself into bullying him into liking me. If that makes sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It doesn't really. But that's fine. :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, my insanity scared him right the fuck off. There were times when I basically treated him like shit without even realizing it, and I regret it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should probably tell him that, but given how I just called him an asshole while wearing orange suspenders, I'm probably the last person he wants to hear from now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Clearly we both used some poor judgment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Looking back, it seems crazy to me that we both jeopardized our friendship over a mutual infatuation with, let's face it, one spectacularly goofy kid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Can we both at least agree we may have overrated the allure of Jake English?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe if we could have talked to each other about him it would have helped. Like talked about why we felt that way about him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: At least maybe it would have helped us knock English down from the ludicrous pedestal we put him on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah. That might have saved us a lot of grief.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's not like I hate him now, even though that's probably what he thinks. He's still my friend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But the extent to which I centered my whole life around a childish fantasy about him is just painfully embarrassing in hindsight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I wonder if I'll ever be able to look at him again without feeling miserable about myself?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So does that mean we're both totally over him now? I can't really tell.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Me neither. :\</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess the real problem is our clique was too small.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Poor Jake was the only viable romantic target. I mean, considering our respective orientations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe we just never knew enough people?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Perhaps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or maybe we just don't need anybody.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: As anything other than friends, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the interest of appeasing the bitterness gods, let's go with the latter.</span>
