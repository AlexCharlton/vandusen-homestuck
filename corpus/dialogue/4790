EB: oh, nothing.

EB: i am just dropping monsters all over the place, that is all.

EB: are you upstairs?

GG: yes

EB: ok, good.

EB: i left the cruxite by the lathe, as well as the punched card with the green thingy on it.

EB: you should have plenty of time to make it. no drama here!

GG: nice!

GG: how much time?

EB: a little more than 6 minutes.

EB: in the meantime, i will try to contact rose and get this prototyping nonsense sorted out.

EB: it's so confusing...

EB: in my foolishness, i came very close to prototyping your grandpa.

GG: D:

GG: john, try to be more careful!

EB: we very nearly had to face our grandfatherly paradox-dad as a last boss.

EB: that would probably be the worst case scenario.

GG: um.....

GG: what?
