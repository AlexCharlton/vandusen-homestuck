GC: 1 H4V3 4 T1P FOR YOU

How were you able to contact me?

Never mind, I figured it out instantly.

GC: R34LLY?

Yes, through my limitless intellect.

Occasionally I discover there are things I have not always known.

It gives me the opportunity to make deductions, which are practically always flawless.

It's gratifying.

GC: UH OK

GC: TH4TS N34T 1 GU3SS

You asked your clever friend with the colorful spectacles to trace the source of my messages.

He then established a relay for your messages to reach this source through some sort of computational proxy.

I gather he has recovered from his implementation as a weapon in the sabotage of your mutual friend, whom you both believe to be dead.

GC: OH MY GOD WH1T3 T3XT GUY!

GC: SHUT UP! >:O

But if you wish, you may refer to me as Mr. Vanilla Milkshake.

GC: 1S SH3 NOT?

Yes, I said you believe she is dead.

And soon, you will believe she is not.

Both statements are true.

And yet each exhibits a trace of falsehood.

GC: WOW WHY D1D 1 BOTH3R 4SK1NG

It's disturbing.

But sometimes that is the nature of these hollows in my perception.

It feels a bit like dark water, sloshing about the cavity in my head.

What do you know of this?
