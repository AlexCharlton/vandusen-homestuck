<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i thought you were going to regale me with stories of your ascent through the windsock tiers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: such that i may through osmosis glean the vagaries of godhood</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: then all i got to do is wait for this rude tidal wave of epiphanies n junk to wash over me and get me hella wise</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: then and only then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i will b able to make this shitty egg happen</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: at the beginning!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you mean like when i first became a god tier?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's a long story... i was kind of tricked into that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it might take some setup to understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: dude look</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i dont have grand illusions that this yarn you spinll be like some actual efficacious tutelage on fuckin pajama spells</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: in that case, i guess it all started on my thirteenth birthday.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which was three years ago, by the way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i heard about this awesome game, or at least one i thought was awesome, and i wanted to play it with my friends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but it wasn't so easy to start. i had to get it from the mail, which meant sneaking around the house while avoiding my dad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which was kind of stupid and childish in retrospect, but blah blah blah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: blah blah blah blah blah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.</span>
