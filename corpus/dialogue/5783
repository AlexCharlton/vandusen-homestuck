GT: is this conversation over now? can i keep packing my present?

AG: The conversation as it went 8efore is already over. I said good8ye, and you 8locked me. Don't you remem8er?

GT: well,

GT: i was going to block you. but then...

GT: i didn't for some reason.

AG: Exactly. 8ecause we've already 8een through this. You're either asleep, or dead like me.

AG: Man! I can't 8elieve I let her trick me like that. Such an amateur mistake.

GT: i guess i am feeling something like deja vu... maybe.

GT: i still don't think i believe you, though.

AG: Hey........

AG: Do you have any recollection at all of the last message I sent you 8efore I died?

GT: i don't even know who you are!!!

AG: Yeah, I figured. Just as well. I made some pretty em8arrassing confessions to you.

AG: I guess I'm getting what I asked for in a way. Even though it's not what I pictured.

GT: what did you ask for?

AG: I asked you if you wanted to........

AG: You know.

AG: Hang out.

GT: was this after you killed me, and gave me immortality?

AG: Yes.

AG: So what do you say?

AG: Or, what do you think you might have said?

GT: about what?

GT: you mean, hanging out?

AG: Yeah.

GT: oh god, this is so ridiculous. you are just a crazy troll on the internet, and i need to get back to packing up this present for my friend! we are not going to hang out, i'm sorry.

AG: John, there is no present! You are not in your hive, and you don't have anything to send. She received it a long time ago. None of this matters anymore.

AG: If you don't 8elieve me, you are free to look out your window.

GT: what will that accomplish?

AG: It might help you remem8er.

AG: And........

AG: You will 8e a8le to see me.

AG: If you want.
