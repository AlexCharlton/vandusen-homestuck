AG: Whaaaaaaaat.

GA: Just Wanted To Know

GA: Is Your Lusus Dead Yet

AG: Huh? What kind of question is that!

AG: Is this a trick? Are you trying to sa8otage me? Are you in cahoots with someone????????

GA: Uh No

AG: Cahoooooooots!!!!!!!!

AG: Cahoots I say.

GA: You Sure Do Seem To Be Saying Cahoots

GA: Im Just Asking

GA: Because Mines Dead

AG: What? Oh no.

AG: How did that happen?

GA: It Was Just Her Time

AG: Really? Are you sure it wasn't sa8otage? I would suspect sa8otage if I was you.

GA: No There Was No Plot Or Conspiracy Or Any Trace Of Saboteurs Operating Through The Special And Magical Union One Can Only Describe As Being In Cahoots With Another

GA: When A Virgin Mother Grub Abdicates And Renounces Brooding

GA: Her Time Will Be Relatively Short

GA: I Always Knew This

AG: ::::(

AG: She was so cool, you had the coolest lusus of anyone I know.

AG: I wanted to meet her some day.

GA: Maybe You Still Can

AG: Yeah, meet her corpse! I guess that's not so bad a consol8tion prize.

AG: Seeing a 8ig dead cool mother gru8. Wow!

AG: You were so lucky. My lusus sucks! Haha.

AG: Why did you ask if she's dead, anyway? Do you know something????????

GA: They Are All Dying

GA: Or Are Going To Soon

GA: I Believe Its A Preemptive Consequence Of The Game We Are About To Play

GA: If A Preemptive Consequence Is A Concept That Can Be Said To Hold Any Meaning

GA: But From What I Understand If It Is Applicable In Any Sphere At All Then This Game Holds That Sphere

AG: Okaaaaaaaay, I don't really get that. So you can just go ahead think I'm some dum8 flighty 8road again.

GA: I Wasnt Going To Think That

GA: You Know What I Dont Think Even I Really Understand What I Just Said So Nevermind

AG: Now you have me a little worried. Man! I hope she's ok.

AG: Why would this happen? This is just my luck. Have some died 8esides yours????????

AG: And uh, you know who's, I guess. ::::o

GA: Yes A Few

GA: Karkat Thinks Its His Fault

GA: He Believes His Actions Triggered An Inauspicious Chain Reaction

AG: You mean a curse?

GA: Sure

AG: Wow, between his curse and my shitty luck we are so screwed.

GA: Im Not Surprised To See You Endorse His Paranoia Without Hesitation

GA: But I Was Attempting To Illustrate A Point In Bringing It Up

AG: Whew! There goes another one sailing over the idi8t girl's head! Ok, lay it on me.

GA: These Events Are Inevitable And Regardless Of Whatever Emotional Entanglements Obfuscate Their Significance They Will Ultimately Serve An Important Purpose

GA: The Curse Had Nothing To Do With It

GA: And Karkats Notion Of A Curse Is Inseparable From His Perception Of Events As Intrinsically Negative And As Tailored To His Personal Dissatisfaction

GA: And Your Bad Luck Is The Same Way

GA: I Believe Anyway

AG: Uh. Ok.

GA: What Would Happen If You Just Cleaned Up A Bit

GA: Dont You Think You Would Step On A Few Less Hard Triangles

AG: Why do you try to help me and stuff? What's the point!

AG: It's kind of bothersome. And insulting sometimes!

AG: So I have a messy room. 8ig deal. My luck fucking 8lows! It's got nothing to do with it and you just don't even know.

AG: Meddler. Why you so meddley, Miss Meddlesome McFussyfangs????????

GA: Because Youre Dangerous

AG: No way! I'm just fine. Why don't you can it.

GA: Every Time You Tell Me To Can It I Think Its Funny

GA: I Mean Its Just A Funny Thing To Say Dont You Think

AG: ::::P

GA: Its Ok To Be Dangerous

GA: Lots Of People Are

GA: And Dangerous People Can Be Really Important

GA: Maybe Even The Most Important Sometimes

GA: But It Just Means Theres Got To Be Someone Around To Keep An Eye On Them

GA: And If Not Me Then Who

GA: Everyone Has An Important Job To Do

AG: Ok, so you're spying on me. Kind of creepy! Man, m8y8e you should get a l8fe.

AG: Or you know, if you're so h8gh 8nd might8 an8 th8nk you're so gr8at, m8y88 you c8uld oh I d8n't kn8w........

AG: TRY AND ST8P ME FROM DO8NG B8D THINGS????????

GA: That Wouldnt Work

GA: If I Tried To Stop You You Would Regard Me As An Enemy

GA: Instead Of Merely As A Nuisance

GA: And What Good Would That Do

GA: So Im Afraid Mcfussyfangs It Must Be

AG: U88888888h!

AG: Ok, gr8. Fine! I'm going to check on my lusus now.

AG: 8ut I'm starting to think you are full of shit, and I am quite sure she will 8e QU8TE FIN8!

GA: Youre Right Anything Can Happen I Guess

GA: But Just So You Know Im Sorry For Your Loss In Advance
