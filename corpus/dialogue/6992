<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i am primarily telling yoU this as a last resort, in hopes of saving myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU see, this rUle between me and my brother is a kind of trUce.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we have both agreed not to say oUr names to anyone so that things will not get oUt of hand, and so it became one of the rUles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if anyone were to say his name to me, i woUld immediately fall asleep, and he woUld wake Up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so yoU will Understand if i refrain from telling yoU his as well. ~_u</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now, chronologically speaking, i have never contacted yoU after this moment.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: so if i never wake Up from my next nap, yoU will never hear from me again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU do not hear from me later, i woUld very mUch appreciate it if yoU coUld message my brother, and say my name.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it may be the only chance i have to wake Up again.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, i can have romantic feelings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUst not the flUshed kind, which hUmans describe as romantic love.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok but</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i didnt think that was alien to you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: not the way u made it sound</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like dont trolls have the 4 kinds and one kind is just staight up love feelins</span>
