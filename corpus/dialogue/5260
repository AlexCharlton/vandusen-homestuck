CCG: THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST MEMO I WILL WRITE.

CCG: BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.

CCG: AND SECOND OF ALL, I MIGHT BE DEAD SOON.

CCG: I'M JUST HOPING SOME OF YOU IDIOTS READ THIS, AND EVEN IF YOU THINK I'M FULL OF SHIT NOW, WHEN IT ALL STARTS GOING DOWN YOU MIGHT JUST REMEMBER WHAT I SAID AND SAVE YOURSELVES.

CCG: THE WORST CASE SCENARIO HAS HAPPENED.

CCG: THE BARD OF RAGE IS ON THE LOOSE.

CCG: YEAH, I KNOW WE ALL THOUGHT THAT TITLE WAS A JOKE, BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T.

CCG: HE'S COMPLETELY SNAPPED, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU FURTHER AHEAD ON THE TIMELINE, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW DANGEROUS HE IS.

CCG: REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO THE BLACK KING.

CCG: NOBODY COULD EXPLAIN IT, AND THEN HE JUST WENT BACK TO SPACING OUT FOR THE REST OF THE BATTLE.

CCG: I MEAN SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT.

CCG: I DON'T EVEN THINK THE KING COULD FUCKING BELIEVE IT, FRANKLY.

CCG: DID ANYONE'S ATTACK DO AS MUCH DAMAGE? I DON'T THINK SO.

CCG: I DON'T EVEN THINK VRISKA'S DID, ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO SAY SINCE THAT WAS THE KNOCKOUT BLOW.

CCG: ^^^ SPOILERS.

CCG: I GUESS WE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A SECRET JOKE POWER OR SOMETHING?

CCG: BUT THE JOKE IS ON US.

CCG: HE IS OUT OF PIE, AND NOW THE FAYGO GENIE IS OUT OF THE SHITTY SODA BOTTLE FOR GOOD.

CCG: WE ARE SO SCREWED.

CCG: OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK.

CCG: GUYS, I AM TERRIFIED, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

CCG: I'M IN A ROOM FULL OF BODIES, AND I THINK I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TURN MY BACK ON THEM?

CCG: OH MY GOD, I JUST HEARD A HONK.

CCG: OH GOD OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD

CCG: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

CCG: IT CAME FROM THE HORN PILE

CCG: I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS JUST THE BODY SETTLING ON AN ERRANT HORN OR...

CCG: OR IF...

CCG: I HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
