<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It is true. To a human, the ways of trolls from 8oth Alternia and 8eforus will seem very strange.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In fact, prior to uniting in the afterlife, even the two groups of trolls were reasona8ly alien to one another.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I've had a gr8 deal of time to study the cultures of many species throughout paradox space. No matter which race you 8elong to, one can always find another whose ideals pose a challenge of comprehension to even the most open minded.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And though the ethical standards of those from Alternia may seem unpalata8le to you, rest assured there are 8eings elsewhere in the cosmos whose violent 8ehavior would 8e considered extreme even to most trolls.</span>
