    <span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: oh looks like you got caledfwlch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: you found that pretty fast</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is that how you pronounce that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: thats an awesome question</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: fuck yeah it is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah thats what i figured</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: hahahaha</span>
