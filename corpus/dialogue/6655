<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: im curious about why a couple of freaks like you were sent to welcome me to hell</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: water you demons or somefin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: pretty lame demons if you ask me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: way too frondly and stupid</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: no, we're humans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: by which i mean aliens, i guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: so like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: youre dead aliens huh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: whoever heard of an alien ghost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know, right? that's what i think sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's strange combination of sci-fi things. like alien stuff is all about science, right? at least it is in movies. aliens LOVE science. but then ghosts have nothing to do with science, they belong to the supernatural realms, which have more to do with religion i guess? or about a lot of hocus pocus and superstition, maybe even magic. science rarely enters the equation, unless it's something awesome like ghost busters, which makes ghosts and stuff ALL ABOUT science, even though the ghost science is obviously a bunch of total nonsense. i guess contact mixes aliens and ghosts because jodie foster saw her ghost dad in outer space? but then, that was probably just a science projection from an alien, to make her feel less sad about her dead dad, and not a real ghost or anything. i guess the lesson is that science and aliens teach us that ghosts and religion are fake? although, it turns out ghosts and aliens are actually real, so maybe science and religion have been lying to us all along. *shrug*</span>
