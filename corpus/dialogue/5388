TG: im dead

AA: yes

TG: then this isnt a memory or a dream at all

TG: its the afterlife

AA: yes and no

AA: yes and 2 nos!

AA: it is the afterlife

AA: but what is happening now is taking place in a bubble which is accessible to the living through dreams under the right conditions

AA: and it is also your memory

AA: the entry point for any bubble is always a memory

AA: either a memory of the dead

AA: or a memory of the living dreamer come to visit!

AA: but once you realize it is not just a memory

AA: what happens next is up to you
