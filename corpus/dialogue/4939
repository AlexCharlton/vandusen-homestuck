<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're underestimating the nature of the threat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: At this point, the threat isn't to our session, or any given universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's to the perpetuation of reality itself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You wouldn't be saving them, per se.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You'd be saving everything.</span>
