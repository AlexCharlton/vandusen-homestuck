TT: But she must have been the first to understand how dangerous the Baroness was, while acting in covert opposition.

TT: Others would follow, and continue to as of now, in your time period.

GT: These are your ancestors?

TT: Yeah, mine and Roxy's were among them.

GT: Anyone ive heard of?

TT: Of course. All these fuckers are totally famous, obviously.

GT: Oh sure obviously.

TT: We've talked about the guy I'm genetically derived from a lot actually.

TT: Like, you know, every time I've ever talked about my bro?

GT: Gadzooks of course!!!

GT: With all your future mindfuckery you made me completely forget about your vaunted hollywood sibling.

GT: I shoulda asked where he fit into the picture if you were raised alone. I can be dumb as a bag of penny candy sometimes.

TT: Sometimes.

TT: Other times you're on point, like a bag of the nickel shit.

GT: Right. So then he was never actually your bro?

TT: No, that's just kind of how I view him.

TT: Lalonde took a more maternal view of her ancestor.

GT: The lady who wrote all the dreary wizard books i presume?

TT: Yeah, the CotL series. Ever read it?
