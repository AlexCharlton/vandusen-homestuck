    <span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Anyway, I have no idea what to do now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Her ill-advised power play has ruined everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: we still have this treasure here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: why dont we just do the shit without her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you could whip up another ghost army</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: march it strait to english and start beatin him down</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I don't think so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: why not</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If you want to know the truth........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: When we were manipul8ting all those ghosts, Aranea was doing most of the work.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Her a8ilities are a lot more advanced than mine. I guess 8ecause she's 8een around for so long?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I was kind of riding her coattails, making it seem like it was a true colla8oration 8etween us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It was actually very nice of her to allow people to get that impression. She didn't have to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I should have just told every8ody that. I guess I wanted to 8elieve it too. Like we were equal partners in crime. Ancestor and descendant united at last, and working gr8 together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I hope you don't think that makes me a huge phony.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: why would i give a fish about that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You're right, you wouldn't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I shouldn't 8e saying needy shit like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I'm just a 8it depressed, 8ecause it feels like I'm running out of friends all over again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i hear you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: she ditched me too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: cant blame her i guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: what can i say girl loves her piratesona</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: she wanna be dat pirate chick so bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: who am i to fault ambition</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: she cast her lure into the lake of cute but dumbass dreams</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i think her mindfang ideal is ridic to be lochness with you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: that journal man</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: tales from the pirate who wont shut up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: im not one to talk about hero worship</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i think my adult self happens to be the best best greatest most perfect beautiful woman -----EV-----ER an if you axed me if i wanted a crack at her job id be like glub yes put me down for T)(AT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: so i legit hope it works out for her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: that dont mean i didnt get ditched</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and that just</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: 38(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: makes me reel sad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: you sure we cant salvage the plan without her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Possi8ly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The way I was picturing it, a major feature of the original three pronged approach was to use the army to lead a first wave assault against him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Then while he was preoccupied 8y all those ghosts swamping him, I would go in for the kill with the secret weapon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: So without an army, I guess we'd need to get close enough to him to use it 8efore he killed us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: like uh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: sneak up on him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut I get the feeling Lord English is not the kind of guy you can just sneak up on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: kay what if</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i found some way to teleport over to him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: and i beat the shit out of him with my wrestling moves</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: then you bust out the weapon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hahahaha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That would 8e awesome, if somewhat implausi8le.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I guess we can think it over.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut if we're getting real here, this has all made me feel pretty lukewarm on the plan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Aranea checking the fuck out. And me recoiling at her hu8ris, which is o8viously just........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: My OWN 8ullshit, getting thrown 8ack in my face?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's a 8it much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You have to 8e a8le to trust your own judgment to make good plans, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I don't know if I do anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I certainly don't right now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Remem8er when our crew started re8elling against me in that cave, and I was kind of lashing out?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I think I might have 8een forcing it a little?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Like that whole dramatic speech I gave when I jumped into the flaming pit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Was that really a genuine thing, or like, a desper8te last attempt to 8e who I think I should 8e?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: that was badass though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i mean yeah you were chewin the scenery an being hammy as fuck but i thought it was cool and kinda funny</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It wasn't supposed to 8e funny though!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: oh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Ah man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I really don't know what to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I'm too depressed to think proactively a8out any of this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: May8e the truth is I don't even care all that much if anyone stops Lord English.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I think all I really cared a8out was getting to do it myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: thats a good enough reason if you ask me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but hey if you aint feelin it you aint feelin it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What if we just........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Gave up on the mission?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: gave up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yeah.</span>

<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: it would be</span>
