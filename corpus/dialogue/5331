CG: EQUIUS, ARE YOU THERE?

CT: D --> Yes

CG: OK, GOOD

CG: ARE YOU STILL REALLY STRONG?

CG: LIKE, IS THAT STILL YOUR THING?

CT: D --> I am still e%ceptionally STRONG

CT: D --> Strength continues to be my STRONGEST attribute

CG: OK GOOD.

CG: I GUESS THAT WAS A PRETTY DUMB QUESTION.

CG: I NEED YOUR HELP.

CT: D --> With what

CG: GAMZEE IS ON A RAMPAGE

CG: HE'S GOING TO KILL US ALL IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.

CT: D --> You mean

CT: D --> The highb100d

CG: WHAT?

CG: YEAH, I GUESS

CT: D --> Oh dear

CG: WHAT

CT: D --> Are you saying the highb100d has finally embraced his position atop the hierarchy

CG: NO I'M SAYING HE FUCKING SNAPPED AND WANTS TO MURDER US ALL

CT: D --> Yes e%actly

CG: DAMMIT, WHY DOES THIS CONVERSATION HAVE TO BE SO PREDICTABLY TERRIBLE

CG: ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO

CG: NO, ORDERING YOU TO DO

CG: IS GO FIND GAMZEE AND BEAT HIM TO DEATH WITH YOUR BARE HANDS, OR POSSIBLY TWO HALVES OF A BROKEN BOW, BEFORE HE KILLS ANYONE ELSE.

CT: D --> I certainly appreciate the debauchery inherent in receiving an order of such gravity from a rogue-b100ded foulmouth

CT: D --> But

CT: D --> I'm not entirely positive I can raise a hand to the highb100d

CT: D --> It wouldn't be my place

CG: OH MY GOD

CG: WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT IN ALL THE MOST FUCKED UP WAYS POSSIBLE?

CG: YOU'RE GETTING OFF ON THIS AREN'T YOU

CT: D --> Uh

CG: IF YOU ASK ME FOR A TOWEL I AM GOING TO FLIP MY SHIT RIGHT OFF THIS FUCKING METEOR

CG: IT WILL JUST BE ME, SPINNING AND SPINNING AND SPINNING INTO ENDLESS NOTHING, SCREAMING

CT: D --> No, I have a sufficient supply of drying utilities

CG: I FORBID YOU FROM GETTING OFF ON ANY OF THIS

CG: DON'T GET OFF ON MY ORDERS, DON'T GET OFF ON PHRASES LIKE FUCK FUCK FUCKETY FUCK, AND DON'T GET OFF ON ANY SORT OF WEIRD ADMIRATION YOU MIGHT BE HARBORING FOR A MURDEROUS CLOWN WITH PURPLE BLOOD

CT: D --> The b100d

CT: D --> It is just so

CT: D --> E%quisitely purple

CG: ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

CT: D --> Yes

CT: D --> But 100k

CT: D --> The situation is very delicate I believe

CT: D --> The highb100d would benefit from a proper enculturation into the aristocracy

CG: I DON'T THINK HE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT YOUR ETIQUETTE LESSONS, OR HOW A TRUE GENTLEMAN IS TO GO ABOUT HANDLING A PROPER FUCKING HORSE TEAT

CG: SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER HERE.

CT: D --> I'll take measures to ensure our comrades aren't injured

CG: OK, AND?

CT: D --> Well

CG: BUT YOU WON'T FIGHT HIM, IS THAT IT

CT: D --> If it comes to close quarters skirmish, I will try to be prepared

CG: HOW FUCKING REASSURING!

CG: YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT, I DON'T GET IT

CG: YOU KISS THE GROUND THIS LUNATIC WALKS ON BECAUSE HE HAS PURPLE BLOOD

CG: BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM RIPPING ON ERIDAN, I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU DON'T LIKE HIM

CG: AND HIS BLOOD IS EVEN PURPLIER, ISN'T IT?

CT: D --> Yes

CT: D --> That's different

CT: D --> He is a sea dweller

CT: D --> Our feud is codified in tradition

CT: D --> Neigh, we are obligated to be at odds

CT: D --> It's dignified

CG: OK FINE, THEN SPEAKING OF WHICH

CG: HE'S ON A MURDEROUS RAMPAGE TOO

CT: D --> He is

CT: D --> How many of us are rampaging murderously, e%actly

CG: I DON'T KNOW, AT LEAST THREE PROBABLY, BUT WHO EVEN KNOWS AT THIS POINT

CG: THE POINT IS, IF YOU SEE HIM, WOULD YOU MIND SNAPPING HIS STUPID WAND IN HALF OR SOMETHING?

CG: AND THEN CHOKE HIM TO DEATH WITH HIS OWN SHITTY PRETENTIOUS SCARF.

CT: D --> Do I really have to

CG: GOD, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM NOW?

CT: D --> I'd prefer not to interact with him

CG: WHY

CT: D --> It's primarily that his advances make me uncomfortable

CG: HAHAHAHAHAHA.

CG: I WOULD HIGH FIVE YOU IF IT WOULDN'T SHATTER EVERY BONE IN MY HAND.

CG: AND IF YOU DIDN'T SMELL TERRIBLE.

CG: BUT SERIOUSLY, IF YOU COULD CARRY OUT MY ORDERS IN THE LEAST PERVERSE WAY POSSIBLE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

CG: JUST KILL ONE OR MORE OF THOSE ASSHOLES AND GET BACK TO ME, OK?

CG: I NEED YOU TO COME THROUGH FOR ME, BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF MANPOWER HERE.

CT: D --> We are

CG: YES DIDN'T I MENTION? FEFERI, KANAYA AND TAVROS ARE DEAD, SOLLUX IS UNCONSCIOUS, AND TEREZI IS MISSING.

CG: OH GOD, I HOPE SHE'S OK, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO LOOK FOR HER

CT: D --> Oh shoot

CT: D --> E%cuse my vulgarity

CG: I'LL LET IT SLIDE.

CG: JUST DO WHAT I SAY, OK.

CT: D --> I will 100k into it
