<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I consider you to be a lovely lady of the highest caliber and i really think any gent worth his salt would be a huge bozo to let the chance to go steady with you slip through his fingers.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You would??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Probably but im kind of babbling here. The point is those are all just silly daydreams about stuff and about your feelings for me that i was projecting on you which werent even real.</span>
<br />
