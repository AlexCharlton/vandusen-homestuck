<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it was huge, and it took a long time to explore. it was eerily empty too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i had that weird feeling of getting to a place in a video game you are not supposed to be yet, because you don't have the right powerups and such.</span>
