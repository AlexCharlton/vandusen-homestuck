EB: it was huge, and it took a long time to explore. it was eerily empty too.

EB: i had that weird feeling of getting to a place in a video game you are not supposed to be yet, because you don't have the right powerups and such.

EB: you know what i mean?

AG: Not really.

AG: I'm used to taking shortcuts whenever I play games.

EB: oh, ok.

EB: so, i started getting crazy nervous the longer i was down here, and i was starting to wonder if my silly iron pogo hammer would even do any damage against the monster.

AG: *Snort.*

EB: what?

AG: Against a denizen? Of course that piece of shit isn't going to do anything.

AG: If I were you, I would have chucked it into the forge.

EB: excuse me, it is called the wrinkle fucker, and it is totally amazing.

AG: It might 8e alright if you com8ined it with something awesome.

AG: Like some cool dice, for instance.

EB: that's so absurd, like anything like that would ever even happen!!!
