TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound

TG: do you host east european industrial raves

TG: nevermind the point is

TG: im out of grist

TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule

TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall

TT: Right now?

TT: The spoils would sink.

TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess

TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave

TT: And then what?

TG: what do you mean

TG: you kill it

TG: release a shitload of grist

TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull

TG: does it even have a skull

TG: or a brain stem

TG: can you find out

TT: That sounds malicious.

TG: what

TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow

TT: That was self defense.

TT: Murdering a wounded behemoth in its sleep strikes me as unseemly.

TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck

TT: Maybe you could replicate a pillow I could use to smother it.

TT: Make it a clean hit.

TT: I would use one of mine but they've all mysteriously gone missing.

TG: wow fuck ok

TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns

TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind

TT: Does John know we've been sapping his grist yet?

TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him

TT: Hold on, someone's messaging me.

TG: yeah me too
