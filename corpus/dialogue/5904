PCG: I DIDN'T EVEN GET A PASSWORD LAST TIME.

PCG: I HAD TO LEAVE ABRUPTLY BECAUSE SOLLUX AND ERIDAN STARTED DUELING AGAIN.

PCG: AND THEN FEFERI AND KANAYA...

PCG: IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

PCG: AND NOW GAMZEE IS HUNTING US ALL DOWN IN MURDER MODE.

PCG: HE'S BEEN TAUNTING ME THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S MESSAGING DEVICES.

PCG: AND LEAVING ME DISTURBING NOTES.

PCG: I'M SURE OTHERS MUST BE DEAD BY NOW.

PCG: AND NOW SOLLUX IS BLIND AND I LOST TRACK OF HIM SOMEHOW.

PCG: I HEARD A STRAY HONK AND I RAN AND WE GOT SEPARATED AND

PCG: I'M STARTING TO THINK

PCG: THAT THIS MUST BE A DOOMED TIMELINE

PCG: THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH ANYONE

PCG: THEY MUST BE DROPPING LIKE BEHEMOTH LEAVINGS OUT THERE.

PCG: AND THAT MUST BE WHY

PCG: FUTURE KANAYA WAS TALKING IN THIS MEMO

PCG: BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD...

PCG: WHICH MAKES THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

PCG: IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.

PCG: GAMZEE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO GO CRAZY.

PCG: I THINK IF HE DOES

PCG: IT MEANS WE FUCKED SOMETHING UP.

PCG: IT MEANS *I* FUCKED SOMETHING UP.

PCG: HE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY, I HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE'S SAFE.

PCG: AND I DIDN'T DO THAT.

PCG: ONE TIME, ONE OF THE DOOMED ARADIAS TOLD ME SHE CAME FROM A TIME WHERE HE FLIPPED OUT AND KILLED EVERYBODY, BECAUSE OF MY FAILURE.

PCG: I DIDN'T TAKE HER SERIOUSLY, BUT I SHOULD HAVE.

PCG: SHE WAS CONSTANTLY FIXING MY FUCKUPS.

PCG: ROBOTS FROM THE FUTURE ALWAYS COMING BACK TO TELL ME HOW SOME HASTY SHIT I DID WITH FROG BREEDING OR WHATEVER WOULD MAKE IT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.

PCG: MY OWN PERSONAL MISTAKES PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE DOOMED ARADIABOTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

PCG: WHICH WAS SORT OF A SILVER LINING I GUESS? I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEATEN THE KING WITHOUT HER ARMY.

PCG: NOT THAT IT MATTERS ANYMORE.

PCG: I'VE OBVIOUSLY BECOME JUST ANOTHER GUY IN A DOOMED TIMELINE WATCHING EVERYONE AROUND HIM DIE.

PCG: I WAS JUST SITTING HERE WONDERING WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE WRONG THIS TIME

PCG: TO MAKE THE TIMELINE TAKE A WRONG TURN

PCG: AND PINPOINTING IT SEEMED OVERWHELMING SINCE I'VE MADE MORE TERRIBLE DECISIONS THAN I CAN EVEN COUNT.

PCG: BUT

PCG: I THINK LOOKING BACK

PCG: I KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW.
