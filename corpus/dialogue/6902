    <span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: THE WORST STORY THAT HAS EVER 8EEN TOLD IN THE HISTORY OF PARADOX SPACE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: whoa clam down</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: No! I will not &quot;clam down.&quot; Clamming is not something you can do, unless you do it UP, or you are literally retrieving clams from a 8ed of soft oceanic soil.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: clam your rumble spheres</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: seriously they is lookin lively girl everyones gawkin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You just have no respect for a well told story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i said what happened didnt i</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Only 8arely!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You left out so much! All the intrigue, the complicated interpersonal relationships, the 8ackstory, the responsi8le pacing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Where was the WORLD 8UILDING, Meenah?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: who gives a dolphin flip through a big ring of shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Ok! I think I finally understand the art of storytelling now, thanks to you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It turns out all you have to do is make series of short, mysterious statements without supplying context or any further ela8oration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's all so simple! Let's try it out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Did you know that &quot;what's his face&quot; Vantas in our post-scratch world grew up to 8e a spiritual leader followed 8y millions?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: They killed him though. He died handcuffed to something, while shouting a rude word. The end!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Leijon grew up to 8e his m8sprit! She wrote stuff down and spent a long time in a cave. That's that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Their 8uddy Captor flew a ship for some hag. It wasn't a very cool gig. Maryam found a wiggler and died a slave. Did I mention our planet 8ecame kind of a shithole? No, I don't think I did, 8ecause that's apparently not how you &quot;tell stories.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: go on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Zahhak 8uilt me a ro8otic arm. He was ordered 8y a high8lood to kill a girl 8ut he couldn't do it, and was 8anished. Really 8eat himself up over that. 8ut it's ok 8ecause his descendant redeemed the honor of his legacy 8y doing whatever a murderous clown told him to. Wait, was that too much detail? Forget I said some of that. Moving on!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Ampora was a pirate. No8ody liked him. He killed a lot of people, 8ut was later executed 8ecause he was una8le to tell a funny joke. What else needs to 8e said? That's right. Nothing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Makara was the guy who didn't like his joke. He was terri8le and so is his story. Period.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Nitram was a hero who led a re8ellion. He killed me. 8ut not 8efore things got pretty steamy 8etween us. Want to hear the juicy details? You're out of luck!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: aww man 38(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Pyrope cut off my arm and arrested me, 8ut I killed her. This triggered a karmic cycle of revenge which led to the eventual 8linding of her descendant.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Sorry, Terezi. Them's the 8r8ks!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008282">TEREZI: W41T</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008282">TEREZI: WH4T?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: As for me, well, I could go on ALL DAAAAAAAAY a8out that su8ject. 8ut I won't!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I was a cool pir8te. The 8est pir8! I lived a long time, had amazing adventures, got all the treasure, then died. That's all she wrote!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut not literally. She wrote quite a lot in fact. She had a lot to say, just like me. Which is why she's so gr8.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Let's see. Who am I forgetting here?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: uh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: ahem</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Oh, of course. Megido! Now there's an interesting story full of exciting twists and turns we won't 8e getting into.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She was kidnapped as a child 8y a creep, then served the creep's 8oss for millions of sweeps. She helped make everything lousy. Then you killed her and took her jo8.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Anyway, I think this tedious tale has gone on for entirely too long already!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I can't think of a single thing left to address that could possi8ly 8e of interest to anyone.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: no no shut up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: do me now what about me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: waterboat meeeee!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Why, Meenah. Could it 8e that you would like to hear more?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I must 8e imagining things, 8ecause you are on record as finding my stories 8oring.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: no these stories are more interesting than your usual ones</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: i can tell because im actually still a wake</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Very well. You would like to know a8out your post-scratch adult life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Would you like the short version? Or the long version?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: uh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: are those the only two options</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You tell me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: how about</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: but</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: dont leave out too much of the cool stuff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: shit man why do i gotta explain this to a presumably rational person</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: just tell me what ma junk was bitch!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Very well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I shall strive to convey your story, including details which you are likely to find interesting on account of vanity, whilst attempting to refrain from going &quot;Full Serket&quot; on you and other hapless 8ystanders.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: blub</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: come on spit it out windfang</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: no more adventures on the high breeze got it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You want the a8ridged-version, 8ut-may8e-not-so-a8ridged, as-long-as-the-stuff-that-you-in-particular-would-like-to-hear-is-included, of the Meenah Peixes saga?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Here we go.</span>
