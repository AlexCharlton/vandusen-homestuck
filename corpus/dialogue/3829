<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT YOU ARE ABOUT TO START PASSING OUT BUNNIES LIKE THEY'RE CHEAP CIGARS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMBARRASSING DISPLAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what are you talking about?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok...</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh... dang!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess i better get off this meteor then!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: TOO BAD, BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE SPARED YOU FROM MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF IN A COUPLE MINUTES, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, SPARED ME FROM HAVING TO WATCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, well you keep saying how doomed we are and how all this bad stuff happens sooner, but you never say why!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what happens in our game that's different from yours that makes things go so badly?</span>
