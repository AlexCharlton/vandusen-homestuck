CG: ARE YOU HAPPY.

EB: sure, i guess.

CG: YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.

CG: BUT YOU ARE ABOUT TO START PASSING OUT BUNNIES LIKE THEY'RE CHEAP CIGARS.

CG: IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMBARRASSING DISPLAY.

EB: what are you talking about?

CG: YEAH, EXACTLY, NUMSKULL.

CG: LET'S JUST HAVE OUR CHAT, THEN IT CAN NATURALLY OCCUR TO YOU TO BE AN IDIOT IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME.

EB: ok...

EB: i was sort of mulling it over while looking at all these babies with guns and sitting on ponies and things...

EB: and how the reckoning takes them back.

EB: and how you said our reckoning starts sooner.

CG: YEAH.

EB: are you sure it has to start so soon? can't we delay it?

CG: HAHAHAHA.

CG: IT STARTS IN A FEW MINUTES STUPID.

CG: SEE THAT COUNTDOWN CLOCK OVER THERE?

CG: YOU AREN'T DELAYING ANYTHING.

EB: oh... dang!

EB: i guess i better get off this meteor then!

CG: WELL I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE.

CG: FIRST SOME SMALLER METEORS GO.

CG: THEN BIGGER ONES.

CG: SPREAD OUT OVER LIKE 24 HOURS OR SO.

CG: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE...

CG: GO TIME.

CG: WHEN IT STARTS.

CG: LIKE IT'S TIME TO HURRY UP AND STOP FUCKING AROUND AND KILL THE BOSS, GET IT?

CG: THE ROCK YOU'RE ON DOESN'T BLAST OFF RIGHT AWAY.

CG: TOO BAD, BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE SPARED YOU FROM MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF IN A COUPLE MINUTES, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, SPARED ME FROM HAVING TO WATCH.

EB: ok, well you keep saying how doomed we are and how all this bad stuff happens sooner, but you never say why!

EB: what happens in our game that's different from yours that makes things go so badly?

CG: JACK NOIR.
