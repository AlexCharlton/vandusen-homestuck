<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know that there is a deal with it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Beyond the deal you just described.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is what it sounds like.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: A huge sun out in the literal middle of nowhere, and it is bright green.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is simply,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/greensun.gif" border="0" />.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: how big</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i need a sense of scale here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: is it like the size of our sun</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or bigger</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or is it only as big as like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: planet fucking jupiter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok thats pretty fucking big</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Happy I could help.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so ok i make a map to this thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and then i guess we go there for some reason</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why do we need a map</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: cant they just</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: tell us what direction its in</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: point a spaceship that way</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: blast off to adventure</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The geometry of the Furthest Ring is too complex.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Remember, its spacetime is labyrinthine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: In fact, it's not really accurate to call it spacetime at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Since it is outside the domain of any created universe, where those properties have become instantiated and stabilized.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i can kind of get that time is messed up there</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: being the knight of time here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: space isnt my thing remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what is it like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: full of wormholes or something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It depends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Time and space aren't as different as you might think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think it means I'm supposed to know shit about the big picture.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which includes tidbits like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But the insides of my shoes stay free from the grit of the minutia.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: fair enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i take my map and fly to this thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No, I do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok you fly to it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: then what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That depends on if John is successful.</span>
