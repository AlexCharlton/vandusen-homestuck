GA: Why Is It That When The Subject Of Temporal Mechanics Is Broached Your Sparing Human Intellects Instantly Assume The Most Ingratiating Posture Of Surrender Imaginable

GA: Time Is Not That Difficult To Understand

GA: It Is A Utility That A Universe May Resort To In Order To Advance A Desired Degree Of Complexity

GA: Or May Not Resort To If That Is The Case

GA: Its All Pretty Pedestrian

GA: But No 

GA: When Time Travel Comes Up You Present The Face That A Man Shows When The Breeze Gradually Alerts Him To His Absence Of Netherdressings

GA: I Dont See How We Are To Properly Agitate You All If You Continue To Insist On Failing To Understand Basic Concepts Which Common Infants Effortlessly Manage To Describe Via Scrawlings In Their Own Puddles Of Sloppy Discharge

TT: Have we spoken before?

GA: Yes 

GA: In The Future

TT: You and your friends never cease to invent ways to strengthen the credibility of your assertions.

GA: Oh My It Is Your Human Sarcasm Again

GA: I Enjoy Listening To It And I Wish Doing So Could Serve As My Primary Form Of Recreation

GA: There See I Just Did It Too

GA: Saying The Opposite Thing To Emphasize My Contempt

GA: But Suddenly I Feel More Primitive And Hate Myself A Little More

GA: It Was Like This Funny Miracle That Just Happened In My Heart

TT: I would admire the sophistication of you and your fellow future-dwellers a little more if you seemed to be aware the word "human" only functions as that sort of adjective in bad science fiction.

TT: But I won't be rude and change the subject.

TT: There's a still a bit of unflagellated straw poking out of your rhetorical effigy over here.

GA: Oh Dear

GA: No We Arent From "The Future"

GA: But We Are All Already In Agreement That You Dont Get It And Never Will

TT: I thought you said we spoke in the future.

GA: We Did

GA: Your Future

GA: For Me It Was Only A Couple Minutes Ago

TT: I understand.

TT: You exist in some temporal stratum through which you have communication access to various points of my timeline.

TT: It's not that complicated.

GA: Yes Thats Right

GA: Will You Try To Talk Some Sense Into Your Idiot Friends

GA: So That We May Proceed To Bother Them All On More Rational Terms

TT: I try to every day, with mixed results.

TT: But you see, it's not that I don't understand you.

TT: It's just that I don't believe you.

TT: Because it's nonsense.

TT: Albeit persistent and coordinated nonsense.

TT: Why would a bunch of temporally dislocated trolls want to harass a group of friends throughout completely random points in time?

GA: I Will Admit This Campaign Of Provocation Wasnt All That Well Thought Out

GA: Dont Tell Anyone I Said That

TT: Alright.

TT: Maybe you should get some trolling tips from us humans.

TT: Our sparing intellects are probably better suited to it.

GA: Yeah Maybe

GA: Why Dont We Be Friends

TT: You want to be my friend?

GA: I Think So

GA: I Think Were Supposed To

GA: You Suggested As Much Earlier

TT: You mean I did in the future?

GA: Yes A Couple Minutes Ago

TT: Probably because I remembered you mentioning it in the conversation we're having now?

GA: Thats Likely

TT: Hmm.

TT: Your commitment to this roleplaying scenario is intriguing.

TT: What choice do I have but to accept?
