EB: karkat!!!

EB: hey buddy, you were making me worried there...

EB: are you ok?

CG: WHAT IN THE NAME OF SWEET GLOBE TICKLING FUCK.

CG: EGBERT, I JUST GOT DONE ERUPTING A WHOLE VOLCANO OF MERCILESS FUCK YOU ON THE PRIMITIVE VILLAGE LOCATED SQUARELY ON YOUR CROTCH.

CG: ASSUMING THAT'S A SUITABLY TERRIBLE PART OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR A VILLAGE IN JEOPARDY TO EXIST.

EB: errr...

CG: SHUT UP. HOW DARE YOU CONTACT ME WHILE I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKWARDS MARCH OF HATE THROUGH YOUR TEDIOUS TIMELINE.

EB: oh god, this is not right!

EB: you aren't supposed to hate me anymore, you're supposed to be kinda my friend, sorta!

EB: when is this?

CG: WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN IS THIS

CG: OK, LET ME JUST CHECK THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK WHICH KEEPS CONSISTENT TIME FOR ALL FRAMES OF REFERENCE AND ALL PLANES OF REALITY.

CG: IT'S HALF PAST YOU'RE A MORON.

EB: ok, duh! i know that.

EB: i mean, how many times have you talked to me before?

CG: WE JUST GOT DONE WITH OUR SECOND CONVERSATION. HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THIS?

EB: AUGH!

EB: this isn't good, i need to talk to future you!

CG: WHY

EB: because it sounds like you're in trouble.

EB: i think maybe you are running from jack?

CG: OF COURSE WE'RE RUNNING FROM JACK, I JUST GOT DONE FUCKING TELLING YOU THAT.

EB: no, i know, but...

EB: *SIGN*

CG: I GUESS MY FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WILL INSTIGATE SOME MISGUIDED NEED FOR YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME LATER ON.

CG: WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO HERE.

CG: I SWEAR, IT NEVER ENDS WITH THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE SHIT. EVEN AFTER THE GAME IS OVER.

CG: EVEN AFTER YOU LOSE IT! HOW UNFAIR IS THAT.

EB: ultimate riddle shit?

CG: I CAN TELL THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE A UTTER FUCKING JOY TO PARTICIPATE IN.

CG: I HONESTLY ENVY ANYONE IN THE POSITION OF NOT HAVING TO PUT UP WITH READING IT.

CG: BUT YOU ASKED FOR IT, JOHN, SO HERE WE GO.

CG: ARE YOU READY

EB: no, i just want to talk to future you. :(

CG: NO YOU DON'T

CG: TAKE IT FROM ME

CG: THE GUY IS A BASTARD.
