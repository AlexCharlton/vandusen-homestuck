<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we are not a social race. we generally will not ever encoUnter another of oUr kind, Unless it is time to mate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and when that time comes, oUr coUrtship is nothing like it is for hUmans.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i was so daft, i thoUght skaia had actUally made an exception for Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and that we coUld overcome oUr conflicts, work together, and fUlfill the game's minimUm reqUirement of two players. one of space and the other of time.</span>
<br />
