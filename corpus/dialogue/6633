    <span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its hard to explain</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: just some slight differences in personality i guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he still raps sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yes...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just thought i would mention that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ok i will admit i cant really tell if his rapping style has changed</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: trust me, it hasn't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: or because he lived for a while in a different timeline...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, weren't you a sprite before?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how different did you feel then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i wasnt a sprite!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: my dead dream self was a sprite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and then i kind of merged with her when i became a god tier</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh, right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: half of you was a sprite.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its more like im still the me i always was, but inherited some of her memories</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but they are pretty vague</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: do you remember what it was like being jade sprite?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i remember being dead for a long time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and making friends...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: mostly trolls</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which ones?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: none that we know of now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that i can remember at least</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: they feel like such distant memories, like they were barely real</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i have to admit, i am a little disappointed in the dream bubble thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: by the way you were describing it, i really thought we would dream about them on this trip more often!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yeah me too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: maybe its something about this place were traveling through?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i dunno.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: when was the last time you visited one in your sleep?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: man...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that was weeks ago, i think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and then, when i do dream about them, it's just kind of weird.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: either i'm alone in my own memory, talking to figments of my imagination...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: or i dream about someone we know. like a troll we have talked to, and i get excited.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but then it turns out they don't know who i am! it's like a version of them that died before they ever even knew us, and it's just kind of awkward.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yup</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and i still haven't seen dave or rose AT ALL.</span>
