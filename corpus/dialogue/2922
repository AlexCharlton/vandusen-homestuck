EB: just keep the safe or tub handy or something.

EB: it'll serve them right for trashing my posters.

TT: I keep telling you the posters were always like that.

EB: AND I KEEP TELLING YOU HA HA VERY FUNNY

TT: Here, look.

EB: yeah, i saw those, but...

EB: they didn't look like that before. you must have changed them.

TT: Even if I had the motive for such a bizarre and pointless deception, where would I find the time?

TT: I don't even have Photoshop.

EB: then why didn't you TELL me they were there???

TT: I had no reason to think you were not aware of them.

TT: I thought they were strange, certainly, but was not struck by any particular impulse to discuss them.

EB: ok, it still doesn't make sense though.

EB: implying that i drew them a while ago and then forgot and couldn't see them and now suddenly see them.

EB: that's stupid, what would that even mean.
