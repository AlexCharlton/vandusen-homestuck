EB: and then climb the god tiers, i guess?

AG: Yes, exactly! Pretty exciting, isn't it?

EB: yeah...

EB: maybe it is a little TOO exciting.

AG: What's that mean?

EB: i am not sleepy at all!

EB: also, this is not much of a bed. more like a really hard slab of rock.

EB: i don't see how i will be able to sleep.

AG: John.

AG: Would you like me to put you to sleep?

EB: um...

EB: you mean, you're asking me this time, instead of just doing it?

EB: what happened to you wanting to be responsible for me becoming a hero!

AG: John, I am clearly involved in your rise to power now regardless. That can't 8e changed!

AG: I am giving you the option, 8ecause at some point a hero has to start making choices.

AG: Once you take a 8r8k from hunting treasure and stop getting distracted 8y side quests, you eventually realize that's what this game is all a8out.

AG: The choices you make affect the destiny of the universe you cre8te, as well as the type of hero you 8ecome.

AG: It would have 8een nice if someone was around to explain all this to me, and let me have some control over my own f8.

AG: I had to do this a much less pleasant way. I'm sparing you that indignity.

AG: 8esides, it's not like you're some loser who doesn't know how to make tough decisions.

AG: So what'll it 8e, John?

EB: well...

EB: i'm supposed to go to sleep to realize my destiny...

EB: and you have the ability to make me do that, so...

EB: i don't really see the harm in that.

EB: it sounds like it is just the practical thing to do.

AG: Am I hearing a "yes," John?

EB: yes, that is my decision.

EB: vriska, please put me to sleep!

AG: You got it. <3
