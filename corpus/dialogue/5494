TA: what d0 y0u mean why we are all here?

TA: y0u mean in the afterlife? that's easy.

TA: because she's asleep, she's dead, y0u're alive, and i'm blind, c0uldn't be simpler.

AA: no no

AA: not why we are in this bubble now

AA: but why we all exist in the first place and why we all went on this adventure together

TA: 0h, that.

AA: there is much to understand and i believe it all begins with one sequence of events

AA: watching will help those whove passed to understand the purpose of their sacrifice and those still living to understand what must be done to complete the journey still ahead

AA: we will let the memories lead the way

AA: are you guys ready?
