    <span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, like I said. She was raised by the Baroness. It was probably a worse childhood than either of us had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She wasn't related obviously. Ain't nobody's related to a damn fish alien. Except other fish aliens probably.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She had an adoptive brother too. Life must have been miserable for both of them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes i vaguely remember her mentioning him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Cripes the things she told me now that i think about it. She said the witch even killed her dog!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is that true?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know, but wouldn't doubt it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are other urban legends that she did a lot of experiments on animals and people. Mostly to do with mind control.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like figuring out ways to unlock all of her psychic alien potential, to increase her power.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not sure if that's true, or if it was actually successful though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So what youre saying is pretty much any unspeakably horrible thing she could have done she probably did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, your grandma managed to run away when she was quite young. Maybe it was a traumatic event like dog murder that prompted her to flee, who knows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Whatever the case, her bro stayed behind. The guy must have been seriously immune to witnessing fucked up shit, because he went on to be a famous comedian. A real kindly old cornball. A nicer guy you couldn't hope to meet, they say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Haha wow. Must have been a hell of a guy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're not making any connections there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where? Huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Famous comedian, about the age of your grandma, inheriting the family name of the Baroness...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not ringing a bell?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What are you talking about! Dirk stop speaking in riddles and keep telling the story i am on tenterhooks here!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, well it's not like it's that important. Just a super obvious thing that'll probably occur to you later when you're looking in the fridge you don't have, at which point you'll feel like an idiot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh my god you can be one opaque motherfucker just clue me in bro!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah, it'll be funnier this way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Moving on.</span>
