GC: OR 1 M34N...

GC: NOT L1V1NG

AG: It has 8een a very long time.

AG: So long, time has 8een stripped of the meaning it never really had in the first place.

AG: It doesn't really pass in the same way it does when you're alive. Concepts like "now" and "how long" are figures of speech used to make communication simpler.

AG: I've quit trying to give expression to the elusive temporal properties of this place. It's easier staying conversational.

AG: 8ut I will say that 8eing here "for so long" lends itself to a certain detachment from what you see. Otherwise, monitoring the atrocities stemming from our failure wouldn't 8e much fun.

GC: DO YOU M1SS YOUR WORLD 4S MUCH 4S 1 DO?

AG: Yes, sometimes.

AG: 8ut missing it usually invites memories of home to serve as the stage.

AG: Not that it's a su8stitute for the previous reality. 8ut the reminders of home are everywhere.

GC: WH4T 4BOUT YOUR FR13NDS? 1 GU3SS YOU ST1LL G3T TO H4NG OUT W1TH TH3M 4LL?

AG: Yes. I see them often enough.

AG: Except for one, whom I haven't seen at all since 8efore we all died.

AG: In fact, she's the only reason we are here in the first place, as opposed to merely ceasing to exist upon the scratch.

AG: In life, she was the only one I would have called a close friend, in a way.

AG: The thing is, no8ody liked her much either. We had that in common. ::::)

GC: WOW, 1TS B33N TH4T LONG S1NC3 YOU S4W H3R?

AG: Remem8er how I said the gods could keep you dancing around someone you're looking for indefinitely?

GC: Y34H BUT...

GC: B1LL1ONS OF SW33PS??

AG: Well, "8illions," yes. In a manner of speaking.

GC: 1S SH3 BY 4NY CH4NC3 TH3 TROUBL3M4K3R YOU W3R3 T4LK1NG 4BOUT?

AG: That's right. In fact, we are on our way to visit her now.

GC: OH

GC: SO TH4TS WH3R3 TH1S BR4NCH 1S T4K1NG US!

AG: Notice the moon up there?

AG: And not the larger green interloper. That one never 8elonged to my world. It is your memory, not mine.

GC: Y34H TH3 CUT3 L1TTL3 BUBBL3GUM MOONS! TH4TS WH3R3 SH3 1S?

AG: It's the setting of the memory she entered.

AG: From her perspective, she has just arrived here.

AG: Your friends should 8e joining us too, 8efore your meteor clears the 8u88le.

AG: May8e together we can 8ring the Thief of Life up to speed.
