<br />
<span style="color: #008282">GC: NOT L1V1NG</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It has 8een a very long time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So long, time has 8een stripped of the meaning it never really had in the first place.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It doesn't really pass in the same way it does when you're alive. Concepts like &quot;now&quot; and &quot;how long&quot; are figures of speech used to make communication simpler.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I've quit trying to give expression to the elusive temporal properties of this place. It's easier staying conversational.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I will say that 8eing here &quot;for so long&quot; lends itself to a certain detachment from what you see. Otherwise, monitoring the atrocities stemming from our failure wouldn't 8e much fun.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008282">GC: DO YOU M1SS YOUR WORLD 4S MUCH 4S 1 DO?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut missing it usually invites memories of home to serve as the stage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not that it's a su8stitute for the previous reality. 8ut the reminders of home are everywhere.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Except for one, whom I haven't seen at all since 8efore we all died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In fact, she's the only reason we are here in the first place, as opposed to merely ceasing to exist upon the scratch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In life, she was the only one I would have called a close friend, in a way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The thing is, no8ody liked her much either. We had that in common. ::::)</span>
