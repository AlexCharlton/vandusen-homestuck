<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she started helping me after she tried to kill me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Ugh. She is still trying to one up me I see. Even preempting my awesome helpfulness!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When did she do that? I mean from my perspective? Do you think she already did it, or hasn't done it yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, how could i possibly know that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't know. Forget it.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why do you want to be so helpful, anyway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, with her i got the sense she was being kind of jokestery about it, which is something i can understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but why bother helping, if we aren't going to win anyway?</span>
<br />
