AG: So you can get 8ack to your computer. Here, hang on, I am making you a map.

EB: but i know where i'm going!

EB: terezi already made me a map.

AG: What!!!!!!!!

EB: first she made a really crappy one, then a really nice one that works kind of like google.

EB: she started helping me after she tried to kill me.

AG: Ugh. She is still trying to one up me I see. Even preempting my awesome helpfulness!

AG: When did she do that? I mean from my perspective? Do you think she already did it, or hasn't done it yet?

EB: wow, how could i possibly know that!

AG: I don't know. Forget it.

AG: I will show her though. I will show her the meaning of helpfulness.

AG: I will help this little human nerd under the ta8le. The very same ta8le you dined at, while I w8ted on you prong and fucking nu8.

EB: you mean like a candle light hate date?

AG: God, no!!!!!!!! With a human? Gross.

EB: oh...

EB: well then, thanks, i guess?

EB: why do you want to be so helpful, anyway?

EB: i mean, with her i got the sense she was being kind of jokestery about it, which is something i can understand.

EB: but why bother helping, if we aren't going to win anyway?

AG: You won't win? Says who?????????

EB: you guys.

EB: it is practically all you ever say.

AG: Well, ok yes, you are screwed. And so are we.

AG: 8ut so what!

AG: Just 8ecause you are going to fail doesn't mean it won't 8e any fun along the way!

AG: 8y the looks of things, you have a very exciting 24 hours ahead of you.

AG: It'll 8e one hell of a reckoning!
