TG: you mean the jumper block thing

GG: no no weve got enough for that.....

GG: but its still pretty expensive

TG: wait what

TG: the thing costs 1000 for me

GG: yeah me too!

GG: and we have 2000 to work with

GG: ok 1998 ._.

TG: what

TG: man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world

TG: what the hell

GG: ohhh...

GG: how much did rose start with? when she was playing with john?

TG: hang on ill ask

GG: k

TG: she says 20

GG: i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection!

TG: yeah

TG: so i guess you can buy everything now

GG: no!!!!

GG: i cant buy the holopad thingy and the intellibeam laserstation

TG: ok now i know youre making this shit up

GG: hahahaha no theyre right here!

GG: they cost a fortune

TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples

TG: and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on

TG: oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now

GG: yeah ive got that too!

GG: i will deploy it

TG: so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced

GG: yes i think that is how it works

GG: when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!

TG: hey look we're learning stuff
