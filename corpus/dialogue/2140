EB: hurry up and open my door!!!!!!

EB: not that it even matters, i think i'm probably dead no matter what!!!!!!

TT: Patience. You still haven't used the new totem.

EB: ???

TT: I believe it will create the item on the punch card.

EB: so what is it, like an apple or something?

EB: what good will that even do?

TT: We'll see.

TT: I've found no evidence that anyone has successfully created the item.

TT: And the content of the card appears to be variable from session to session.

TT: In one instance it was described as an "eggy loking thign" [sic].

EB: do we have enough of those building jewels to make it?

TT: According to the Atheneum, it is a free item.

TT: This speaks to its importance, in my view.

TT: Now off you go.
