EB: yeah.

TT: And how did it make you feel to discover what was in there?

EB: oh no, i just realized!

EB: you are going to psycho-therapify me.

EB: well don't bother!

TT: Maybe I am just being a friend?

EB: maybe...

EB: /EYES SUSPSICIOSLY

EB: anyway i guess you saw what's in there, it's boring and there's not much to even see.

TT: That doesn't matter.

TT: What matters is how seeing it affected you.

TT: I think it clearly has in some way.

EB: well...

EB: i don't know, at first i was nervous to go in and find more of his weird clowns, because of course they are stupid and i hate them a lot.

EB: but then when i didn't see any, it was weird.

EB: i felt weirdly, like... disappointed almost.

TT: Is it fair to say this changed your perception of your father?

EB: yeah, i guess.

TT: Is it such a stretch to conclude it changed your perception of other things as well?

EB: uh no, maybe not.

EB: but what are you getting at?

EB: it sounds like you're saying i'm crazy!
