    <span style="color: #929292">uranianUmbra [UU]</span> began cheering <span style="color: #ff6ff2">tipsyGnostalgic [TG]</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: there yoU are!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: tricky one to track down, yoU are. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh yeh&gt;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dunno why i been right here goofin around for hours</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh no doUbt!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: methinks it has less to do with yoUr actUal whereaboUts as it does with yoUr virtUes as a hero of void.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok but you never say what stuff like that means when you say it tho</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is this more casual spoilerz shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: caUsal! and yes, somewhat. however...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: with these spoilers, by their natUre, the more time that passes for yoU the less relevant it becomes to gUard their secrecy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as yoU approach yoUr entry, details i have obscUred will become more plainly evident.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so i see no harm in loosening my tongUe on certain matters the closer yoU get to the appointed hoUr! ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so ur saying i have like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: these magical void powers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: sounds like kinda shitty and boring powers to me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what can they even do besise make me invisible to an anien sometimes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *alien</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the void aspect is fascinating, thoUgh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: its heroes preside over the essence of lack, or nothingness. the obfUscation of knowledge, or its oUtright destrUction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: SNOOOZE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well, *i* think it is wonderfUl. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and anyway, one can hardly draw many conclUsions aboUt a player by aspect alone.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the aspect is channeled more specifically by the assets of ones class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so when u cant see me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: when im doin my voidey thing or w/e</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what do you see is it just a black screen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: pretty mUch! :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hmmmmm,..</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: hmmmmm?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its just that footage of my mom does that too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like blacks out and stuff</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: mom was a notoirious scourge to the papayazzi</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or i mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the womom who im supposed to be genetically descended from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *womam</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: know what i mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i Understand what yoU're getting at, yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is certainly possible that we may have common groUnd with oUr ancestors when it comes to oUr aspects, and the way oUr abilities reveal themselves to Us. i coUld not rUle this oUt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt there is always more to examine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for instance, a hero of life and a hero of doom have aspects as different as can be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt if their classes are different enoUgh as well, that is, one active and the other passive, remarkably there is a chance they coUld end Up with very similar abilities!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: player abilities may also manifest in ways in defiance with their aspects if they are heavily resistant to their trUe calling. or, if corrUpted in some way by an oUtside inflUence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it is rather clear to me yoU are one who embraces her aspect qUite heartily, even if yoU are not aware of it. ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: deep down i am super psyched about nothigness</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah souns about right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh damn hey</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i almost forgot i had a really short but cool dream i fugured you might like this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh yes, everyone is having important dreams as we near oUr mUtUal entries. this is lovely!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: please tell.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i saw someone i think was supposed to be my daughter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: do you know if thats true</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: can yoU describe her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well she looked kinda like me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but in this orange getunp</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: w a yellow sun on it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: she soUnds to me like the well known figUre of legend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: or at least, well known to those who make the stUdy of sUch matters into their all consUming pastime. ~_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believe yoU saw the seer of light.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so ok</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it woUld normally be my instinct to sUpply a vagUe response here...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i think that yoUr heart has already told yoU the answer, and as sUch my secrecy woUld be pUrposeless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so, yes, that she was!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: smh</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *signs deeply muttering LALIENS to self*</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: k im sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU are really cUrioUs aboUt the events sUrroUnding yoUr daUghter's origin, yoU can always ask her in person when yoU meet her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so you mean</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: there is so mUch for me to keep track of, and it gets very difficUlt to remember what information to reveal at what time when yoU are flUstered.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok so without pushin and flustratin you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: lemme just see if i have all my facts right</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and the game will let me resurrect her from the dead and thats what im gonna do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the game provides a mechanism for the revival of the deceased, yes. it is called a kernelsprite, and yoU are free to gather remains of any dead party yoU choose, to revive that individUal in the form of a sprite. the sprite will then serve as a helpfUl spirit gUide on yoUr joUrney!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah but you cleverly dodged the q</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thats how u say it works but WILL i do that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believe i was very forthright in my answer!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just like i descended from my mom through some sort of simimar bio process</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: those are...</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: silly &amp; cute &amp; bad @ lyin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i really don't lie!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am not deceitfUl by natUre bUt in order to protect the integrity of certain oUtcomes while still being helpfUl to yoU, i gUess i am learning the art of deception throUgh honesty?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: which as it tUrns oUt, as well intended as it may be, still comes across to a savvy lass like yoUrself as jUst another kind of eqUivocation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh i gUess i shoUldn't be so startled that a rogUe of void coUld bewilder me so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: void players are said in texts to have a way with flUmmoxing even those with plans beyond mortal Understanding.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and i'm far from anyone like that. jUst a girl who wants to help!</span>
