<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: poor, sweet, dear, precious fefeta :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is not fefeta!!!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: since none of yoU have any dream selves left, it won't do any good to sacrifice yoUrselves on the qUest beds foUnd on yoUr respective planets.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and even if yoU did, there is not even a battlefield from which to rise anew. no, yoUr void session had only one path to ascension all along.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU mUst travel to the centre of the moons of prospit and derse, and there in the crypt yoU will find yoUr sacrificial slabs. yoU mUst lie on them, and then...</span>
