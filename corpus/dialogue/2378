EB: :C

TT: Sorry.

TT: No nuance to these controls at all.

TT: I was hoping to bludgeon the imp without letting go of it. Guess I can't really do that.

TT: A broken piano isn't the end of the world though.

EB: i guess you're right.

TT: You'll need to pick up the spoils in person. I can't interact with the grist.

EB: so...

EB: that means i have to go out the back door?

TT: Yes. Is there a problem?

EB: well it may sound dumb, but i was hoping to avoid nanna and her spooky ghost cookies.

TT: You're right, that does sound dumb.

EB: can you see her in the kitchen? 

TT: Yeah.

EB: what's she doing, is she baking?

TT: You could say that.

EB: are you SURE you can't get that grist up to me somehow?

TT: Maybe.
