<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: among them was to begin guzzling untold liters of that putrid circus cola</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: think of it as like a rite of passage</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like something that just goes with the territory when someone you know almost imperceptibly begins turning into a juggalo</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: wait fuck</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: maybe she does need an intervention</span>
