EB: omg, karkat. it is like your shitty shipping grid is coming true before our very eyes.

EB: haha, remember when you made that ugly thing?

CG: HE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE, AND MET WITH ROSE.

CG: THAT WAS THE END OF THE LINE FOR ALPHA DAVE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, HE DOESN'T TIME TRAVEL AFTER THAT, AND HE AND ROSE STAY ON DERSE WAITING FOR THE BOMB UNTIL YOU START THE SCRATCH.

CG: WHEN HE DOES, EITHER HE OR ROSE WILL DELIVER THE BOMB.

CG: I DON'T KNOW WHICH.
