uu: YES. THAT'S uNBELIEVABLY DuMB TO ASK.

TT: Like, you don't mind telling me I'm about to pick up Cal, and thus causing that to happen.

TT: So I guess you similarly wouldn't mind telling us about more significant outcomes?

uu: IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T MIND. IT'S THAT I FAIL SPECTACuLARLY TO GIVE A SHIT.

uu: THERE IS SuCH A BIG DIFFERENCE.

uu: AND THE FACT THAT I MIGHT NOT CLuE YOu INTO YOuR FATE ALL THE TIME.

uu: DuE TO MY AGGRAVATED APATHY OVER THE MATTER.

uu: IS AN IMMuTABLE FACT. I AM STATING FOR THE RECORD.

uu: IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT GIVING A SHIT IS WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE.

TT: I feel like you've said something like that before.

TT: Different statements, but in that exact syntax.

uu: OH. YOu KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE?

uu: WHEN THAT FuCKING HAPPENS.

TT: Wait. You mean it wasn't intentional?

TT: I thought it was kind of like... this thing you were doing.

uu: SHuT uP.

uu: YOu KNOW WHAT?

uu: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I DON'T CARE.

uu: I THINK IT'S REGRETTABLY LIKELY. THAT YOu SuCCEED.

uu: I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO DO. WHEN THEY ARE REGARDED AS LEGENDS BY OBSESSIVE ASSHOLES.

uu: SO MAYBE YOu ALL DIE. OR MAYBE YOu DON'T.

uu: BuT IF YOu DON'T. I'LL TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT.

uu: THAT IT MEANS I STILL GET THE CHANCE TO KILL YOu.

uu: HOW ABOuT THAT? FOR CAuSAL SPOILERS?

TT: Fair enough.

TT: Hey, you know...

TT: For someone who has such strong opinions about long winded people,

TT: You've kinda been talking my ear off. I do actually have shit to do.

uu: uGH.

uu: YEAH.

uu: SEE HOW YOu PEOPLE SuCK ME INTO YOuR BuLLSHIT?

uu: I SHOuLD HAVE KEPT IT BRIEF. AND SuRLY. LIKE I WAS GOING TO.

uu: LIKE JuST SAID.

uu: "HELLO DIRK."

uu: "I WANT TO PLAY A GAME."

uu: AND THEN LIKE.

uu: "BRO."

uu: "ROOF. NOW."

uu: "BRING JuJu."

uu: AND THAT'S IT.

uu: YEAH. THAT WOuLD HAVE BEEN GOOD.

uu: COLD FuCKING BLOODED. TO THE POINT. DAMMIT.

TT: That actually sounds familiar too.

TT: Are you sure you haven't said something like that before?

uu: HAVE I?

uu: FuCK. I DON'T KNOW. WHATEVER.

TT: Anyway, let's wrap this up.

TT: You've stolen enough of my time. I didn't even get a chance to try plugging in that window.

uu: I DID YOu A FAVOR. ANOTHER POINTLESS ACTION STRICKEN FROM THE TIMELINE.

TT: Hang on.

TT: Something's happening.
