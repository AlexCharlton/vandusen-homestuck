<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt yoU will be ready to deliver the package today, yes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im determined as ever to see this through. But as usual events have conspired to make a boondoggle of the prospect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think i might be fucked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: how so???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Terry needs fuel and i dont have any left. I think im at striders dubious mercy for a solution YET AGAIN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I will have to ask him for help. And soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well there yoU go, love! better hop to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes i will.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But also...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Theres the matter of the rabbits armaments.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont imagine hell do a lot of friggin good in helping grandfather crocker from kicking the old bucket without them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Did you not say youd supply these?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i did indeed say so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and have already done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You did??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in yoUr fUtUre.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i relayed the information enabling yoU to create the powerfUl weaponry yoUrself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and yoU did!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU then sent them back in time. yoU may recover them in the rUins, which conveniently is where yoU mUst go to ship the package once and for all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bangUp plan we hatched, dont yoU fancy? ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I see...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes it sure is if that is the case.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Then all thats left to do is find power for it...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh and also enough power for the stupid transmateriabob. Augh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So much to do before shuttling this goddamn thing into the past.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I mean...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That is what im doing right? Giving it to my grandma when she was a kid growing up on the same island i did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is somewhat close to the trUth, and i can see how yoU woUld draw that conclUsion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt theres more to it yoU dont Understand yet! yoU will sort it all oUt in time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: These are among the dadblasted causal spoilers you refuse to dish out?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: somewhat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it woUldnt hUrt yoU mUch to know the trUth, i imagine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: its jUst the trUth is a wee bit complicated.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: perhaps a draft of the cascading seqUence from which yoUr reality has arisen will pUt yoUr mind at ease.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: imagine two Universes, A and B.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now imagine there are two instances of each Universe, A1 and A2 and B1 and B2.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the first instance of each is like a test rUn, that does not qUite sUcceed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the second instance thoUgh will meet all of its pUrposes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now consider that A1 begets A2.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: A2 begets B1.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and B1 begets B2.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and the participants of B2 are the ones who will make an effort to exit all this tUrbUlence and falderal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU are one of them! :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and yoUr yoUng ancestor is another, thoUgh she is &quot;presently&quot; stationed in B1.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and yes she is in the past.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh not qUite as far as yoU believe!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: nor does she occUpy the same stream of continUity.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not sure i completely followed that but ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thats the best i can do for now. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: primarily becaUse i will not risk wasting mUch more of yoUr time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you are still in contention that i will meet our elders as youths?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh yes! ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ah ha! Then i WILL be traveling through time. I knew it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Or... they will be. Whichever it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Which is it, btw?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: caUsal spoilers, sir english!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fffff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: given the natUre of the qUest waiting for yoU, it woUldnt be shrewd of me to rUle oUt the employment of time travel by any individUal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i will say that yoUre probably prey to a basic misapprehension aboUt the natUre of this rendezvoUs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it will not take place on earth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it will happen inside the game yoUre aboUt to play!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well shit!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: indeed. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This is frightfully exciting. I would love to meet them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I never got to know my grandma very well and it always seemed like she led an amazing and adventurous life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Then this seemed to be proven true in my correspondence with her. So im really looking forward to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so trUe. id pay a hefty ransom to get to know my forebears.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I remember you mentioned your race doesnt really jive with ours familially speaking?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: correct. i never knew those who one woUld identify as my parental eqUivalents. U_U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is in the way my race propagates. oUr ancestors precede Us by millenia.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yes ours do too. But generally we have all these other people in between them and the most recent ones are called parents.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: so i guess you do not have those? Like systemically?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: nope! never did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: well neither did i!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Miss alien i think we are like birds of a feather you and i.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When do i get to learn your name by the way?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: hm trUthfUlly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it may be for the best that yoU never know it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it coUld stir Up some things best left in their present eqUilibriUm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and now i think i shoUld bollocks off and leave yoU to it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There are still some things id like to know!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: About today! About this game!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no more procrastinating!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just please tell me in the least causally spoilery way possible...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What are we even trying to accomplish here? What is even the rootin tootin POINT of this game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think yoU will have more fUn than yoU can imagine finding oUt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt stated concisely, and short of spoilerly as yoU so charmingly pUt it,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoUr objective today is to pave the way for the arrival of gods.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: &lt;kisses!&gt;</span>
