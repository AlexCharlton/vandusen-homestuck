GG: im a hypocrite :(

CG: NOT REALLY

CG: IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE A SANE RATIONAL PERSON, AND THERE JUST MIGHT BE HOPE FOR YOU YET

GG: wait...

GG: so me arguing with my dead dream self

GG: and smacking her around while screaming at her

GG: makes me SANE???

CG: YES, ABSOLUTELY.

CG: IT MEANS ALL OF YOUR HIDEOUS FLAWS DISGUST YOU.

CG: YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE DISGUSTED, IT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN SAY FOR THEMSELVES.

CG: REALLY, CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

GG: hahaha, wow

GG: you are so weird

CG: CONGRATULATIONS, IN ADDITION TO, JUST MAYBE, AN APOLOGY.

CG: DON'T YOU THINK?

GG: you want me to apologize?!

GG: for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself???

CG: WOULD IT REALLY KILL YOU TO CONSIDER IT?

GG: after taking so much crap from you for all those years?

GG: no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT

CG: DEAD DREAM DOG JADE, IS THAT YOU??? YOU'RE SOUNDING A BIT HYSTERICAL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALM DOWN.

GG: shut uuuup!!!

CG: WELL IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO GET YOUR ANEURYSM UNDER CONTROL

CG: MAYBE YOU WILL REALIZE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SPECIFY TO WHOM AN APOLOGY WAS IN ORDER.

CG: IDIOT.

GG: what

GG: are you saying you want to apologize

CG: I GUESS

CG: THIS APOLOGY WAS GOING TO GO DOWN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, SO THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE THE TIME.

CG: AND LET'S FACE IT, I WAS REALLY BEING THE WORST KIND OF PHLEGM BUBBLE BLOWN OUT A NOISY GLISTENING ASS.

CG: SO I'M SORRY.

CG: BUT TO BE FAIR, IT WAS MY PAST SELF WHO WAS GIVING YOU SUCH A HARD TIME, AND HE'S COMPLETELY DERANGED.

GG: ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again!

GG: maybe your "present self" should own up to it!

CG: YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING.

CG: HE, BEING ME, RIGHT NOW, IS OWNING UP TO WHAT A FUCKING RETARD PAST ME WAS, AND CONTINUES TO BE.

GG: laaaaame

CG: YES, I KNOW IT'S LAME.

CG: OR I KNOW THAT YOU THINK IT'S LAME WHEN I SAY SHIT LIKE THAT.

CG: BECAUSE REMEMBER

CG: I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU FROM THE FUTURE, AND I KNOW YOU DON'T COTTON TO MY PCG/FCG STUPIDITY.

CG: BUT SEE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YET.

CG: OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YET.

CG: SO I'M KIND OF PULLING A FAST ONE HERE.

GG: hahahaha, that is so ridiculous

GG: why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally?

CG: YEAH I'M GOING TO.

CG: THE THING IS, I KIND OF MISREPRESENTED MYSELF.

CG: I'M NOT AS MUCH OF A SCUMBAG AS I WAS SO DETERMINED TO MAKE OUT WITH MYSELF TO BE.

CG: FUCK I MEAN

CG: MAKE MYSELF OUT TO BE

GG: :o

CG: I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I TROLLED YOU LIKE THAT SO PERSISTENTLY

CG: FOR SOME REASON DEEP DOWN I JUST KNEW THAT I HAD TO

CG: EVEN IF IT MEANT DIGGING MYSELF INTO A HUGE HOLE WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT WOULD BE HARD TO CLIMB OUT OF

CG: AND LIKE PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING I SAID WAS COMPLETELY BASELESS BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW YOU

CG: JUST LIKE YOU DIDN'T AND STILL DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ME

CG: SO I GUESS I AM APOLOGIZING FOR IT, LIKE REALLY SERIOUSLY NOW.

CG: I, PRESENT KARKAT, IN THE CURRENT MOMENT, APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF MY STUPID PAST SELF, *WHO IS ACTUALLY ME*.

CG: THE GUY TALKING RIGHT NOW.

CG: LIKE, THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE GUYS, OK?

GG: hmmmm...

CG: HMMMM???????

GG: yes, hm

CG: HM WHAT

GG: ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me

GG: and youre right, i dont actually know you

GG: i just know the part of you who acted like a bully

GG: i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry

GG: so i will accept your apology and give you another chance

CG: OK, GREAT.

GG: and i will apologize for calling you crazy

GG: obviously i am not in much position to judge :|

CG: NO BUT

CG: YOU WERE RIGHT, I AM CRAZY

CG: BUT THANKS ANYWAY

GG: so you say you have been talking to me from the future?

CG: YEAH

CG: MAKING PLANS AND WHATNOT

CG: TO PRY OURSELVES MUTUALLY OUT OF THIS MASSIVE MOBIUS DOUBLE CLUSTERFUCK.

GG: ok, so what is the plan?

GG: i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly?

CG: OK WELL THE MOST IMMEDIATE POINT OF BUSINESS IS

CG: YOU SEE THAT GLOWING BLUE SCREEN BEHIND YOU?

GG: yes

CG: YOU NEED TO TURN THAT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT OFF.
