    <span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF YOU WOULD DROP THE PASSWORD SYSTEM AND LET FUTURE ME TALK TO YOU, HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SPOILER: THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO, BECAUSE THE PASSWORDS ARE RETARDED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why would i want to do that??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i have this on good authority from both sources</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I STILL THINK YOUR USE OF THE TERMS IS KIND OF ASININE, THERE REALLY IS NO PAST OR FUTURE KARKAT FROM YOUR VIEW</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THERE'S KARKAT WHO KNOWS LESS STUFF AND KARKAT WHO KNOWS MORE STUFF. WHY NOT JUST GATHER THE FACTS FROM THE ONE WHO'S GOT THE LOWDOWN ALREADY?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I MEAN, I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T STAND THE GUY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you see, that is your problem</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: okay, one of your many, many problems...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING STANDING IN MY WAY. YOUR STUPID PASSWORDS ARE ALSO STANDING IN MY WAY. IF NOT FOR THAT I COULD BE FAST TRACKING THIS TO SOLUTION CITY FOR US BOTH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: exactly :D</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, WHATEVER, LET'S JUST GET ON WITH THIS &quot;LINEAR CONVERSATION&quot; OK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO YOU GAVE ME THAT SILLY PASSWORD, AND WE ENDED OUR CONVERSATION A FEW MINUTES AGO FROM MY END</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND I SCANNED AHEAD LOOKING FOR A GOOD MOMENT ON YOUR TIMELINE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND I NOTICE YOU WENT BACK TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR SOME REASON</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FROG BREEDING, I THOUGHT WE WERE ON A ROLL WITH THAT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes, we still are!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHAT WAS SHE EVEN SAYING TO YOU, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THAT HORRIFYING GIBBERISH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i can understand her just fine!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I STILL DON'T REALLY GET IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHY MY DENIZEN WAS SUCH A NIGHTMARE WHILE YOURS APPARENTLY GIVES YOU GUTTURAL PEP TALKS IN SOME BYZANTINE MONSTER LANGUAGE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: we already talked about this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: echidna and i have an understanding now ;)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OOH, VAGUE BULLSHIT, IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING THING I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you might have actually learned something!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HUGE UGLY MONSTERS ARE FOR KILLING, PERIOD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: did you ever talk to kanaya about it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T REMEMBER, MAYBE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I'M A BUSY GUY, JADE. I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF, INCLUDING MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: her situation was very similar to mine</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I THOUGHT SHE KILLED HER DENIZEN TO LIGHT THE FORGE OR SOMETHING</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it doesnt sound like you got the whole story</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: or maybe you just werent listening to her :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WELL I SURE DON'T THINK IT WAS WHATEVER YOU DID</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND IN ANY CASE I THOUGHT ALL THAT WAS OVER WITH</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHY ARE YOU BACK, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FROG BREEDING?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: this was kanayas suggestion</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: KANAYA'S STILL HELPING YOU?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: im talking to her right now actually</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OH</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I SEE HER ACROSS THE ROOM, SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ANYONE ON A COMPUTER NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH TIME</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: a few hours in your future!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AH, I SEE HOW IT IS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU WON'T TALK TO FUTURE KARKAT UNTIL I JUMP THROUGH YOUR FUCKING PASSWORD HOOPS AND BECOME HIM EVENTUALLY</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT YOU'LL TALK TO FUTURE KANAYA JUST LIKE THAT. DOUBLE STANDARD ANYBODY??? JADE SAYS YES PLEASE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT SHIT SPOILED FROM THE FUTURE THOUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I THINK I AM ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A RELIGIOUS PERSON, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN TO REMOVE THE AWESOME SUFFERING THAT TROLLIAN'S TEMPORAL CHAT BULLSHIT MIRACULOUSLY CONTINUES TO INFLICT ON ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: MAYBE THE MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS WILL COME AND TAKE MY PAIN AWAY?? OH YES, THAT SOUNDS HEAVENLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: JADE, PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO PAINT MY FACE TO OUTWARDLY REFLECT THE BEAUTY OF MY INNER AWAKENING, AND DRUB MY THINK PAN MERCILESSLY TO REDUCE MY INTELLIGENCE TO THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THESE BELIEFS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: siiign, what are you even talking about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ARE WE ALMOST DONE CRAFTING THIS &quot;MASTER PLAN&quot;?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I HAVE STUFF TO ATTEND TO HERE. MY TEAM IS FALLING APART.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AND I CAN'T FIND GAMZEE ANYWHERE. I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT HAVE WANDERED OFF SOMEWHERE AND GOT HURT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: aw</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T TELLING ME ABOUT MY FUTURE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i know, i made an exception</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but only one!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG. JUST UPDATE ME ON THE FROGS, AND GIVE ME A NEW PASSWORD, OK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: kanaya thinks we should all talk about this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy</span>
<br />
