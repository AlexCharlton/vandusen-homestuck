CG: IF YOU WOULD DROP THE PASSWORD SYSTEM AND LET FUTURE ME TALK TO YOU, HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.

CG: SPOILER: THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO, BECAUSE THE PASSWORDS ARE RETARDED.

GG: why would i want to do that??

GG: the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!

GG: i have this on good authority from both sources

CG: I STILL THINK YOUR USE OF THE TERMS IS KIND OF ASININE, THERE REALLY IS NO PAST OR FUTURE KARKAT FROM YOUR VIEW

CG: THERE'S KARKAT WHO KNOWS LESS STUFF AND KARKAT WHO KNOWS MORE STUFF. WHY NOT JUST GATHER THE FACTS FROM THE ONE WHO'S GOT THE LOWDOWN ALREADY?

CG: I MEAN, I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T STAND THE GUY.

GG: you see, that is your problem

GG: okay, one of your many, many problems...

GG: you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!

GG: even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before

GG: it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing

GG: so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!

GG: its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out

CG: THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING STANDING IN MY WAY. YOUR STUPID PASSWORDS ARE ALSO STANDING IN MY WAY. IF NOT FOR THAT I COULD BE FAST TRACKING THIS TO SOLUTION CITY FOR US BOTH.

GG: exactly :D

CG: OK, WHATEVER, LET'S JUST GET ON WITH THIS "LINEAR CONVERSATION" OK?

GG: ok

CG: SO YOU GAVE ME THAT SILLY PASSWORD, AND WE ENDED OUR CONVERSATION A FEW MINUTES AGO FROM MY END

CG: AND I SCANNED AHEAD LOOKING FOR A GOOD MOMENT ON YOUR TIMELINE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN

CG: AND I NOTICE YOU WENT BACK TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR SOME REASON

GG: yes

CG: SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY

CG: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FROG BREEDING, I THOUGHT WE WERE ON A ROLL WITH THAT

GG: yes, we still are!

GG: this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.

CG: WHAT WAS SHE EVEN SAYING TO YOU, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THAT HORRIFYING GIBBERISH.

GG: i can understand her just fine!

CG: I STILL DON'T REALLY GET IT.

CG: WHY MY DENIZEN WAS SUCH A NIGHTMARE WHILE YOURS APPARENTLY GIVES YOU GUTTURAL PEP TALKS IN SOME BYZANTINE MONSTER LANGUAGE.

GG: we already talked about this

GG: echidna and i have an understanding now ;)

CG: OOH, VAGUE BULLSHIT, IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING THING I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF.

GG: well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly

GG: you might have actually learned something!!!!!!

CG: HUGE UGLY MONSTERS ARE FOR KILLING, PERIOD.

GG: did you ever talk to kanaya about it?

CG: I DON'T REMEMBER, MAYBE?

CG: I'M A BUSY GUY, JADE. I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF, INCLUDING MYSELF.

GG: her situation was very similar to mine

CG: I THOUGHT SHE KILLED HER DENIZEN TO LIGHT THE FORGE OR SOMETHING

GG: it doesnt sound like you got the whole story

GG: or maybe you just werent listening to her :p

CG: WELL I SURE DON'T THINK IT WAS WHATEVER YOU DID

CG: AND IN ANY CASE I THOUGHT ALL THAT WAS OVER WITH

CG: WHY ARE YOU BACK, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FROG BREEDING?

GG: this was kanayas suggestion

CG: KANAYA'S STILL HELPING YOU?

GG: yes!

GG: im talking to her right now actually

CG: OH

CG: I SEE HER ACROSS THE ROOM, SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ANYONE ON A COMPUTER NOW.

GG: durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius

CG: WHICH TIME

GG: a few hours in your future!

CG: AH, I SEE HOW IT IS.

CG: YOU WON'T TALK TO FUTURE KARKAT UNTIL I JUMP THROUGH YOUR FUCKING PASSWORD HOOPS AND BECOME HIM EVENTUALLY

CG: BUT YOU'LL TALK TO FUTURE KANAYA JUST LIKE THAT. DOUBLE STANDARD ANYBODY??? JADE SAYS YES PLEASE.

GG: you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you

GG: she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all

GG: it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!

CG: I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT SHIT SPOILED FROM THE FUTURE THOUGH.

GG: yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!

GG: but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask

CG: I THINK I AM ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A RELIGIOUS PERSON, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN TO REMOVE THE AWESOME SUFFERING THAT TROLLIAN'S TEMPORAL CHAT BULLSHIT MIRACULOUSLY CONTINUES TO INFLICT ON ME.

CG: MAYBE THE MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS WILL COME AND TAKE MY PAIN AWAY?? OH YES, THAT SOUNDS HEAVENLY.

CG: JADE, PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO PAINT MY FACE TO OUTWARDLY REFLECT THE BEAUTY OF MY INNER AWAKENING, AND DRUB MY THINK PAN MERCILESSLY TO REDUCE MY INTELLIGENCE TO THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THESE BELIEFS.

GG: siiign, what are you even talking about?

CG: ARE WE ALMOST DONE CRAFTING THIS "MASTER PLAN"?

CG: I HAVE STUFF TO ATTEND TO HERE. MY TEAM IS FALLING APART.

CG: AND I CAN'T FIND GAMZEE ANYWHERE. I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT HAVE WANDERED OFF SOMEWHERE AND GOT HURT.

GG: aw

GG: well...

GG: youll find him

CG: I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T TELLING ME ABOUT MY FUTURE.

GG: i know, i made an exception

GG: but only one!

CG: LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG. JUST UPDATE ME ON THE FROGS, AND GIVE ME A NEW PASSWORD, OK?

GG: kanaya thinks we should all talk about this

GG: she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy

CG: BUSY WITH WHAT?

GG: :x!!!!!

GG: she is opening a memo
