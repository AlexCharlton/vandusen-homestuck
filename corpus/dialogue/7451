uu: CROCKER.

uu: HEY IT'S ME.

uu: REMEMBER ME?

GG: What the?

uu: TUMUT

uu: OOPS NO.

uu: *HOLDS SHIFT.* *NOSTALGICALLY.*

uu: tumut

uu: YESSSS.

GG: Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.

GG: You are the absolute last person I want to hear from right now.

GG: And the bottom of that list is pretty competitive territory at the moment!

uu: DON'T BE LIKE THAT. YOU STUPID EARTH COW.

uu: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE BECOMING FRIENDS. IF YOU RECOIL FROM MY OLIVE BRANCH.

uu: LIKE I'M FLAILING A WITHERED MUMMY'S SEVERED LIMB IN YOUR DIRECTION.

GG: I don't want us to become friends!

GG: We all thought you were gone for good. And we liked it that way!

GG: Please don't tell me you've found a second wind of petty trolling in you.

uu: HEY. I DON'T TROLL.

uu: I *JEER*. GET IT RIGHT.

uu: TROLLING IS FOR LOSERS. LOSERS SPECIFICALLY WHO ARE TROLLS.

GG: Whatever. And what's with the ugly green text?

GG: Reading your malformed sentence fragments was unpleasant enough as it was.

uu: I BORROWED IT FROM MY SISTER.

uu: AND SHUT UP. IT LOOKS GREAT.

uu: AND IS NO UGLIER THAN YOU. WHO I CAN SEE NOW WITH EASE. FOR THE RECORD.

GG: "Whom" you can see, moron.

GG: And no, you can't!

GG: Calliope said you couldn't see us at all in our game session. So I think you're lying!

uu: AM I REALLY.

uu: WHEN RIGHT NOW I AM LOOKING AT A HOMELY FEMALE IN DUMB BLUE PANTS. SULKING IN A GRAY PLACE. TYPING ON A COMPUTER WITH A STRANGE HUMAN FACE?
