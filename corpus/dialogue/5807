GT: in my childhood, it was hours of fun, and hundreds of painful injuries.

AG: Hey........

AG: This thing isn't slimy at all! What the hell.

GT: nope.

AG: I've noticed humans don't seem to keep any slime around the hive. And yet you are strangely cavalier a8out your open display of certain........ receptacles.

AG: What's the deal with that? Is it that you're just that ashamed of your secretions as a species?

GT: um.

GT: not... really?

GT: humans just don't really have much use for slime, i guess.

GT: honestly, i can't think of a single practical use for slime, other than to be gross!

AG: So 8izarre.

GT: anyway, this thing is kind of a death trap, and i haven't ridden it for years.

GT: i think my dad had it installed as one of his ridiculous ways of making a man out of me.

AG: Sure.

AG: My custodian had her ways of making me tougher too.

GT: yeah.

GT: parents, right? haha.

GT: anyway, that's my back yard. pretty damn boring, sorry.

GT: i would show you inside, but i don't think my dad would take too kindly to bringing an alien inside.

GT: or, just yet. i would need to brace him for it.

AG: That's fine.

AG: What else can you show me?

GT: i could show you around my neighborhood, if you want.

AG: Sounds gr8.
