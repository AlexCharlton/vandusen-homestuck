EB: rose?

EB: are you there?

EB: i went through the gate, nanna said you might be here too.

EB: are you in kind of this spooky glowy place with oily rivers and stuff?

EB: let me know ok. 

TT: I guess one could use those words to describe it.

TT: If armed with a predilection for the inapt. 

EB: bluh bluh bluuuuuhhhhh.

EB: ok, what words would you use, miss wordypants mcsmartybluh.

TT: Eerily iridescent?

EB: umm...

TT: I certainly don't see any oily rivers.

TT: There's an ocean though.

EB: i haven't found an ocean yet.

EB: but i dunno, the place is really big.

EB: it's like a whole planet down here.

EB: oh man, which reminds me.

EB: i just got hounded by a troll.

TT: Yes, one of them is bugging me now.

TT: I thought it was odd timing.

EB: yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but like not the same session as ours or something.

EB: oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but whatever.

TT: Color my curiosity piqued, I guess.

EB: yeah, i guess answer him if you want. or not.

EB: but anyway, it's great you made it here alive and stuff!

EB: so dave came through?

TT: Eventually.

TT: Pardon the envy I'm about to vent in your direction.

EB: for what?

TT: For finding yourself at the mercy of a rational orchestrator.

EB: oh, haha.

EB: yeah, i'd feel kinda weird if dave was watching me too.

TT: You don't feel weird when I watch you?

EB: rose i feel weird when you're just TALKING to me, when you're watching me it's just like the weird frosting on the big weirdo cake.

TT: I can't see you now, for what it's worth.

EB: yes i'm freeeeeeeeee :D

EB: ok, i'm going to go over this river and through these woods.

EB: you talk to your troll i guess.

EB: we'll compare notes later.

TT: Ok.

TT: Bye, John.
