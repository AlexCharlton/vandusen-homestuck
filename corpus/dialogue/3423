<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: let me know ok. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess one could use those words to describe it.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought it was odd timing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but like not the same session as ours or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Color my curiosity piqued, I guess.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: for what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For finding yourself at the mercy of a rational orchestrator.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, haha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i'd feel kinda weird if dave was watching me too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You don't feel weird when I watch you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rose i feel weird when you're just TALKING to me, when you're watching me it's just like the weird frosting on the big weirdo cake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I can't see you now, for what it's worth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes i'm freeeeeeeeee :D</span>
