EB: i am messaging from my dad's pda.

TT: The one you threw into the yard?

EB: no, i am telling you.

EB: it jumped out of my sylladex like a frightened weasel.

TT: What were you doing with it in the first place?

TT: I am not sensing a lot of regard for the personal property of others.

TT: Is this how your pent-up frustration with your father manifests itself?

EB: what? no.

EB: those were all accidents.

EB: please take your psycho-babblery elsewhere, miss!

TT: Your bathroom is a mess.

TT: Did you do that too?

EB: oh man, see this isn't cool.

EB: all this snooping nonsense!

TT: There's a cake in the toilet.

EB: yes. there is.

TT: I'm tempted to clean it up for you.

EB: ok, if that will satisfy your weird ocd complex then go ahead.

TT: My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder complex?

TT: Can a disorder also be a complex?

EB: in your case, probably!

TT: Sounds complicated.

EB: anyway...

EB: i am going to have a look at this enormous platformy thing you put on the balcony.
