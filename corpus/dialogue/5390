AA: oh look this was my hive!

AA: before it was destroyed

TG: oh so this is the trollplanet

TG: pretty cool not really what i pictured

AA: what did you picture

TG: i dont know its more subdued

TG: i pictured a lot more mayhem like

TG: a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets

AA: thats very silly and a little perverse

TG: hahaha

AA: but actually that sounds like what it might have been like on some parts of the planet sooo

TG: can we not go to those parts

AA: ill put in a good word with your bubble about it

TG: awesome

TG: so what am i supposed to do now that im dead

TG: what is like

TG: the primary activity here

TG: that ghosts get their shit worked up over

TG: like

TG: where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking

AA: i dont know about hauntoffs

AA: but there is plenty of time to satisfy various curiosities you might have about existence and whatnot

TG: boring

AA: is it

TG: just kidding that sounds cool

AA: oh! yes

TG: what else

AA: there are all sorts of friends to meet

AA: ones you already know and ones you dont

AA: there is plenty of time for just about anything

AA: lots and lots of time

AA: enough time to understand that time isnt much of anything at all

TG: it isnt

AA: time is like a game

AA: just one fun game in realitys cupboard which is full of them

AA: its the one we are the best at!

AA: while other people are better at the other games

AA: but when all the games are back in the cupboard everyone is about the same

AA: and games are fun but sometimes you dont realize how much fun you were having until theyre all over

AA: and sometimes you look back and realize for some stupid reason you werent having any fun at all!

AA: then you laugh

TG: ha

TG: haha

TG: i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that

AA: that laugh will suffice

AA: hey!

AA: want to see inside my hive

TG: yeah sure

TG: well

TG: how about later

TG: not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home

TG: and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much

TG: if thats ok and i guess also possible

AA: it is quite possible and more than ok
