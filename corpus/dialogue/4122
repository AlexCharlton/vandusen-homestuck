CT: D --> Good

CT: D --> Use your cunning and venom to make them envy our nobility

AG: Oh man, was that sarcasm? That sounded like sarcasm!

CT: D --> No

CT: D --> Humorous insincerity is for pedantic wigglers

AG: Pshhhhhhhh, I know! I know you never make jokes. I was the one 8eing sarcastic, you stooge!

AG: I was 8eing sarcastic a8out you 8eing sarcastic. Duh.

AG: 8ecause I promised I would and it's none of your damn 8usiness! Man.

AG: Quit your prying! Always fidgeting and poking and prying.

CT: D --> Fine

CT: D --> Then let's proceed with the plan in a curt and professional manner

AG: Agreeeeeeeed.

AG: So just to review!

AG: We will let Aradia perpetr8 her cute little ploy on Sollux and usurp his power.

CT: D --> Yes

AG: Isn't it funny when these chumps try to get all tactical and underhanded? It's really adora8le!

CT: D --> I guess it is pretty quaint

AG: Anyway. She makes her little powergra8, and that's when we 8oth step in and usurp her as co-leaders.

AG: Right????????

CT: D --> That's the plan

AG: Ok, good. Then the 8est team will 8e led 8y the two highest 8loods, the way it should 8e!

CT: D --> Also, I don't have sleeves

CT: D --> I am as transparent as can be, and my word is my bond

AG: I know! Don't worry, dude. I trust you completely.

CT: D --> You know

CT: D --> I can feel you trying to read my mind

AG: 8ullshit!
