GG: But they weren't human. They were funny looking, perfectly white creatures.

GT: Yeah those are prospitians.

GT: They have these hard carapace shells and also have something to do with chess i think?

GG: Well, I don't know if they had much to do with chess here.

GT: Like...

GT: Sad?

GG: Yes.

GG: I determined they were in mourning, actually.

GT: Hey.

GG: Shoosh! I'm getting there.
