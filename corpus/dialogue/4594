GA: Your Speech Was Really

GA: Emotional

CG: OK I DEFINITELY DON'T NEED YOU BUSTING MY BULGE ABOUT THE SPEECH NOW.

CG: I'VE TAKEN ENOUGH SHIT. I GOT A LITTLE WORKED UP OK?

CG: AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, WHY DON'T YOU COME SAY IT TO MY FACE.

CG: I'M FED UP WITH THESE BACK DOOR NOOKBITING SHENANIGANS.

GA: I Dont Mean To Critique Your Speech

GA: I Just Wanted To Ask You Something In Confidence

GA: About The Humans

CG: OK, WHAT IS IT?

GA: Are You Sure Theyre Responsible For Our Misfortune

CG: YES. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

GA: Was It On Account Of Malice Or Incompetence

CG: I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BOTH?

CG: WHY DOES IT MATTER.

GA: It Sort Of Does

GA: Im Not Even That Sure Why

GA: This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach

GA: For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand

CG: GOD DAMMIT.

CG: NO MORE MYSTERIES, PLEASE.

CG: YOU'D THINK WE'D HAD OUR FILL OF THEM BY NOW.

CG: IF I HAVE TO SOLVE ONE MORE RIDDLE, I'M GOING TO...

CG: I DON'T KNOW.

GA: Will Your Response Involve An Athletic Maneuver Of Some Sort

CG: NO

CG: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

CG: I WILL JUST GO OVER THERE AND WEEP GENTLY IN THE HORN PILE.

CG: SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

GA: Um

CG: WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS

CG: THEY ARE ALL LUDICROUSLY INCOMPETENT.

CG: SOFT, PINK FRAGILE THINGS WHO DO NOTHING BUT WASTE TIME.

CG: THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE HORNS!

GA: What

GA: Really

CG: YEAH, I WAS LIKE, WHOA DID THEY GET FILED DOWN OR SOMETHING

CG: BUT NO IT TURNS OUT THAT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE.

GA: Weird

CG: THEY'RE A MISERABLE POINTLESS CROP OF LIFEFORMS FROM A MEANINGLESS BORING PUSTULE OF A PLANET.

CG: IT'S INFURIATING THEY WERE SOMEHOW ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER US.

GA: It Is Pretty Disheartening

GA: But

GA: You Are Absolutely Sure They Are All Failures

GA: And That They Have No Chance Of Succeeding

CG: YEP.

CG: IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

GA: Im Not Sure Which Depresses Me More

GA: The Sabotage Of Our Session Or The Futility Of Theirs

CG: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.

CG: YOU'RE BEING REALLY WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

GA: Well I Havent Asked What I Wanted To Ask

CG: THEN ASK!!!

GA: Its About TentacleTherapist

CG: YEAH. THAT'S THE ROSE HUMAN.

CG: SHE'S APPARENTLY PRETTY SARCASTIC.

CG: IT'S IN MY NOTES.

GA: You Have Notes On Them

CG: YES.

GA: I Guess

GA: Thats Why Youre Our Leader Karkat

CG: NO, I'M YOUR LEADER BECAUSE OF MY INCREDIBLE TACTICAL SKILLS AND MY ABILITY TO MOBILIZE AND MOTIVATE A BUNCH OF USELESS PEOPLE TOWARD A COMMON GOAL, AND BECAUSE I'M EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND INTREPID. ALSO BECAUSE LEADERSHIP IS IN MY BLOOD. WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

GA: Statements Like That Are Also Why Youre Our Leader

CG: OK, I'LL ACCEPT THAT.

GA: Have You Talked To Her

CG: WHO

GA: The Rose Human

GA: Also

GA: Do We Really Have To Say Things Like The Rose Human

CG: OF COURSE WE DO.

CG: IT SOUNDS SUITABLY DISDAINFUL.

CG: I MEAN, IF A BUNCH OF ALIENS STARTED HASSLING YOU, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO ACT REALLY HIGH AND MIGHTY, AND SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY, RIGHT?.

CG: WHICH WE ARE, OF COURSE.

GA: Uh Okay

CG: AND NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER.

CG: I WILL PROBABLY STEER CLEAR OF HER FOR THE MOST PART.

CG: I HAVE MY SIGHTS SET ON THE JOHN HUMAN, AND PROBABLY ALSO THE JADE HUMAN, SHE'S A HUGE CULPRIT TOO.

GA: It Just

GA: Feels Really Silly When We Say Things Like The John Human In Confidence Amongst Ourselves

CG: WE HAVE TO COMMIT TO THIS. STAY IN CHARACTER, YOU KNOW?

CG: REMEMBER THE SPEECH.

GA: The Speech Has Become Emblazoned On My Think Pan

GA: Virtually Ensconced In The Fold Of My Personal Mythology

CG: DID YOU WANT TO TROLL HER? ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING?

CG: BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE GREAT, I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

GA: I Dont Know

GA: Im Not Sure If Ive Got It In Me Right Now

CG: COME ON. YOU'LL BE GREAT AT IT.

CG: PLEASE JUST DO THIS ONE THING FOR ME. WE'VE GOT TO STAY COORDINATED ON THIS.

CG: TOO MANY OF THESE FUCKS ARE GOING ROGUE.

CG: LIKE WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING.

GA: Fine

CG: GREAT! THANKS KANAYA.

CG: I'LL EXPECT A FULL REPORT SOON.

GA: A Report About What

CG: LIKE

CG: HOW HASSLED YOU GOT HER TO BE

CG: BUT LESS STUPID SOUNDING THAN THAT.

GA: Is There A Metric For That Concept

CG: NO

CG: WELL THERE COULD BE

CG: WE CAN GAUGE YOUR RESULTS WITH THE "FLIGHTY BROADS AND THEIR SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER".

GA: That Seems Just As Disparaging To Me As It Is To Her

CG: YEAH WELL

CG: USE IT AS MOTIVATION

CG: I GOTTA GET CRACKING HERE, LATER.
