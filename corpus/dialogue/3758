TT: I just explained this to Other Dave.

TT: Do I have to explain everything to you twice now?

TG: no i know

TG: im using daves spare computer i saw the whole conversation through his pesterchum account

TT: Oh, I see.

TT: So instead of having to double explain, I merely have to put up with being double spied upon.

TT: What a relief!

TG: i just mean

TG: you didnt burn that book in the future

TG: that book was completely pointless

TT: I know.

TT: But now it's not.

TT: You appeared to make it relevant by traveling to the past.

TG: so does that mean the sleeping thing worked

TG: you remember the future

TT: I remember some things.

TG: ok cool

TG: so why is the cat code so terrible now

TT: I don't know.

TT: But the gods were pretty emphatic about it.

TG: well ok i guess its done but why are you so sure theyre right

TT: Have you ever known them to be wrong?

TG: i guess not

TG: but they sort of freak me out

TG: i mean listening to gross space mutants all day isnt my idea of an awesome time

TG: especially the ones that sing oh god

TT: Is that why you always kept the music turned up?

TG: no i flip out to ill jams because they kick ass

TG: obviously

TT: I guess we'll chalk another riddle up in the solved column.

TG: yeah case the fuck closed
