CG: THE PASSWORD IS

CG: SEE YOU SOON

CG: OK UH

CG: I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR LACK OF RESPONSE AS TACIT VERIFICATION.

CG: ALSO

CG: THIS PRETTY MUCH HAS TO BE THE LAST CONVERSATION WE HAVE, RIGHT?

CG: YOUR TIMELINE CUTS OUT COMPLETELY IN A MINUTE OR TWO BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCH.

CG: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT UP THERE?

CG: ARE YOU HYPNOTIZED BY THE FLASHY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK.

CG: THAT'S BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE JOHN STARTED SCRATCHING THAT BIG GODDAMN RECORD, AREN'T YOU ACCLIMATED TO IT BY NOW?

CG: HELLO????????????

CG: HARLEY, JEGUS MOTHER OF SCREAMING FUCK.

CG: WHATEVER, I HAVE SHIT TO DO NOW.

CG: I GUESS I SHOULD BE KEEPING AN EYE IN THE SKY TOO NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.

CG: THE BRIGHT GREEN BEACON SHOULD BE APPEARING ANY MINUTE, ASSUMING YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO BLOW UP THE SUN.

CG: AND THEN

CG: WELL, THEN I GUESS MAYBE WE ALL GET TO HANG OUT?

CG: WHILE MAYBE ALSO NOT BEING IN UNYIELDING MORTAL PERIL???

CG: IT'S GETTING KIND OF OLD, FRANKLY.

CG: OK, WELL THIS IS A PRETTY CRAPPY FAREWELL, BUT I GUESS IT'LL HAVE TO DO SINCE THERE IS SOME SERIOUSLY SHOW-STOPPING SHIT TRANSPIRING UP THERE IN FUCKING OUTER SPACE.

CG: LATER JADE, I'M GOING TO GO MAKE SURE JOHN KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

CG: AND IN CASE NONE OF THIS WORKS AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO MEET

CG: I GUESS I SHOULD SAY...

CG: SINCE APPARENTLY MY GUTLESS FUTURE SELF CAN'T EXPRESS HIMSELF AND NEVER GOT AROUND TO SAYING SO

CG: THUS LEAVING IT UP TO ME AS USUAL

CG: TO SAY

CG: THAT
