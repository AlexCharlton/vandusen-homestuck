GA: A While Ago

TT: Before you first contacted me?

GA: I Have To Confess That

GA: Ive Been Experiencing Something Like

GA: Impression Whiplash

GA: Since That Time

TT: What do you mean?

GA: At First I Thought You Were Foolish And Incompetent

TT: My apologies for whatever misstep I may have taken to dispel that impression.

TT: It was an honest mistake, I swear.

GA: You See Thats What Im Talking About

GA: That Was A Very Snarky Remark That Happened Just Now

GA: Stratified By Your Signature Varieties Of Insincerity Which Cut Through The Literal Meaning Of The Statement Like Colorful Ribbons

GA: And The Net Intent Is Something Maddening To Try To Know

GA: Its Meaning I Think Exists At The Inscrutable Nexus Of Semantic Space Where Humor Chafes Against Soft Malice

GA: A Place Perhaps The Human Mind Occupies More Comfortably I Dont Know

GA: Xenopsychology Isnt My Strong Suit

GA: Or Even A Real Word

TT: ...

GA: Uh Yeah I Know Im Babbling Again

GA: The Point Is Its Not The Type Of Behavior A Very Stupid Person Can Perpetrate

GA: And So My Impression Has Thrashed Around From Conversation To Conversation

GA: And Now

GA: Rather Than Suspecting You Of Incompetence

GA: I Have Begun To Fear Just The Opposite

GA: I Think You Might Be Dangerous

TT: To whom?

GA: Maybe Not Knowing That Is What Really Bothers Me

GA: Why Dont You Put The Turtle Ruins Down

GA: And Return To Your House

GA: I Have Sketched Some New Outfits For You That I Think Are Nice

GA: We Could Try To Make Them

GA: It Will Be Fun

TT: You seem to have taken quite an interest in my wardrobe decisions.

TT: Are all trolls so fashion-minded?

GA: Urrgh No

GA: Sadly

TT: Maybe later.

GA: What If There Isnt A Later

TT: Well, we already know there won't be.

TT: That's nothing new.

GA: I Mean

GA: There Not Being A Later Might Happen Sooner Than You Think

TT: Wow, what?

GA: I Mean

GA: For You Specifically

GA: Okay

GA: This Was Something Else I Wanted To Say

GA: Or Ask About

GA: But Im Afraid My Asking Might Play A Role In The Outcome

GA: And I Dont Know If I Want That
