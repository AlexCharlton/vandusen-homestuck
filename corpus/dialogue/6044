<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so i gUess today is finally the day yoU make everything better.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is the day whereafter the legendary octet of mUtUal progenitoriety will come together and heal a great breach in paradox space.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a day delivered throUgh eighty billion years and foUr distinct Universal instances worth of Unfathomable tUrbUlence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and while the emerald eye of this storm is fixed in the abyss forever</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: today yoU are poised to escape its scowl once and for all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: by skaias gUiding light, yoU may leave behind its tUrning arms of bright coloUrs and mayhem, and secUre peace for yoUr cosmic progeny for all dUration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and if yoU are to meet this departUre with trepidation i woUld Understand! bUt also i woUld ask</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: is there nothing i can do to ease yoUr mind?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Gosh! So formal today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. u_u;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm afraid i am gUilty of rehearsing this pep talk well in advance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i thoUght yoU deserved a proper sendoff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: D'aww.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: is there nothing i can do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it was a serioUs qUestion. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You needn't worry about easing my nerves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be nearly as thrilled about today as I am!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: splendid! ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt remember i will be here to help, whilst refraining from caUsal spoilers to the best of my ability.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That is reassuring!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: have yoU corresponded with yoUr first designated co-player yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, I haven't seen her online yet today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm really hoping Lalonde won't flake out on me this time. Have you heard from her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not the today that is local to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh i do have a wee bit more troUble monitoring her than the rest of yoU. cUrioUs dark patches in transmission, hUmph.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: still, i woUldn't fret over it. she is as good a chUm as any yoU have and shoUld come throUgh Ultimately, even if things seem dire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If you say so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I wanted to tell you, I had an amazing dream last night!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: blimey! :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I believe it may have been of the sort you described. A dream of awakening, presuming I haven't just flatout lost my marbles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: indeed, im sUre it was. i knew yoU woUld wake Up soon!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: might yoU describe what yoU saw?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was in a bright gold city. Above was a brilliant blue sky, but the horizon was dark as night.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Was this the place you told me about? What was it called...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ah, shucks, does this count as a &quot;causal spoiler?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not at all! that is a simple detail aboUt the realm yoU are aboUt to explore, withoUt directly involving yoUr fUtUre decisions of conseqUence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the place yoU visited was called prospit. it is where i have woken Up every time i have gone to sleep for most of my life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I didn't see you there. At least, I don't think I did!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, yoU woUldnt have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my prospit is an alternate version from yoUrs, in a completely different session qUite far afield of yoUr reality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if we are ever to meet in person, it is Unlikely to be while playing oUr respective games!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I mentioned this briefly to Jake, and he didn't have much to say before we parted ways.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I will gather that if this is all true, then it means Jake had not awoken yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think this is for yoU to determine in time. what is yoUr hUnch?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But there was one thing about the dream that was very troubling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm becoming nervous to consider what it might mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: Understandable. bUt it will be important to practice patience today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU have a long road ahead of yoU, and many qUestions will be answered in time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt we can talk it over later. now, we both have games to prepare for!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know yoU coUld never fUlly appreciate what this actUally meant, bUt i took mUch care to sync Up these conversations with yoU on the same day that i begin playing as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that way, we can joUrney throUgh oUr sessions together and compare notes! :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrm. I'm still not sure I appreciate what that means, but I appreciate that a nice gesture has been made if you say so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I should just start believing all of this now, huh? Rather than learning it to be true later and feeling the fool for all my curmudgeonly skepticism?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ~_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: For starters, I guess I could drop my reservations about your story?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: will yoU :U!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I can write off much to tomfoolery as I'm no stranger to a good prank myself. But quite honestly you seem too kind for this charade. Not the type I'd expect to trot out such persistent falsehoods beyond their humorous welcome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So what do I know! Consarn it, maybe you are an alien girl from Uranus, and together we are about to play a game which determines the fate of existence. Sign me up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, hee hee! bUt i never claimed to be from that planet, which is only in the far reaches of yoUr solar system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in fact i am from mUch farther away. a different Universe altogether.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt if yoU trUly mean it, thank yoU for believing me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now, jane my lovely, let Us prepare for this adventUre.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: remember what i said aboUt the need for patience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: patience with yoUr friends. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: patience for yoUr growth as a hero of life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and patience for the coming of the other foUr of legend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a hero of breath and of light and of time and of space!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and if yoU still find yoUrself in doUbt</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUst check the inscription on that big old book downstairs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: after all, if yoU cant trUst words written by yoUr own hand</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: then what Use is trUst at all? ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: &lt;kisses!&gt;</span>
