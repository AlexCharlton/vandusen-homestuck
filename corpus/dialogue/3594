TG: take the card the books are on

TG: flip it over

EB: umm...

TG: so you can see the code

EB: wait a minute!

EB: i see what you're trying to do.

EB: i won't tell you the code for rose's books!

TG: dude you dont have to tell me the code

TG: just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all

EB: ok...

EB: i guess.

EB: yeah there's a code.

TG: alright cool

TG: you can ditch the books now if you want

TG: maybe put them back on the floor

TG: so rose doesnt think you were snooping

TG: seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there

TG: what is even with you

EB: HAHA DAVE,

EB: I THINK ALL THIS LAUGHING MADE ME POOP IN MY PANTS TOO HARD.

TG: isnt that your birthday package there

EB: oh, yeah, i think it might be.

TG: maybe you should look at it

TG: i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours

EB: yeah, maybe.

EB: i wonder if she finished...

EB: she was so tight lipped about the damn thing! i am really curious.
