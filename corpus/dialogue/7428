    <span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: JAKE, LET ME ASK YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE TALKED?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wasnt it a few days ago?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: NO. TRY A FEW <span style="text-decoration: underline">WEEKS</span> AGO!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: AND EVEN THEN, YOU MESSAGED ME JUST TO TALK ABOUT SOME STUPID SHIT THAT HAPPENED WITH DIRK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: A TEDIOUS GESTURE WHICH YOU THEN SAW FIT TO REPRISE ON MY BIRTHDAY OF ALL DAYS, WHILST CONSIDERATELY FORGETTING ABOUT IT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: AND EVEN WHEN I REMINDED YOU ABOUT IT, YOU STILL BARGED AHEAD WITH YOUR SELF-INDULGENT RELATIONSHIP CLAPTRAP ANYWAY!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I didnt realize it was so long ago. Sorry about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Again all i can say is where does the time go? I guess i have trouble keeping up with everything im supposed to. Which it would seem includes personal relationships as much as calendars.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not much of a leader of people. Not like you are jane. I think when it comes to adventuring maybe im more of a solo act?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Which now that i think about it might be contributing to my problems with dirk. Maybe thats part of the reason why i needed some space?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh brother there i go again blustering about my problems. I guess i see what you mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But really if you wanted to talk sooner then why didnt you get in touch with me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It feels as though im always the one to say hello to you lately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YEAH! THAT'S BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME WE CHAT, YOU DO NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT YOURSELF!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YOU NEVER ASK ME HOW I'M FEELING OR WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO. YOU JUST LAUNCH INTO YOUR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS, AND I JUST LISTEN LIKE AN ACCOMMODATING FOOL AS ALWAYS!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: SO I JUST STOPPED BOTHERING! WHY SHOULD I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THAT REPEATEDLY?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE MOST THOUGHTLESS, SELF-CENTERED PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I CAN'T BELIEVE I USED TO FEEL...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Used to feel what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: JAKE, HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU HOW IT MUST FEEL FOR SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HER FRIEND GO ON AND ON ABOUT HIS BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS WHEN...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: WHEN ALL ALONG SHE...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: BUT SHE JUST COULDN'T SAY BECAUSE SHE BLEW IT AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M BOTHERING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. NEVER MIND.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Now hold the phone.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jane i think i may finally understand whats been going on here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: In retrospect i cant believe ive been this blind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre right i really can be deplorably thick sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Looking back i can see how many of our conversations must have been torment for you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You really should have told me how you felt sooner!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YEAH. I...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I know. :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If you told me you had the hots for dirk i would have backed off without another word.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What are friends for!</span>
