<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but at least its nice and dark and quiet in here and free of distactions</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what are you trying to do exactly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i have to make a spikeball appear out of thin air</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i remember making some of those cubes with my alchemiter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think that's what a blank card makes? so yeah, they're super primitive.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but making pumpkins is pretty impressive. they're like... these big ol' vegetables.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no dude</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: pumpkins are helllls o primitive</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: drummin up a dumb gourd aint nothing to write home about</span>
<br />
