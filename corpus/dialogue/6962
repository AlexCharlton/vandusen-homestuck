GT: Things sure are a rumblin here in this enchanted purple palace.

GT: I cant believe i never found those hidden transport pads under the thing.

TT: Dude, I could have told you they were there.

GT: How did you know about them?

TT: I didn't.

TT: But it's like platformer gaming 101. You look everywhere for secret passages and power-ups and shit.

TT: Elevators are especially fucking suspicious.

TT: You go down an elevator, you wait for the elevator to go back up, you take a peek at what's underneath.

TT: Maybe it's just death spikes. Or maybe you hit warp zone paydirt.

GT: You are so wise. I will never be as elite of a game bro as you.

TT: I'm not a Game Bro. I just know literally everything about basically all subjects.

TT: Now go back where you came from. Dirk might need help.

GT: Will you untwist your virtual knickers. I have everything under control.

GT: I think this may be where my grandma used to go during some of her expeditions.

GT: You dont just pass up the chance for an adventure like this!

TT: Yes, Jake. You do.

TT: How much deeper down the damn bunny hole do you need to go? There is no White Rabbit waiting for you here.

GT: We will just see about THAT.

GT: Besides i have my skulltop with me so i can swoop in to assist dirk at any time!

TT: This is an atrocious idea.
