<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I am currently scrawling notes furiously into one of the many psychoanalysis journals I maintain for you. Published papers forthcoming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because, you know, it's not like either of us have anything better to do at the moment than to evaluate each other's radically debilitating pathologies.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But I am watching him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I suspect he is preoccupied with the fact that he just had a bucket of water dumped on his head by the ghost of his dead grandmother, who also happens to be dressed like a clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hahahahaha</span>
