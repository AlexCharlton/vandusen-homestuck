CURRENT carcinoGeneticist [CCG] RIGHT NOW opened memo on board TEAM ADORABLOODTHIRSTY.



CCG: THIS IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO START A NEW MEMO.

CCG: IN FACT IT'S A BETTER TIME THAN ANY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF CHAT CLIENT PREDESTINATION I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE DO I.

CCG: FUCK.

CCG: IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S STILL A GOOD TIME TO DO IT.

CCG: PEOPLE, WE NEED TO GET ORGANIZED HERE.

CCG: SHIT IS GETTING SERIOUS.

CCG: WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON OPERATION REGISURP, A CUNNING PLAN DEVISED BY DOUBLE ARCHAGENT JACK NOIR TO EXILE THE BLACK QUEEN.

CCG: WE WILL NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR THIS, EVEN THE IDIOTS.

CCG: AND ONCE AGAIN, A REMINDER

CCG: DO NOT TROLL ME IN THESE MEMOS FROM ANY POINT IN TIME OR IT'S AN INSTA-BAN.

CCG: ALSO A NOTE TO MY FUTURE SELF

CCG: IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING SMUG, DO ME A FAVOR AND SHOVE A THROB STALK IN IT.

CCG: JUST SIT THERE PATIENTLY AND WAIT FOR ME TO BECOME YOU IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME, THUS IMPROVING YOUR INTELLECT DRASTICALLY.

CCG: OR, INTELLECTS PLURAL.

CCG: I FORGOT, THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU FUCKERS OUT THERE.

CCG: ALL OF YOU, JUST ZIP YOUR CHUTES. I MEAN SERIOUSLY, LIKE THERE'S NOTHING BETTER TO DO IN THE FUTURE???

CCG: IT'S THE FUTURE FOR GOD'S SAKE, A REALM OF ENDLESS FUCKING POSSIBILITIES.

CCG: NOW

CCG: BEFORE WE GET STARTED, LET'S TAKE A TOLL OF THE SITUATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

CCG: *MY* POINT IN TIME.

CCG: WHO'S IN SO FAR, WHO'S NOT, ETCETERA.

CCG: NO, DUDE, DON'T DRINK THAT SHIT. IF IT WERE UP TO HIM WE WOULD ALL DRINK FAYGO AT ONCE IN SOME RITUALISTIC RAP CLOWN SUICIDE PACT.

CCG: BUT INSTEAD OF COMMITTING SUICIDE THE THING THAT WE ALL ACCOMPLISH IS BECOMING INSTANTANEOUS ASSHOLES WITH AWFUL TASTE.

FCA: i mean

CCG: OK.

CCG: IS EVERYBODY GOOD?

CCG: JUST GONNA SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE, LOCAL TIME, AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS ANY SHIT THEY WANT TO SCRAPE OFF THEIR BULGE ON TO MY CLEAN NUTRITION PLATEAU.

CCG: NOBODY?

CCG: GREAT, WONDERFUL.

CCG: I NOW OFFICIALLY DECLARE THE NONSENSE PORTION OF THIS MEMO TO BE OVER.

CCG: THIS DECREE SHALL BE BINDING AND LASTING.

CCG: BACK TO PLANNING REGISURP.

CCG: BEAR DOWN EVERYBODY, THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT, THERE IS A QUEEN ON THE LOOSE AND WE'VE GOT TO SHOW A BITCH THE DOOR.

FUTURE arachnidsGrip [FAG] 609 HOURS FROM NOW responded to memo.

CCG: HEY CAN FUTURE YOU MIND-PREVENT ME FROM HITTING THE BAN BUTTON?

CCG: I'M GENUINELY CURIOUS! GO AHEAD, TRY TO STOP ME I DARE YOU.

FAG: I'm not going to try, I'm just here to say this whole thing is ridiculous.

FAG: We didn't really need you to pretend to 8e a little angry general to get any of this done.

FAG: We kicked the queen out of there no sweat! It was easy. In fact, I did most of the work myself, right 8efore I found all the treasure and scaled all the rungs.

CCG: OH, ALL OF THEM YOU SAY?

CCG: FASCINATING.

CCG: HEY FORGET THE BAN BUTTON, USE YOUR MIND POWERS TO HELP ME LOCATE THE DESPERATELY ATTEMPT TO GIVE A SHIT BUTTON. WHOOPS WE BOTH FAILED, IT DOESN'T EXIST.

FAG: Hey, I'm gone. I just think you should relax.

FAG: You were wound up so tight through the whole adventure, and now here in the present you're a8out to explode. It's insuffera8le!

CCG: EVERYBODY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?? SUPERFUTURE VRISKA HAS AN IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON FOR US ALL.

CCG: WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUR PRESENT RESPONSIBILIES AND OBLIGATIONS!

CCG: BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT, IN THE FUTURE ALL THAT STUFF ALREADY HAPPENED. WE'RE OFF THE FUCKING HOOK!

CCG: TIME TO RELAX. LET'S ALL CRAWL INTO OUR COCOONS AND GET BUSY STIMULATING OUR AUTOEROGENOUS SHAME GLOBES.

CCG: FIRST ONE TO START A WANK FIRE GETS A SHINY BOONDOLLAR.

CCG: THIS IS AN ORDER FROM YOUR LEADER.

FAG: Hahahahahahahaha.

CCG banned FAG from responding to memo.

CCG: LATER, FAG.

CCG: TOO BAD THE ACRONYM WASN'T "HAG" INSTEAD, IT WOULD HAVE SUITED YOU MUCH BETTER.

CCG: INSTEAD OF THAT NONSENSE WORD

CCG: MAYBE ITS ASSOCIATION WITH YOU WILL COLLOQUIALLY CAUSE IT TO TAKE ON A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

CCG: MAYBE FAG WILL BE "THE NEW BURN!" EVEN THOUGH IT REALLY MEANS NOTHING IN OUR LANGUAGE.

CCG: I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS STUPID, FORGET IT

CCG: OK I'M RAMBLING HERE, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

CCG: FUTURE ME, DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE WEIGH IN ON THIS, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
