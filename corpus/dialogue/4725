CT: D --> I'm attempting to determine what it is that ranks humans in their class stru%ure

CT: D --> I'd assumed the color of your b100d would serve as the basis for placement in the hierarchy, as would be e%pected and natural, but I was mistaken

CT: D --> I was similarly in error believing the color of what you type corresponds with the color of your b100d

TG: it does bro

TG: my bloods red

CT: D --> Well, obviously

CT: D --> I understand that now, I'm not a f001

TG: on earth class is sorted out by who can drop the most delirious flow

CT: D --> I see

CT: D --> So, in other words, a sort of b100d letting ritual

CT: D --> To assess whose pulse is steadiest and thus whose flow is the most STRONG

TG: no

TG: well yeah

TG: verbal pulse

TG: rap battles

TG: the kings of wordtech ascend to godhood and look down on us patriarchally like urban watermarks in the sky

TG: this is like

TG: our religion man

TG: its fucking serious business its like what our whole culture revolves around

CT: D --> Really

CT: D --> So your social e%elons are dictated by the noble artform of the ancient slam poets

CT: D --> Or the Earth equivalent

TG: yeah well

TG: used to be dictated

TG: til the rapocalypse happened

TG: i still believe though

TG: in my heart so long as it keeps thumping the righteous beat

TG: subwoofing out devotion every which way

TG: that he will come

TG: our savior

TG: was foretold hed come after meteors show up to drop it like its hot

TG: and hed gather up the ashes of our civilization and lift it like its heavy

TG: fuck im tearing up my ishades are gonna fry

CT: D --> I believe

CT: D --> That this is probably nonsense

CT: D --> I've already been hornswoggled repeatedly by your comrades, who I quite reasonably mistook for your superiors in b100dline

CT: D --> Your race makes a habit of deception, and I will not tolerate it

CT: D --> You will stop

CT: D --> I command that all verbal misdire%ion and hoofbeastplay will cease during my communications, is that understood

TG: hahahahaha

TG: douche

CT: D --> Did I say something entertaining

TG: if youre gonna spit that kind of bravado at me im just saying put it in rhyme

TG: lets hear what you got tooly mcsnoothole

CT: D --> I try to stay engaged with many aristocratic practices

CT: D --> But I'm not much of a poet

TG: come on

CT: D --> My poems are private

TG: whatever dude

TG: deprivatize them

CT: D --> If you're prepared to be particularly forceful about it

CT: D --> I may be suitably disgusted to comply

TG: just

TG: take whatevers in there

TG: that brorage lust youre feelin

TG: turn that bitch inside out like a broke ass millionaires pockets

CT: D --> Yes

CT: D --> Those are the sorts of assertive statements which could get me

CT: D --> Flowing

TG: alright

TG: weird but alright

TG: you sound wound up

TG: but my gears are airtight

TG: steer clear a the seer and the knight if youre scared of unfair fights

TG: youll drop like the staircase impaired, seein em spareds a fair fuckin rare sight

TG: for poor eyes like that millionaire whos pockets i mocked earlier

TG: hes paradoxically me but richer and surlier

TG: broke as his sword before his stock picks skyrocketed

TG: worth more than all the chests lockpicked and gold croc bricks and boonbucks i pickpocketed

TG: fillin folios with millions im milkin to pad out my pockets

TG: more chock full than sad trollian villains cloggin my blocklist

TG: so thoughtful to popul-

TG: -ate my slate with propositions to copulate to a spate of hemoerotic hotpix

TG: which i posit you got shit of that nature in spades

TG: as my shades got you locked in

TG: spyin a guy whos eyed more cocks and dicks than i got clocks and they got ticks

CT: D --> Just a thought. Let's mock a topic with less awfulness

CT: D --> If you'd use the e%cuse to be less culturally myopic, what are your views on abuse to the walking apocrypha

CT: D --> Would you choose if duly cued to put your bruising clop to a flock of naughty roboti%

TG: ahaha wow YES

TG: dont really understand that but yes

TG: ok hold that thought im gonna pull this fuckin sword out of the thing
