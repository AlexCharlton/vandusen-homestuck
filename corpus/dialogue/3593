<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: man, i don't know how i feel about that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't really like the idea of capering around her room while she's asleep, it feels weird.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i'm going to wake her up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: dude no come on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: shes out like a light anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: a future thing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah</span>
