TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up

EB: man, i don't know how i feel about that!

EB: i don't really like the idea of capering around her room while she's asleep, it feels weird.

EB: i'm going to wake her up.

TG: dude no come on

TG: shes out like a light anyway

TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep

EB: a future thing?

TG: yeah

TG: shit doesnt get more clear than that

EB: well, yeah, she won't wake up.

EB: so i guess so.

EB: but i'm not snooping!!!

TG: fine dont

TG: but here just do this one thing

TG: see those two notebooks on the floor behind you

EB: yeah.

EB: they look sorta like journals.

EB: i don't think i should read those!

TG: you dont have to read them im not telling you to

TG: what kind of prying tool do you take me for

TG: just pick them up

TG: you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now

EB: uh, ok.
