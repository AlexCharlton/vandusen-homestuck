AA: were we ever really friends

AG: Yeah!!!!!!!!

AG: I don't know. I felt like we were even if you didn't think so.

AG: I guess I'm not very good at acting like a friend. Or saying stuff like, hey friend! You're my friend! It doesn't really occur to me.

AG: 8ut we were! Why would you play with me if you didn't think I was your friend?

AA: i d0nt remember

AG: Uh, okay?

AG: Haha. Pretty odd!

AA: s0rry

AG: That's cool, you can ri88it if you want. In a weird way it almost makes you sound normal!

AG: So what now? I guess you and Equius co-lead since he managed to usurp me. That cunning 8astard.

AG: I guess I follow you into the game instead? Fine 8y me! I'll follow you guys. Just give me my orders, 8oss.
