GG: heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky

GG: he looks frozen solid too

GG: so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???

GA: Yes That Should Work

GA: Make A Note Of The Coordinates

GA: When You Travel To Interact With Your Cloned Subjects You Are Also Taking The Opportunity To Explore And Discover New Habitats

GA: As Well As New Species Of Frogs For Your Terminal To Track

GA: Its Efficient To Go Adventuring In This Fashion While You Are Waiting For Your Young Clones To Mature

GG: that sounds like fun!!!!!!!

GA: Yes Its A Lot Of Fun

GA: It Is Also Extremely Time Consuming

GA: Unlike Some Appearifiers In The Veil This One Is Locked To The Present Moment

GA: You Cannot Use It As A Window Into The Future Or Past And Isolate Frogs Whose Futures Are Certain And Therefore Most Paradoxifiable

GA: Means Of Expedition Are Limited

GA: I Suppose You Could Use Time Travel To Accelerate The Process

GA: But You Would Need To Establish Weeks Worth Of Stable Time Loops

GA: I Think It Would Be An Overly Elaborate And Dangerous Undertaking Personally And Anyone Who Would Attempt Such A Thing Is Reckless

GA: I Wouldnt Advise It

GG: hmmmmm

GG: k hang on while i clone this fella.....
