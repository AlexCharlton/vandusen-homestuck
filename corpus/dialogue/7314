<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Oh, puleashe. You KNOW you have to tall me now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: The Feelings You Are Having Are Actually Perfectly Normal Within The Framework Of Our Quadrant Based Romantic Tradition</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: I Dont Know If They Can Be Felt Naturally By Humans But The Way You Are Viewing Their Relationship Would Be Quite A Standard Response On Alternia</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: And Can Be Quite Laborious To Maintain</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: But It Served A Very Important Social Purpose For My People</span>
