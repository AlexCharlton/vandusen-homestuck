EB: hey vriska!

EB: ok, i still cannot find my nanna up here, so now i am just installing this game.

EB: what are you up to?

AG: John! What the hell. There are so many things wrong with what you just said.

AG: First of all, who told you you could just hassle me without warning like this? That's not how this works!

EB: why not? you guys do it all the time.

AG: Yes, 8ecause we are trolling you! Those are the rules. We get to 8ug you any time we feel like, and you have to sit there and t8ke it like a chump.

EB: bluh...

AG: I am too 8usy to 8e fielding your nonsense at the drop of one of your a8surd human hats. I have a ridiculous num8er of irons in the fire. You will speak to me only when I am ready to contact you, is that clear????????

EB: that's dumb. i'm going to talk to you whenever i want!

AG: Secondly, I am very pissed off that you figured out my name.

EB: well, i didn't know it was your name for sure until you just told me now.

EB: so, haha.

AG: Dammit!

AG: Who told you?

EB: heheh, i am not telling.

EB: a true wise guy never reveals his tricks.

AG: I will find out who told you. And then I will m8ke them p8y.

EB: nuh uh!

EB: anyway, i was just wondering if you had a chance to watch that awesome video i linked you to?

AG: What video?

EB: you know...

EB: the one about the renegade hero who busted loose from the slammer to save the day.

AG: John, the way you descri8e movies makes them sound extremely stupid. Why would I want to watch this crap????????

EB: just do it, you won't be sorry.

EB: i mean, when you are not so busy and have less irons in the fire or whatever.

EB: ok, i am starting this game now and saving jade, like a street tough maverick with nothing to lose.

EB: see ya, vriska!

AG: XXXX|

EB: oh, damn...

AG: ::::?
