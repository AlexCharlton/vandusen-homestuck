GT: Youre right he sure does look to be in a thorough pickle.

GT: My impulse is to message him now but youre kind of bogarting his chumhandle so i dont even know how to do that?

TT: He's concentrating on some things happening on Derse at the moment.

TT: Not to mention some uncannily similar things going down on Earth, which it seems you have noticed.

TT: He's also talking to someone, trying to appraise the exact nature of the threat.

TT: Unfortunately as a carbon based life form, his comprehension of the situation is taking shape at a somewhat slower pace than the jaw-dropping speed of post-singularity cognition.

TT: So I am taking the reins and accelerating the plan on his behalf, while he's busy with the corporeal stuff as usual.

GT: Ok then how do i help?

TT: Deploy all the devices in the Phernalia Registry. Ideally in places that aren't stupid.

TT: Do it quickly, so he can activate the entry sequence and escape.

GT: I will have them deployed lickety split.

GT: That flaming ocean is nothing to sneeze at.

GT: It is fixing to burn his... uh. Skeletal highrise thing right the heck down.

TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat.

GT: Oh. Are more robots on the way?

TT: No.

TT: Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?

GT: Um...

TT: Are you blind? It's right there, Jake.

GT: Oh!

GT: You mean the super deadly red shit?
