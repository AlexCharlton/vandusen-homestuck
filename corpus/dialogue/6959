    <span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Eureka!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre right he sure does look to be in a thorough pickle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: My impulse is to message him now but youre kind of bogarting his chumhandle so i dont even know how to do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's concentrating on some things happening on Derse at the moment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Not to mention some uncannily similar things going down on Earth, which it seems you have noticed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's also talking to someone, trying to appraise the exact nature of the threat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Unfortunately as a carbon based life form, his comprehension of the situation is taking shape at a somewhat slower pace than the jaw-dropping speed of post-singularity cognition.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So I am taking the reins and accelerating the plan on his behalf, while he's busy with the corporeal stuff as usual.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ok then how do i help?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Deploy all the devices in the Phernalia Registry. Ideally in places that aren't stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do it quickly, so he can activate the entry sequence and escape.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I will have them deployed lickety split.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That flaming ocean is nothing to sneeze at.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It is fixing to burn his... uh. Skeletal highrise thing right the heck down.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Are more robots on the way?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Um...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Are you blind? It's right there, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You mean the super deadly red shit?</span>
