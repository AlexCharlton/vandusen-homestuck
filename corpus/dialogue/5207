GA: I Had Imagined I Would Hatch The New Grub On A Planet In Your Universe

GA: And When That Became Impossible I Quickly Lost Hope

GA: I Assumed It Would Remain Locked In Its Card Forever

GA: Which Could Only Be Opened When The Orb Was Meant To Be Used

GA: But Then I Found Something Quite Unexpected When I Was Exploring This Lab

GA: I Found A Key

GA: It Was Deep In The Meteor

GA: And As I Suspected It Released The Orb

GA: Which Was Really Confusing To Me For A While

GA: Until I Realized What It Meant

GA: Which Is So Obvious Im Amazed I Didnt Think Of It Right Away

GG: what!

GA: It Means I Am Supposed To Use It Now

GA: To Hatch The Grub In The Heart Of This Meteor
