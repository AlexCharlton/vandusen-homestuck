CG: HE WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH US TO OVERTHROW THE BLACK QUEEN.

CG: SO I SAID OK.

CG: AND NOW I NEED YOUR HELP.

AG: Um, ok.

AG: I can try.

AG: What does he know?

CG: HE RECENTLY GOT HOLD OF SOME INTEL REGARDING A WEAKNESS IN THE QUEEN'S DEFENSES.

CG: I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN THAT.

CG: BUT WE'VE GOT TO HURRY AND GET STARTED ON THIS THING, OR IT COULD GET KIND OF AWKWARD.

AG: Awkward? What do you mean?

CG: I MEAN HE'S JUST STANDING HERE NOW.

CG: WAITING FOR ME I GUESS.

CG: BUT IT'S OK, I THINK HE'S PRETTY MUCH SETTLED DOWN.

AG: Settled down?

CG: WELL, HE STABBED ME ONCE.

AG: Oh, only once!

AG: Are you sure you should trust him? I don't know if I would, 8ut hey I'm not the leader.

CG: NO, NO, IT'S COOL.

CG: HE'S COOL, IT'S FINE I DON'T REALLY MIND THE STABBING, IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.

CG: WELL OK I'M PRETTY SURE HE MEANT TO STAB ME.

CG: BUT I KIND OF THINK THAT'S LIKE

CG: THE WAY HE GREETS PEOPLE?

AG: This game is so stupid.

CG: IN ANY CASE I THINK HE'S PROBABLY ALL STABBED OUT.

AG: Whew!!!!!!!!

AG: Oh, man.

AG: Since you're 8leeding I should ask Terezi what color your 8lood is.

CG: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

CG: SHE CAN'T SEE ME OR SMELL ME OR ANYTHING, I'M WAY OUT OF MY HIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET.

AG: Ok, then I'll ask Jack.

CG: NO, JACK WON'T TELL, I MADE HIM PROMISE HE WOULDN'T TELL.

AG: Dammit! Stupid lousy tightlipped sta8happy dou8le agents. 

AG: Doesn't Trollian have some kind of viewport feature? 

CG: YEAH BUT I'M PRETTY SURE ONLY SOLLUX KNOWS HOW TO SET THAT UP, AND HE'S BEEN INCOMMUNICADO FOR HOURS FOR SOME REASON.

CG: ANYWAY THAT WHOLE FEATURE SEEMS TOTALLY INVASIVE AND LARGELY POINTLESS TO ME, SO JUST FORGET IT.

AG: Yeah ok, here we are a8out to em8ark on an espionage mission. A spying tool sounds totally useless!

AG: Another gr8 point, captain.

CG: WHATEVER.

CG: JUST GET YOUR ASS IN HERE SO WE CAN DETHRONE THIS GODDAMN QUEEN.

CG: IT'LL MEAN ONE LESS GOD BOSS WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

AG: Fine, I'll be right there.

AG: Just try not to lose too much of your mystery blood and die.
