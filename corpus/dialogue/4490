FAA 2:16 HOURS FROM NOW opened memo on board r0ad t0 the und0ing.



FAA: this private b0ard will and has already served as a l0g 0f past events f0r future selves t0 rec0rd and a guide 0f future events f0r past selves t0 f0ll0w

FAA: i d0nt kn0w which half 0f its r0le has been 0r will be m0re imp0rtant

FAA: p0ssibly neither is critical since deviati0n fr0m the c0urse is m0stly imp0ssible and reflecti0n 0n its traversal is c0mpletely irrelevant

FAA: but im typing this anyway

FAA: because im b0red again
