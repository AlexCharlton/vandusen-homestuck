uu: NOW THROW IT IN THE FIRE.

TT: Screw you.

TT: I'm not chucking the C-man into a flaming ocean.

uu: IT IS THE uLTIMATE ABOMINATION.

uu: YOuR JuJu MAY BE DEAD AND HOLLOW. BuT SOMETHING TELLS ME.

uu: THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EVEN MORE DANGEROuS.

uu: DISCARD IT AT ONCE. TREASuRE BEYOND COMPREHENSION IS YOuR REWARD.

TT: No.

TT: Keep your treasure.

uu: AH HA HA. AS IF IT IS NOT INEVITABLY DESTINED TO FALL FROM YOuR HuMAN FINGERS.

uu: AND BECOME ERASED AS YOuR uNIVERSE DIES.

uu: DIDN'T I MENTION.

uu: A JuJu CAN NEVER BE TRuLY COPIED.

uu: IF TWO APPEAR TO EXIST. SuCH AS ONE IN REALITY AND ONE IN YOuR DREAMS.

uu: IT IS ONLY AN ILLuSION. EITHER NEVER TRuE. OR SOON TO BE CORRECTED.

uu: THERE CAN ONLY EVER BE ONE.

TT: Well, I'm not tossing him, so that's that.

uu: YOu WILL THOuGH.

uu: ANYWAY. YOu TOOK IT OuT.

uu: I WILL DEEM THAT COMPLIANCE ENOuGH.

uu: AND REWARD YOu WITH MY GRATITuDE.

uu: I THINK INSTEAD OF THANKS THOuGH. I WILL CALL IT. A "BIRTH DAY PRESENT"?

TT: It isn't my birthday.

uu: NOT YOuRS JERK.

TT: Oh. So it's your birthday today?

uu: IT WILL BE.

uu: IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN.

TT: How cryptically meaningless.

TT: And you continue to struggle with human customs. You don't give other people presents on your own birthday.

TT: Anyway, just tell me what it is.

uu: IT IS A "WORK OF FINE ART".

uu: THE VERY FIRST I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED.

uu: YOu WILL FIND IT SuITABLY CONVEYS OuR SPECIAL BOND.

TT: Let's see.

uu: http://tinyurl.com/DIRKTHISISuS

TT: Uh.

TT: What the fuck am I looking at here?

uu: DON'T YOu SEE?? IT IS uS! YOu AND ME.

uu: WE ARE GETTING PERHAPS A LITTLE TOO. *FRIENDLY.* IF YOu WILL. HAA. HAA.

TT: I... really don't see.

TT: What do you mean? This fucking scribbly bullshit is us? Are we shaking hands or something?

uu: WHOA! WHOAAAAAAAAAAA! DuDE. HAHA. FuCK.

uu: YOu HAVE AN EVEN DIRTIER MIND THAN ME. I'M FuCKING OuTCLASSED BY YOuR REPREHENSIBLE IMAGINATION ONCE AGAIN.

uu: I CAN'T SAY I'M SuRPRISED.

TT: So, it's just us? What about The Bitches?

TT: I thought you found a scarcity of The Bitches to be all but unacceptable.

uu: THE BITCHES AS YOu CAN PLAINLY SEE HAVE BEEN FAR FROM NEGLECTED. LOOK.

uu: THEY'RE RIGHT THERE ASSHOLE. THE BITCHES APPEAR TO BE. *AHEM.* RATHER ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY???

uu: OOOOOOOOOOOH. 

uu: SOO GNARLY. 

uu: TO IMAGINE. WHAT FILTH MY OWN HAND HAS WROuGHT.

TT: Yeah. Gnarly is about right.

TT: This is utter shit. You know that, don't you?

TT: Please don't tell me you are actually incapable of understanding how bad this drawing is.

uu: WHAT. NO. FuCK YOu.

uu: IT'S PRETTY GOOD. AT LEAST FOR A FIRST TRY.

TT: If you actually think this even qualifies as a drawing, I'm going to have to say you are literally the worst artist who has ever existed.

uu: WHAT THE FuCK. THIS IS HOW YOu TREAT. MY "BIRTH DAY THANK YOu GIFT"??

TT: That's not a thing either.

TT: You must have some wires crossed between your left brain and right brain. Like a weird perceptual disorder. Or something like that.

TT: It's actually kind of fascinating that you think you achieved something visually coherent or recognizable.

uu: THIS IS OuTRAGEOuS.

TT: Anyway. Got to go.

TT: Your drawing blows.

TT: Later.
