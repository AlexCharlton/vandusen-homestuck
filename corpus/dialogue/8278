    <span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Oh, nothing much</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Just enjoying the good life</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> One which quite lu%uriously involves both having a corporeal body, and not being dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I have been delighting myself with some truly kickbottom internal monodialogues</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Did you know that, even though technically I knew this already, I find myself astounded to meditate upon the fact that human beings are capable of lactation?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Isn't that <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_fucking.gif" border="0" /> incredible, Dirk?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I mean, when one really thinks about it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> To have such convenient access to fresh milk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> The mare thought of it, I must say puts a little giddyup in my phantom legs</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> And yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I must admit the notion of lactic discharge jetting from one's swollen pectoral masses...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> It strikes me as positively indecorous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> My horseguy robosweat is running cold just pondering the depravity of it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Uuuugh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yet fascinatingly, this ability only manifests itself in human females</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> As opposed to how one would reasonably e%pect dairy to originate, which is from the corpulent udder of a sublimely chiseled male musclebeast</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Or failing that, certain species found within the butler genus</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> As a former simulation of a human who has recently been given reason to have hella opinions on milk production, I think the way females have cornered this boon is the height of biological injustice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Have you ever dwelt upon this cruelty, dude esquire?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Your silence speaks volumes to your interest, so I'll keep talking about this a lot</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I will have to confess that my Alternian half boggles at the anatomical incongruities between our races with respect to dairy secretion</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Really, he had no idea that's what those were for</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Female trolls of course have them as well, but they are certainly not meant for supplying the young with nourishment</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Actually, and this trivia will surely wet your whistle for additional such facts, those voluptuous anatomical features have a number of significant purposes, biologically speaking</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I shall now e%plicate for you these purposes in assiduous detail</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: I don't want to hear any of this!</span>
