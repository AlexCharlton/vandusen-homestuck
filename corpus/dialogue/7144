TT: Jake.

TT: It seems you are going to have to kiss me.

GT: What?????

GT: Dude what is going on...

GT: Is this... is this really dirks head???

GT: What happened to him!

TT: Dirk's dead, Jake.

TT: You have to bring him back to life.

GT: How?!

TT: I already told you.

TT: If you want Dirk to live.

TT: The odds that you are going to have to make out with this severed head are so high, I literally just confiscated their bong.

GT: Uhh.

TT: I refuse to believe my statement has left you unconvinced. The very notion is absurd. Now hurry up and kiss me.

TT: Chop chop. 

GT: I dont understand!

GT: Are you saying i have to kiss him... like uh... on the lips... while you stare at me through his sunglasses like a weirdo??

TT: Yes.

GT: That doesnt make any sense!

GT: Can you actually tell me whats going on?! What happened to him?

TT: I told you, Jake.

TT: Dirk is dead.

TT: He is lying on the floor of Roxy's room, headless, four hundred and thirteen years in the future, while the universe is about to be destroyed.

TT: If you don't kiss me soon, he will be dead forever.

GT: So...

GT: If i kiss him his headless body will hop up and start prancing about or...

GT: Will he grow a new head???

TT: No. His dream self will take over as the new Dirk.

TT: But only if you hurry up and do it.

GT: But like...

GT: If hes dead in the future...

GT: How does kissing him NOW bring him back? How does that work?

TT: Yeah, great idea. Let's roll up our sleeves on nuanced metatemporal mechanics with the concussion-addled kid in micro-shorts.

TT: Leave the synchronization issues to me, ok?

TT: I have everything under control.

TT: Now pucker up.

GT: Wait...

GT: Are you behind these shenanigans?

GT: Did you plan this auto responder??????????
