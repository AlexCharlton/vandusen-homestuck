GT: Have i mentioned what a top notch friend you are jane?

GG: Yes.

GG: As a matter of fact you have.

GT: Now please dont take me as saying im about to go leaping into his arms or anything.

GG: Heh.

GT: That would be a bit brash.

GT: Haha could you imagine??

GG: Whee!

GT: But my thought process sort of went like this.

GT: Hes been my best friend forever and ive always liked him a lot as a bro.

GT: And years ago i used to joke around with him that we would probably be totally into each other if he was a girl.

GT: But of course that was before i started to realize he was probably serious about those feelings for me regardless.

GT: Heheh come to think of it maybe that was unwittingly poor form on my part kind of leading him on or something?

GG: Whoops!!

GT: But then...

GT: Later i started thinking.

GT: Maybe i was being kind of unfair to him in the first place?

GT: I mean by saying we would be a good match only if he was a girl.

GT: Like is that last condition there really all THAT important?

GT: Does that make sense?

GG: Hmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
