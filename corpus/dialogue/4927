TG: like an anti piracy measure

TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure

GG: anti spam?

TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for

TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason

TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like

TG: a potted plant

TG: that would be fucking mayhem

GG: yeah obviously!

TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box

TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam

TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit

GG: oh nooo

TG: basically robots are in control now

TG: which is good news and bad news

TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us

GG: whats the good news?

TG: thats also the good news

GG: dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here

TG: whats it look like

TG: im duplicating my server disc
