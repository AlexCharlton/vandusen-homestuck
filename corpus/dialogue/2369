TG: john said your house was burning down are you on fire yet or what

TT: No. For now I have retired to the safety of a smaller building which is much closer to the forest fire threatening my residence.

TG: oh well thats a relief

TG: john told me to get the game to help get you out of there so im working on that now

TT: Working on it?

TG: yeah my bros copy long story

TG: hey

TG: dont tell john this but i think he might have been right about the puppets

TG: theyre sort of starting to freak me out a little

TT: You're referring to your brother's collection?

TG: i mean dont get me wrong i think its cool and all

TG: the semi-ironic puppet thing or whatever

TG: or semi-semi ironic

TG: man i dont even know

TG: im just starting to think some of this shit is going a little far and its kind of fucked up

TT: I've seen his websites.

TT: I like them.

TG: haha yeah well YOU WOULD

TG: oh man i wish lil cal wouldnt look at me like that

TG: with those dead eyes jesus

TG: sometimes i dream that hes real and hes talking to me and i wake up in a cold sweat and basically flip the fuck out

TT: Interesting...

TG: oh god why did i just tell you my dream

TG: youre going to have a field day with that

TT: I am currently scrawling notes furiously into one of the many psychoanalysis journals I maintain for you. Published papers forthcoming.

TT: Because, you know, it's not like either of us have anything better to do at the moment than to evaluate each other's radically debilitating pathologies.

TG: yeah im gonna get moving

TG: oh have you heard from john

TG: hes not answering me

TT: He won't answer me either.

TT: But I am watching him.

TT: I suspect he is preoccupied with the fact that he just had a bucket of water dumped on his head by the ghost of his dead grandmother, who also happens to be dressed like a clown.

TG: hahahahaha

TG: alright im out

TG: later
