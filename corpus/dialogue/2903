TT: What are you planning?

EB: oh whoa hi!

EB: oh...

EB: gonna make some stuff.

EB: are you ok? hasn't your house been on fire for like...

EB: five hours now?

TT: No, that was the nearby forest, which up until quite recently would have been best described as "on fire".

TT: But you may be excited to learn that just as recently, my house finally notched that achievement.

EB: wow, congrats i guess?

TT: Thank you. Have you seen Dave?

EB: nah.

EB: his bro is probably busy kicking his ass.

EB: that's probably all there is to say on the matter.

TT: Ok.

TT: I'm going to start putting this grist to use too.

TT: Let's be sparing with the frivolous knickknack breeding and focus on getting you up to the gate, ok?

EB: yeah, ok i hear you, but...

EB: i think we'll have plenty. i've been killing imps all over the house and now its lousy with gushers.

TT: Gushers?

EB: i mean grist.

EB: serves them right for ruining my posters. the bastards.

TT: Which posters?

EB: don't you see? my sweet movie posters. look at them, they're fucking ruined.

TT: John.

EB: ??????

TT: Are you suggesting that imps are responsible for defacing your movie posters?

EB: uh, YEAH?

TT: Your posters have looked like that ever since I first saw your room.

TT: The moment we started playing this game.

TT: I thought you had defaced them ironically to mock your father's interests.

TT: John?

TT: ...?

EB: VERY FUNNY ROSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
