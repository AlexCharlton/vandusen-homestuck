AG: Psssssssst.

AG: Hey 8rave leader.

CG: OH MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME.

AG: Can I join your team?

CG: YES I'M GLAD YOU ASKED, BECAUSE THERE IS A WIDE OPEN SLOT FOR THE MOST VILE BACKSTABBING SOCIOPATH WHO EVER LIVED.

CG: YOU REALLY HELPED ME OUT OF A JAM BY STEPPING FORWARD.

AG: Vile 8acksta88ing sociopath? Karkat, did you copy and p8ste that phrase directly from your personal ad descri8ing what you are looking for in a lady?

CG: HA HA HA!

CG: MORE CAGEY CUTESY BULLSHIT.

CG: LIKE I'M NOT UP TO MY LOBE STEM WITH THAT ALREADY HAVING TO DEAL WITH TEREZI.

CG: YOU BOTH MUST HAVE BEEN INSUFFERABLE WHEN YOU WERE A TEAM.

CG: YOUR OPPONENTS PROBABLY ALL JUST TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF PUTTING UP WITH YOUR FANGY GRINNED DRIVEL.

CG: THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN WHEN THE SHIT HIT THE THRESHER.

AG: That's not a 8ad guess! 8ut man! Karkat you sure are giving me a hard time.

AG: I don't see how we're supposed to 8e 8ecoming friends if you recoil from my olive 8ranch like I'm twitching a mummified 8ovine phallus in your direction.

CG: BECOMING FRIENDS, WHAT THE FUCK.

CG: WE WILL NEVER BE FRIENDS, MORON.

AG: Not even h8 friends?

CG: NO. MORE LIKE TWITCHY EYED PROJECTILE VOMITING IN UTTER DISGUST FRIENDS, WHILE I PERFORATE MY BONE BULGE WITH A CULLING FORK.

AG: Yessssssss. I'll take it!

CG: GET LOST.

AG: Anyway, I was just joking a8out wanting to 8e on your team.

AG: I'm already on the 8lue team.

CG: OH! OH REALLY?????

CG: WAIT, LET ME COUNT OUT EIGHT OF THESE THINGS, HOLD ON. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

CG: THERE, I AM NOW AN ENORMOUS TOOL FOREVER.

AG: Yes, Aradia and I have an arrangement. We will 8e co-leaders.

AG: (But really I will 8e the leader! Heh heh. Shh! Don't tell anyone!)

AG: What do you think, Karkat? Can you take on two dangerous laaaaaaaadies at once?

CG: YAWN.

AG: Come on! Aren't you a little nervous that I will oppose you? You should 8e!

CG: NO YOU'RE JUST A RUN OF THE MILL LITTLE PSYCHO GIRL, A TROLL CAEGAR A DOZEN.

CG: I'LL BE TAKING APART THE BLUE TEAM WITH BRUTAL EFFICIENCY, YOU'LL SEE.

CG: YOU NEVER PLAYED ONE OF YOUR DUMB GAMES WITH ME SO YOU NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING WHAT I CAN DO.

CG: ENJOY THE SHOW, SWEETHEART.

CG: JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT USING YOUR MIND CONTROL TRICKS ON MY PLAYERS.

CG: REMEMBER YOUR TRUCE?

AG: Pshhhhhhhh. Those days are far 8ehind me.

AG: Anyway, I can't control just any8ody. They've got to 8e impressssssssiona8le. Like you!

CG: YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME.

AG: Sure I can. I just choose not to.

CG: YEAH OK.

AG: I find your mind totally unpalata8le to 8rowse. Looking into your 8rain is like pawing through a smelly dumpster.

AG: Full of 8roken glass and razor 8lades!

AG: And poop. D::::

CG: WHATEVER, DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

CG: I'VE GOT THE BETTER SCOURGE SISTER ON MY TEAM AND IF YOU BREAK YOUR TRUCE YOU'LL HAVE TO ANSWER TO HER.

CG: THE FUNNY THING IS SHE WAS ALWAYS WAY BETTER THAN YOU EVEN WITHOUT ANY POWERS.

CG: YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, I KNOW YOUR WHOLE STORY.

CG: YOU WERE ALWAYS JEALOUS SHE COULD MANIPULATE PEOPLE SO WELL WITHOUT RESORTING TO CHEAP MIND TRICKS.

CG: HAHA, I CAN TELL THIS BURNS YOU AND I CAN'T EVEN PAW THROUGH YOUR DUMPSTER!

CG: CHALK IT UP AS ANOTHER INFURIATING VICTORY FOR GUTTER BLOOD OVER ARISTOCRACY.

CG: OH WHAT'S THAT, NOTHING TO SAY?

CG: WOW SPEECHLESS I GUESS. YOU'RE PROBABLY CRYING RIGHT NOW. THAT WOULD MAKE MY FUCKING DAY.

CG: HEY LOOK AT ME BEING THE ONE TO TALK SHIT AT WARP SPEED THEN LOG OFF BEFORE YOU CAN REPLY.

CG: BYE, IDIOT.
