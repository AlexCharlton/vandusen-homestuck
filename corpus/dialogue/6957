TT: Hold up.

TT: Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.

GT: Oh why am i not surprised!

GT: Still no human dirk?

TT: Don't worry, you'll see him very soon. In a way.

GT: What is the change of plan?

TT: Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.

TT: Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.

GT: I see. Variables and what not.

GT: Lets cut to the chase! What do i do.

TT: Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades.

GT: Crucial upgrades huh?

GT: I dunno about crucial buddy i see you have trolled me with like 50 copies of this dumbfuck social media software for cool bros in hats but ok.

TT: Damn. Nothing gets by English.

TT: The guy is untrollable.

GT: Ok i installed it should i run it?

TT: Yes.

TT: You will be connecting with Dirk. I will have Jane connect with Roxy. Setting up the chain like this will be important.

GT: Sure if you say so.

TT: That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client Dirk is running.

TT: Do it quickly. His life depends on it.

GT: Great caesars ghost! Why didnt you say so.

GT: Ok done.

GT: Hey theres his room!
