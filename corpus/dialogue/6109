GG: The one covered in golden cities. Prospit, remember?

GT: Oh. Wouldnt it be prospits moon?

GG: Yes, you're right. It was the moon, actually. I could see the planet on the dark horizon.

GG: I was dressed in a golden dress, like a sort of nightgown, and I could fly. I left my bedroom, which was at the top of a tall tower. Surrounding me were the gold cities, just as described.

GG: Behind the skyline was darkness. But just above was a bright blue sky and puffy white clouds.

GT: That was skaia!

GG: Yes, probably.

GG: Are you sure you haven't woken up there before?

GT: Haha i WISH.

GT: I have received reports from jade about this as well. She liked to talk about her dreams on prospits moon a lot.

GG: I see. The impression I have developed is that this is supposed to be a real place, and all who dream there have shared experiences.

GG: Did Jade ever mention seeing us there?

GT: No but why would she? This was long before we were born! She was dreaming there like a hundred years ago or something.

GG: Hrmm. Anyway...
