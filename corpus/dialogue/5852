EB: i found it very deep in the palace dungeon. i was wandering for hours, following a horrible sound through the pipes.

EB: i could tell typheus was really close, because it was very loud here. it could only be the sound of him sleeping.

EB: i was so tempted to play it, but i didn't dare risk waking him up!

EB: pretty much by then i was sweating bullets at the thought of confronting him.

AG: You were right to 8e nervous. Denizens are incredi8ly powerful monsters. You had no chance whatsoever at this stage of the game.

AG: You might have stood a chance after I started helping you. 8ut Terezi really screwed you over 8y leading you here so early.

EB: yeah...

EB: i guess if i ever see her, i should thank her too.

AG: Why?

EB: because this was important.

AG: What was? Getting killed 8y a monster?

EB: well, yes. but not just that.

EB: the whole ruse was important!

EB: if i didn't make the decision to go, then dave would not be able to go back in time and fix things.

EB: in fact, if i didn't die here in this palace, we never would have been born in the first place!

AG: How could you know all that?

EB: this way...
