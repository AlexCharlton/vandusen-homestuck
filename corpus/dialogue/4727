CT: D --> It strikes me as an artifact rooted in universal lore of nobility

CT: D --> As valuable an asset as strength is

CT: D --> And as much as anyone with his wits is fond of being STRONG

CT: D --> Such weapons require finesse to operate

CT: D --> And surely in this case, to retrieve without damaging

CT: D --> Hence your no doubt frustrating restraint

TG: ok im kinda starting to wonder why youre bugging me now

TG: youre a fuckin creepy dude

CT: D --> E%cessive force will shatter such weapons

CT: D --> We both know this from e%perience

TG: what

CT: D --> The adult human who trained you

CT: D --> And taught you the ways of being STRONG

CT: D --> Remember

TG: you mean the guy who spent years beating my ass down with a puppet

TG: yeah i remember

CT: D --> Yes, and now, being learned in the ways of STRONGNESS

CT: D --> You like myself are unfortunately limited in the weaponry you may wield

CT: D --> Ironically the training which has ennobled you beyond others has made instruments of high b100d brittle in your hands

CT: D --> Hence the state of your favored weapon, hobbling your specibus

CT: D --> I know what this is like

TG: man

TG: im not that strong ok

TG: just cause i broke a cheap ass sword doesnt make me the fucking hulk

CT: D --> Oh

TG: what did you go around breaking a bunch of swords too

CT: D --> No

CT: D --> Bows

TG: how the fuck do you even wield a broken bow

TG: did you go around clubbing shit with the two halves

CT: D --> Yes

CT: D --> Sometimes
