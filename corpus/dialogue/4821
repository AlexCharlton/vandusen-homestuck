TT: John.

EB: blaaauuuuuuuuugh, what happened!!!!!

TT: You were sleeping.

EB: yes, i know!

EB: on the corner of my ghost bed!

EB: in the middle of an oil ocean!

EB: for some reason!!!

TT: Why were you sleeping?

TT: Everywhere I look, I see boys taking naps.

EB: um...

EB: i have no idea.

EB: i don't remember what happened, i was in the middle of helping jade...

EB: and then...

EB: i guess my bed crashed?

EB: and i got knocked out i guess.

EB: i was dreaming.

EB: i couldn't have been out for that long, because my dream was really short.

TT: You weren't.

TT: Ten minutes, I'd say.

TT: What were you dreaming about?

EB: i was on the battlefield again.

EB: but i did not have time to seek the treasure!

TT: I wouldn't imagine so.

EB: but...

EB: i did see a black guy wrapped up in my ghosty bed sheets.

EB: he was acting very suspicious.

TT: A black guy?

EB: oh...

EB: i do not mean like, an african american or anything.

EB: like bill cosby.

TT: Thanks for clearing that up.

EB: r.i.p. bill. :(

EB: this fellow had a hard black shell, like all the dead guys do.

EB: i followed him for a bit...

EB: and then some sorta ruckus transpired, and i woke up.

EB: and now jade won't answer!

EB: do you know if she's ok?

TT: She's fine.

TT: But you're not.

EB: i'm not?

TT: Remember how I said your planet was on fire?

EB: oh yeah...

EB: that didn't by any chance stop being a thing that was true, did it?

TT: It did not.

TT: Do you see that pinkish hue behind you, bleeding over the horizon?

EB: fuck!!!

EB: rose, this is all oil! it'll all just explode any second, won't it???

TT: I don't think the fire's rate of propagation is quite as fast as you're imagining.

TT: But the danger is still significant.

TT: Especially considering that your bed is sinking.

EB: fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!!!!!

TT: Relax.

TT: Look to your right.
