GG: so how does this cloning stuff work?

GA: Its Very Involved 

GA: Like I Said You Wont Have Time 

GA: In Fact It Probably Should Have Taken Considerably Longer Than It Took Me 

GA: I Was A Little Rushed 

GG: i want to try anyway!

GG: if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left

GA: Yes Youre Right 

GA: I Cant Imagine How You Can Complete The Objective In The Time Given 

GA: But Weirder Things Have Happened I Think 

GA: First Deploy The Pad 

GG: yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower

GA: Um 

GA: Why All The Way Up There 

GG: didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place?

GA: Yes Thats Right 

GG: my house is freezing now

GG: it ran on geothermal power before...

GG: and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet

GA: That Will Probably Change If You Light The Forge 

GA: But One Thing At A Time I Guess 

GG: yes i would like to hear about that later...

GG: but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium!

GG: lets see how dave is doing.....
