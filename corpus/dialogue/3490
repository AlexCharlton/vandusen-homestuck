AT: yES, hAAAAAH,

AT: i THOUGHT THE SAME THING ABOUT HOW ASININE THAT IS,

AT: sO, yOU KNOW THAT GUY, uMMM,

TT: I know that anyone committed to such an affectation could only be striving to mask a severe insecurity complex, and likely harbors a crisis of self-image.

TT: I've been known to lend my charitable attention to such people, but only "bossed around" by them insofar as the psychiatric professional has cause to humor the demented for analytical purposes.

TT: Or maybe as a lab chimp commands the zookeeper's interest in its shit by forcing him to duck under its trajectory now and then.

AT: oK, wOW, i DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS,

AT: bUT, uHH, i MEAN DAVE,

TT: Oh, that guy.

AT: i JUST WANT TO REALLY TRY TO BOTHER HIM, iT'S HARD,

TT: If you're trying to get his goat, you should know he only stocks the animal in the first place for ironic purposes.

AT: nO, i'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN HIS EARTH GOAT, bUT IF THAT WAS A FIGURE OF SPEECH THEN i GUESS THAT'S OK,

TT: Then we're agreed; you are hellbent upon literally seizing his shrill, bearded livestock.

TT: I'll assist you.

AT: uHH,

TT: If you really want to burn him, I recommend poetry.

AT: wHAT, pOETRY, aS IN LIKE THOSE HUMAN WORD BUNCHES,

TT: Yes. They are the most delicious bunches we have.

TT: I suggest you serve these crisp bunches of honey and verbal annihilation to him as part of a complete breakfast.

AT: oH, aND, wILL THIS BREAKFAST INJURE HIS SHRILL BARN BEAST,

AT: i MEAN THIS FIGURATIVELY, jUST TO BE CLEAR,

TT: A deft cluster-bombing of this sort will leave nothing wriggling from the razed earth.

AT: yOU MEAN, lIKE, tHE SURFACE OF AN OVERCOOKED PROTEIN OBJECT,

TT: Yeah.

TT: I suppose what I'm saying is this.

TT: Drop some hard, peer-reviewed motherfuckin' science on his ass.

TT: Some seriously government funded shit.

TT: It will destroy him.

AT: aAAAAHAHAHAH, yES,

AT: tHIS IS THE IDEA THAT i LIKE,

TT: Your obvious cunning with words should depants Strider with such vivid empyrean tempest, a nether-regional sonic boom is certain inevitability.

TT: But even so.

TT: Consider me at your disposal to help craft a comeuppance of such unqualified devastation, the angels will weep pearlstrings of little urban fellows cantillating an unbroken chorus of Oh Snaps.
