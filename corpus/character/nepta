3955
:33 < *ac saunters from her dark cave a little bit sl33py from the recent kill*
3955
:33 < *ac uses one of her mouths to lick the fresh blood off her paws*
3955
:33 < *and the other one to blow you a kiss!*
3955
:33 < *yes! ac finds that to be a most admirable use of a kiss!*
3955
:33 < *she thinks that goblin wishes n33d to come true too just like any other kind of purrsons wishes*
3955
:33 < *ac begs your pardon while she rips apart this tasty beast to prepare a meal for her cubs*
3955
:33 < uh oh!
3955
:33 < dont you dare!
3955
:33 < i mean
3955
:33 < *ac shouts dont you dare!*
3955
:33 < *indignantly*
3955
:33 < *ac says noooooooo and looks a bit crestfallen*
3955
:33 < *ac gets a clever idea to slake the majestic dragons mighty hunger*
3955
:33 < *she prepares the lions share of the slain armored cholerbear for gc*
3955
:33 < *ac pawses a moment and nods knowingly with a couple of smug grins on her face*
3955
:33 < *she confirms it is ind33d the bulliest of bears!*
3955
:33 < *but as it happens the really cute cub lands in a bush safe and sound, whew!*
3955
:33 < *ac crinkles up her nose and prepares for a really unprecedented marathon of baffling feline obstinacy*
3955
:33 < *her dragonyyydy suitor will make neither rhyme nor reason of her purrplexing behavior for even an instant!*
3955
:33 < oh! h33h33
3955
:33 < ok if you mean a computer game then yes that sounds like fun

:33 < team?
3955
:33 < who else is playing?
3955
:33 < oh

:33 < well it does sound like it will be a lot of fun but i think i should get purrmission first
3955
:33 < i know!
3955
:33 < but still im kind of scared of him and i think purrhaps its best to just run it by him first so there isnt a kerfuffle about it or anything
3955
:33 < i knooow
3955
:33 < but i dont think itll be a big deal
3955
:33 < ill just mention it casually and itll be fine im sure and then we can play in just a little bit!
3955
:33 < k!
4061
:33 < *ac perks up curiously*
4061
:33 < *she wiggles her rear end a bit and then chases something she s33s bounce into one of karkats shoes*
4061
:33 < i am???
4061

:33 < *ac twitches her friendly whiskers at ct*
4062
:33 < *ct purrplexes over where he put that important wrench that he n33ded for building a fancy robot or something*
4062
:33 < *he says, now where did that silly old wrench go??*
4062
:33 < *but oh look! ct p33ks around the corner to find that a very playful kitty has stolen the robot wrench and is now kicking it vigorously with her hind legs!*

:33 < i s33 right through your stupid act, who are you trying to kid!
4062
:33 < look how you go out of your way to use words that have x's in them so that you can use your silly purrcent signs

:33 < i dont s33 why karkat has to always be banned from these memos!
4529
:33 < what if he promises to behave himself?
4529
:33 < what if i talk to him in the past and told him he could post here as long as he was not purrticularly disagr33able?

:33 < beclaws this is the end of your timeline and i dont know what catpuns to you after this
5794
:33 < i mean happens to you after this, heheh, that one was kind of obtuse, sorry
5794
:33 < hmmmmmm thats a hard question
5794
:33 < ok imagine a long tempting strand of yarn
5794
:33 < now imagine instead of being made of wiggly enticing stuff, its made of what lets you exist
5794
:33 < and you are right at the twitching tip of it, dont you s33? look at the sky!
5794
:33 < thats fine, you dont have to try too hard
5794
:33 < all you have to know is its the scratch and im not a hundred purrcent sure what happens next fur you
5794
:33 < h33h33h33 :DD
5794
:33 < well you know roses friend john?
5794
:33 < imagine that he is using this great big circle like a really fun scratching post, and it makes all this light come out that changes everything
5794
:33 < just after he starts doing that the sky goes funny everywhere and then i cant s33 you anymore
5794
:33 < thats what it is
5794
:33 < im a bit nervous for you, especially since you remind me so much of someone i already lost
5794
:33 < but maybe youll be ok? i dont know
5794
:33 < you are a brave kitty, just like pounce was <33
5794
:33 < yes! she was amazing, i bet you and she would have gotten along famousely
5794
:33 < yes she smelled really good, and also, she was SUPER beautyifful.
5794
:33 < did you ever have someone nice back on earth who you loved?
5794
:33 < h33h33, of course you did. i mean a nice cat who was your matesprit?
5794
:33 < thats too bad
5794
:33 < but i bet lots of girl cats would have loved to be with you, if only there had b33n some around to hear your lovely meows :33
5794
:33 < me?
5794
:33 < well
5794
:33 < i have never told anybody this not even my moirail
5794
:33 < heh, actually hes the LAST guy i might tell, he so wouldnt appurrve X33
5794
:33 < but yes i have liked somebody for quite some time, but alas he doesnt know it
5794
:33 < hmmmmm
5794
:33 < ohhh no no no, im too shy even for that!
5794
:33 < and he is so adorably grumpy all the time, it probably wouldnt go over well
5794
:33 < its hard to explain, maybe cats think diffurntly, but trolls tend to be pretty cautious about expressing their f33lings when it comes to the flushed quadrant
5794
:33 < it is
5794
:33 < ummmmmmmm
5794
:33 < okay it has romantic applications but it is also something more general than that
5794
:33 < a quadrant is
5794
:33 < how do i say this!
5794
:33 < a quadrant is a thing in a group of things that consists of four similar things
5794
:33 < EXACTLY like paws!!! :DD
5794
:33 < i know, but its just not that simple. i could make someone else jealous i think, and what if he doesnt f33l the same way, and, urrgh, its so complickated
5794
:33 < maybe i just n33d to let go of the silly infatuation
5794
:33 < i think its never going to happen honestly
5794
:33 < oh?
5794
:33 < so, youre saying that maybe i will have to die to get to be with him?
5794
:33 < i hope thats not the case!
5794
:33 < but i guess you just have a different way of looking at things
5794
:33 < thank you for the advice jaspers!
