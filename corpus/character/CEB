ok, i am here.
oh, hi dave!
what is going on in here?
yeah, dave, don't go!
i think we should listen to what he has to say.
haha, dave you're hitting on terezi? really??
karkat, is terezi really your girlfriend?
what is so different about your romance?
what's a quadrant? how many do you have?
wow, okay!
who cares, jeeeeeeeez.
what does?
what!
no way. vriska's cool, i'll talk to her all i want!
well, yeah...
but terezi killed me in an alternate timeline, so that isn't too bad i guess.
plus, i am pretty sure that she is sorry about it.
wait...
are you saying that vriska is interested in me?
like, romantically?
oh man.
uh...
i'm not sure what to think about this.
dave, what do you think i should do?
well, like i said, i thought she was pretty cool...
kinda bossy! but also pretty friendly.
mcconaughey!!!!!!!!
um, wow, i don't know.
i mean, yeah, sure it would be fun to do something like that with her, i think.
but...
beyond that, it's a little confusing!
i don't think i have ever actually liked a girl before in that way, so i am not really sure what i am supposed to feel or do...
uh oh!
yeah, i dunno dave, i have talked to karkat a lot and i really don't think he has a thing for me.
uh...
er...
do...
you think that vriska is going to try to make out with me?
rose and jade?
so, uh...
you want us to like, date them?
i think he is right, i think we are all a little young to be thinking about that!
um, also,
we are kinda all related! sort of. through shared ghost slime genes. right?
so, uh...
wow, i have to marry rose?
uh...
wow.
why not?
