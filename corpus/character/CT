D --> Hi
D --> 100k
D --> What are you e%pecting to accomplish with this
D --> This is f001ishness upon one hundred thousand prior, equally unsolicited f001ishnesses
D --> You'll stop now
D --> I'm not
D --> I'm fine
D --> No I'm not
D --> No
D --> Yuck
D --> Don't pol100t my incoming data stream with his name, or any sort of e%cremental language you pick up from his ilk
D --> If you're 100king for a 100phole through which you may e%tract concessions from me, you'll have to 100k elsewhere
D --> Nepeta, what did I say about that awful language
D --> I won't stand for it, and you'll stop
D --> Your fraternization with the base classes have 100sened your morals, can't you see this
D --> Well, green b100d is ok, but it's not great
D --> But that's why you're lucky to have me to 100k out for you
D --> Because you don't know better, and you can't fight the role the mother had in store for you
D --> My bow and arrow are highly dignified symbols
D --> Archery is among the highest and most e%ceptional crafts, held in tremendous regard by the most a100f classes for centuries
D --> No
D --> No
D --> No I don't
D --> I think
D --> We need to stop talking about archery
D --> Yes
D --> We will stop talking about archery
D --> The topic is making me
D --> Sweat
D --> No, you're the one who e%ercises distasteful practices
D --> You e%terminate beautiful, innocent creatures by the hundreds
D --> I can't condone such wretched behavior
D --> Beasts are meant to be 100ked upon with adoration
D --> I guess that's basically acceptable in principle, but I still find it a bit unsavory
D --> No they're not
D --> You're wrong about me, Nepeta
D --> I do like to play games
D --> But they must be e%tremely important games with very high stakes
D --> Not the kind played by trans100cent green wigglers who let 100se an e%cremental surge hard in their wiggler-bottom diaperstubs
D --> As it happens I have arranged to play just such a game tonight
D --> Aradia and I have a private engagement to be co-leaders of the b100 team
D --> Absolutely not
D --> I forbid this
D --> You will take your position on the b100 team with me
D --> That's nonsense, you're nowhere even remotely within my pro%imity that would be necessary to e%ecute such a maneuver
D --> The thought of you fraternizing with and abetting those stink-b100ded h001igans strikes me as scandal beyond measure
D --> I'm afraid you're too delicate to withstand that sort of corruption
D --> It's forbidden
D --> Yes
D --> You won't
D --> You won't
D --> I am telling you not to
D --> And you will be on my team
D --> That's final
D --> Quiet
D --> No
D --> I do not
D --> And yet
D --> You will do as I say
D --> Yes we will
D --> You will join me on my team shortly
D --> Stand by for further instru%ion
D --> You're angry, and I appreciate that
D --> But it doesn't matter
D --> Di%ussion over
D --> Have I ever told you what a reprehensible disgrace you are
D --> I'm not in a very good mood
D --> There are a few things I'd like to get off my chest
D --> What you do appear to know is e%actly how to ma%imize my livid contempt for you
D --> With your revolting language and your sense of decorum
D --> At such breathtaking odds with the richness and perfe%ion of your b100d
D --> I just hate you so much
D --> And the degrees to which you pollute your precious b100d
D --> With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins
D --> Maddening
D --> You will stop
D --> No, you don't understand
D --> It's not a predi%ion, it's an order
D --> I command you to stop
D --> What
D --> Are you serious
D --> No
D --> This is una%eptable
D --> Ok, let's start over
D --> I apologize
D --> I was completely out of of line, and I'm sorry
D --> I have no right to talk to you like that, or tell you what you can't do
D --> It's not my place
D --> Your habits notwithstanding, I am lesser than you
D --> An inferior
D --> Don't you understand that you're better than me
D --> Can you please act like it
D --> That's not a command, it's just a polite request I guess
D --> 100k, it isn't that difficult
D --> Try to be cognizant of your desires and needs
D --> And attempt to regard those around you as simple vehicles meant to bring about your gratification
D --> What are you doing
D --> Right now
D --> It sounds as if you have begun playing with the red team
D --> Is this true
D --> Good
D --> This is very good
D --> It really pleases me to hear tales of physical subjugation
D --> I presume these were lesser beings, toiling in the lower ranks of some hierarchy
D --> Ok
D --> It pleases me considerably less to hear things like that
D --> But I've already stated I have no right to be disappointed by your conduct, so I will try to control myself
D --> Hmm
D --> Would it be too much to ask
D --> For you to maybe
D --> Boss me around a little
D --> If it would help to couch it in those terms
D --> Then yeah, I guess so
D --> But not the especially juvenile kind
D --> Let's keep it serious and professional
D --> Just
D --> Say anything
D --> As long as it's authoritative
D --> Hmm
D --> Decent
D --> I don't live near the ocean though, so it's hard to immerse myself in the scenario
D --> I do so many bad things
D --> Just awful things
D --> I'm incredibly impudent and a superior needs to put me in my place
D --> Yes
D --> Yes, that's good
D --> Like that
D --> E%cellent
D --> Now tell me this, highb100d
D --> I've been roughhousing a little too hard lately
D --> I've made a bit of a mess and anyone in a position of authority would surely be % about it
D --> Cross
D --> What do you make of it
D --> This wretched misbehavior
D --> Yes
D --> So good
D --> I am presently whipped into a state of contrition
D --> One befitting of our class disparity
D --> But I'm starting to perspire again so it's best that we stop
D --> Thank you for indulging me
D --> No
D --> But I comprehend the sentiment
D --> I have lots of thoughts, but they're difficult to communicate
D --> If you'll listen
D --> Honestly I'm confused by the social order
D --> See, that's what I mean
D --> How is it possible for one of your distin%ion to be so ignorant
D --> And loathesome
D --> Whereas
D --> A member of the most abject, verminous b100dline of all
D --> Can conduct herself with such grace and possess nothing but admirable mannerisms
D --> I find these striking ju%tapositions perple%ing, and I confess strangely into%icating
D --> I wonder if I have gone mad
D --> To form such a pact with her
D --> I shouldn't be talking about this
D --> You're the enemy
D --> What
D --> How many
D --> Good
D --> Use your cunning and venom to make them envy our nobility
D --> No
D --> Humorous insincerity is for pedantic wigglers
D --> That's because you're a little worse than me
D --> It's finished
D --> I'll deliver it shortly
D --> I'm happy to help
D --> But I don't understand why you're intent on gratifying that worthless peasant
D --> Fine
D --> Then let's proceed with the plan in a curt and professional manner
D --> Yes
D --> I guess it is pretty quaint
D --> That's the plan
D --> Yes, we're in absolute agreement
D --> Yes
D --> Yes
D --> Stop
D --> No, don't be absurd
D --> Are you
D --> Ok
D --> There are no %%ings up my sleeve
D --> Also, I don't have sleeves
D --> I am as transparent as can be, and my word is my bond
D --> You know
D --> I can feel you trying to read my mind
D --> Get out of my head, it's making me angry
D --> Try to remember who built your arm for you
D --> Aradia, here's the deal
D --> Now that the game has begun, the plan will be modified slightly
D --> We will not be co-leaders of the b100 team
D --> I alone will be the leader
D --> Is that understood
D --> Good
D --> Wait
D --> You have no objection
D --> Are you sure
D --> Do you typically embrace such a passive attitude when your superiors give you orders
D --> Hmm
D --> I think I should get a towel
D --> I'm perspiring heavily again
D --> Never mind
D --> I'm trying to stay professional about this
D --> Forget it
D --> It's just pleasant to consort with one of lesser breeding who clearly understands her place
D --> Perfect
D --> Then we are on the same page
D --> I 100k forward to seeing how well you serve me, server player
D --> What do you mean
D --> I don't understand
D --> Are you
D --> Are you saying
D --> That
D --> You are in a position of control over me
D --> Oh
D --> Oh my God
D --> This is
D --> Impropriety of a caliber I cannot even
D --> It's
D --> You are as low on the hemosprectrum as possible
D --> To consider that someone so low could be in a position of authority over me is
D --> It's just so
D --> Disgusting
D --> No it's
D --> FILTHY
D --> I need some air
D --> Or some cold milk
D --> Or a towel, I need a towel
D --> Where the fuck are all my fresh towels
D --> I mean
D --> Fiddlesticks, please pardon my language
D --> It won't happen again
D --> I'm fine
D --> I'll be fine
D --> I just need to breathe
D --> And to break something possibly 
D --> Yes
D --> It helps me rela%
D --> Do you
D --> Yes
D --> I just need a blasted towel
D --> Where ever did that Aurthour get off to
D --> Perhaps
D --> Whoa what
D --> Do you
D --> Want to break something
D --> I, uh
D --> Ok
D --> Yes
D --> Yes that was wonderful
D --> But could you please refrain from dipping into the vernacular of commoners
D --> In fact, this is an order from your leader
D --> Call things by their proper names
D --> Nevertheless, do it
D --> Now
D --> Could you please
D --> Uh
D --> Do that again
D --> Yes
D --> Yes
D --> Wait
D --> I don't know
D --> Maybe I don't want to order you to
D --> Maybe I want
D --> You to do whatever things that you want to do
D --> You could cause quite a bother for me, with the power you wield
D --> I can do nothing to stop you, peasant girl
D --> It's so magnificently depraved
D --> What was that
D --> Are you role playing now
D --> Stop, it's unbecoming
D --> You're better than that
D --> And by better, I mean worse
D --> Much, much worse
D --> Downright coarse and degenerate
D --> Just reprehensibly sordid
D --> Actually
D --> Yes
D --> You may role play and proceed to deepen this already irretrievable debauchery
D --> In fact I command it
D --> I command you to have free will and do as you please
D --> And continue being bothersome and unpredictably destructive
D --> I mean
D --> If you want
D --> Yes
D --> Ribbit again
D --> I will make haste through this mysterious realm and find your gate
D --> It will pose no challenge for me at all
D --> I will then give you your new body, and you may take your rightful place as my subordinate
D --> Actually
D --> Now I'm beginning to wonder
D --> Whether I want you to be my subordinate
D --> Hmm
D --> I hope this doesn't sound too strange
D --> Maybe I would like you to be the co-leader again
D --> In fact
D --> Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm entertaining this thought
D --> It feels just vile
D --> Try not to roll your eyes at me
D --> Would you mind terribly
D --> Being the leader
D --> But
D --> Don't tell anyone
D --> You will be the leader of me, and I will lead all else
D --> You would in effect be the secret leader
D --> Yes, that's the spirit
D --> You take to authority well for one of your b100d
D --> Not yet
D --> But soon your heart will beat anew, and through it, fresh b100d and fresh passion
D --> On my way
D --> I'm attempting to determine what it is that ranks humans in their class stru%ure
D --> I'd assumed the color of your b100d would serve as the basis for placement in the hierarchy, as would be e%pected and natural, but I was mistaken
D --> I was similarly in error believing the color of what you type corresponds with the color of your b100d
D --> Well, obviously
D --> I understand that now, I'm not a f001
D --> I see
D --> So, in other words, a sort of b100d letting ritual
D --> To assess whose pulse is steadiest and thus whose flow is the most STRONG
D --> Really
D --> So your social e%elons are dictated by the noble artform of the ancient slam poets
D --> Or the Earth equivalent
D --> I believe
D --> That this is probably nonsense
D --> I've already been hornswoggled repeatedly by your comrades, who I quite reasonably mistook for your superiors in b100dline
D --> Your race makes a habit of deception, and I will not tolerate it
D --> You will stop
D --> I command that all verbal misdire%ion and hoofbeastplay will cease during my communications, is that understood
D --> Did I say something entertaining
D --> I try to stay engaged with many aristocratic practices
D --> But I'm not much of a poet
D --> My poems are private
D --> If you're prepared to be particularly forceful about it
D --> I may be suitably disgusted to comply
D --> Yes
D --> Those are the sorts of assertive statements which could get me
D --> Flowing
D --> Just a thought. Let's mock a topic with less awfulness
D --> If you'd use the e%cuse to be less culturally myopic, what are your views on abuse to the walking apocrypha
D --> Would you choose if duly cued to put your bruising clop to a flock of naughty roboti%
D --> Perhaps it's that it's martial tacti% that matter for status. Unless you redact this
D --> I'd hazard in practice that it's a glass of what's lactic that would impact this
D --> Pragmatic to presume? A human metric for grandness stands on fondness in honest
D --> For wanton aplomb with strapping song smithing, ripping sonnets of STRONGNESS
D --> But perhaps
D --> To divine class divides in unclassified swine is butchering time
D --> Your fauna I find requires too little strength to savage in rhyme
D --> I fear inferiors have monopolized my highest priorities
D --> Let's eschew crude inferiors, pursue nude superiorities
D --> Review z001ogical peculiarities, great stalking enormities
D --> Fle%ing in unison, baying at moons within fraternal sororities
D --> Great musclebeasts tussle, bu%om in heft
D --> With thunderous muscle, buttock to spec
D --> Connect blows to discover, how invincible pecs are
D --> Venture low to uncover, his inimitable nectar
D --> Should song serve to placate one
D --> And fortune holds he lactate some
D --> STRONG hands tugging teat make great ambrosia collectors
D --> What do you mean
D --> Are you ordering me to conceal my poems again
D --> It 100ks to be a legendary weapon
D --> Giving up on the treasure so easily
D --> It strikes me as an artifact rooted in universal lore of nobility
D --> As valuable an asset as strength is
D --> And as much as anyone with his wits is fond of being STRONG
D --> Such weapons require finesse to operate
D --> And surely in this case, to retrieve without damaging
D --> Hence your no doubt frustrating restraint
D --> E%cessive force will shatter such weapons
D --> We both know this from e%perience
D --> The adult human who trained you
D --> And taught you the ways of being STRONG
D --> Remember
D --> Yes, and now, being learned in the ways of STRONGNESS
D --> You like myself are unfortunately limited in the weaponry you may wield
D --> Ironically the training which has ennobled you beyond others has made instruments of high b100d brittle in your hands
D --> Hence the state of your favored weapon, hobbling your specibus
D --> I know what this is like
D --> Oh
D --> No
D --> Bows
D --> Yes
D --> Sometimes
D --> What are you doing
D --> Careful
D --> About succumbing to these sorts of destructive
D --> Urges
D --> Addi%ion is a powerful thing
D --> I think
D --> I need
D --> Something to dry myself off with
D --> Yes
D --> I am still e%ceptionally STRONG
D --> Strength continues to be my STRONGEST attribute
D --> With what
D --> You mean
D --> The highb100d
D --> Oh dear
D --> Are you saying the highb100d has finally embraced his position atop the hierarchy
D --> Yes e%actly
D --> I certainly appreciate the debauchery inherent in receiving an order of such gravity from a rogue-b100ded foulmouth
D --> But
D --> I'm not entirely positive I can raise a hand to the highb100d
D --> It wouldn't be my place
D --> Uh
D --> No, I have a sufficient supply of drying utilities
D --> The b100d
D --> It is just so
D --> E%quisitely purple
D --> Yes
D --> But 100k
D --> The situation is very delicate I believe
D --> The highb100d would benefit from a proper enculturation into the aristocracy
D --> I'll take measures to ensure our comrades aren't injured
D --> Well
D --> If it comes to close quarters skirmish, I will try to be prepared
D --> Yes
D --> That's different
D --> He is a sea dweller
D --> Our feud is codified in tradition
D --> Neigh, we are obligated to be at odds
D --> It's dignified
D --> He is
D --> How many of us are rampaging murderously, e%actly
D --> Do I really have to
D --> I'd prefer not to interact with him
D --> It's primarily that his advances make me uncomfortable
D --> We are
D --> Oh shoot
D --> E%cuse my vulgarity
D --> I will 100k into it
