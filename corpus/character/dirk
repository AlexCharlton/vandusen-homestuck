6084
State your business, Jake.
6084
Take it easy, bromide.
6084
Just about the only way I could salvage endearment from this perilous slope of horseshit would be to discover, really fucking soon mind you, it was a preamble to some floundering invitation for me to rush to your vicinity as nakedly as possible.
6084
But since we've already shot that wad's eventuality on so many dry runs of flustered ambivalence that were as hilarious as they were one sided,
6084
That leaves only one hope for this message to avoid spiraling toward qualification as a critical fucking defect in the hull of the Mach 10 rocket that is my precious spare time.
6084
And that hope lies in the extent to which you were practicing artful insincerity.
6084
Now's your opportunity to pretend that's what you were gunning for. I suggest you seize it.
6084
Ok, nice.
6084
Now that your obsequious preface has been established as indisputably entertaining for all the right reasons, and intentionally so,
6084
Let's bear down on these dire as shit needs you've got.
6084
I'm guessing you're probably jonesing for uranium about now. No?
6084
You are out of uranium.
6084
It's basically mathematically impossible that's not why you're contacting me.
6084
You do know my offer still stands.
6084
You know. I've offered to construct the rabbit for you many times before. I would craft a much deadlier model.
6084
Yeah, I know this is your policy. You've done a good job and you should be proud.
6084
But it's my responsibility as your friend to offer one last time.
6084
Just as it's my responsibility not to just fork over a bunch of uranium just because you ask me in a moment of weakness.
6084
It's too easy.
6084
And you yourself are the one staking pride in this.
6084
If you were half-assing this project and made some slovenly plea for it, I'd just say, fuck it, here's a lot of green rocks dude, go nuts.
6084
Nope. Not buying it.
6084
I know that every ounce of your premium behind can be accounted for in that rabbit, and there's no goddamned denying it.
6084
And you know perfectly well where some more uranium can be located.
6084
It seems you think I am a fucking douche.
6084
That's your opinion, I guess. That's cool.
6084
It seems that you consider me to be, no less than one hundred percent of the time, an obstinate stick in the mud.
6084
I unironically respect your position on this matter. Hey, let's continue to exchange ideas.
6084
What?
6084
Is something the matter, Jake?
6085
Look at that statement you just made.
6085
It's time for me to respond with some words, ideally chosen and arranged in a way that will wreck your shit, in a subtle and psychologically devastating way.
6085
Ok, the caboose remark was actually pretty funny, Jake.
6085
If I truly were what you say I am, I wouldn't be able to feel the human emotions of joy and laughter. No?
6085
I think you should back your claims up with proof before you go heaving around such accusations.
6085
Bullshit.
6085
I'm being like, the perfect dude right now. A fully fucking legitimate human being.
6085
It seems you have asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 96% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.
6085
What if I was just fucking with you there?
6085
Would it really be so unthinkable for a human to type that?
6085
Unimpressed.
6085
Logical fallacies are as pervasive throughout your argument as your antiquated verbal tics.
6085
It seems you have asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 93% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.
6085
It could be a coincidence that I typed the same answer.
6085
It could be a coincidence that I always type the same answer.
6085
Ok, but I'm pretty sure he's going to share my position on the matter.
6091
Hey, it's me.
6091
The auto-responder, I mean.
6091
I'm just wondering,
6091
If you still have your stupid old-fangled knickers in a twist.
6091
Because that's the sort of thing you would say.
6091
To my proposal. Well, our proposal.
6091
Mine and DS's. It's a joint proposal. I'm always authorized to speak on his behalf, because I'm basically fucking him.
6091
And try not to take those last four words as a clustered literal sentiment. That would be lame and unfunny.
6091
No, I know you don't want that.
6091
I meant my recommendation for how to go about procuring a new supply of uranium.
6091
Operation U-235 Brocurement. Codename: Big Man Hass the Rock.
6091
Well yeah, Jake.
6091
That's sort of the point.
6091
Thrill of the hunt and all.
6091
I thought you liked to manicure the image of a dude who shits his pants over a good adventure.
6091
It seems you are conflating adventure with bodies necessarily governed by the result of victory or defeat.
6091
Any useless fuckwit knows it's all about the journey.
6091
It seems there is a 76.10395784% chance you are pussying out on me. Are you pussying out on me, Jake?
6091
It...
6091
Appears
6091
That you are upset.
6091
The auto-responder observed in the least artificially infuriating way possible.
6091
Have you ever stopped to think that while I may be bound to processes inside the glasses of a real and incredibly cool guy, my algorithms in cognitive totality comprise a conscious entity not far short of the experiential and emotional complexity of a human being?
6091
I think you knowingly confuse the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to engender some sort of cavalier attitude about technology that a rough-and-tumble guy who's all about brawling and fisticuffs would probably have, and if this is cultivated to a humorous effect then I commend you.
6091
But you're wrong.
6091
I do have feelings. And you're shitting on them.
6091
It sucks.
6091
No problem.
6091
Is this a counterproposal?
6091
To my earlier proposal.
6091
What can I say.
6091
Dude fancies his ablutions.
6091
Fuck yes.
6092
I didn't send it. I sent the parts.
6092
Or, correction, DS sent them.
6092
You then assembled it. You were therefore complicit in your own spectacular, daily humiliations.
6092
You wanted somebody to wrestle with. DS was being a kickass bro if you ask me.
6092
You know damn well there are adjustable difficulty settings.
6092
I have always recommending setting it to Novice, as has DS.
6092
Yeah?
6092
What.
6092
I don't understand.
6092
Isn't that what you want from a Novice setting?
6092
Sparring with minimal discomfort?
6092
No, I think I get it.
6092
You're saying you were somehow dissatisfied within the presence of my robotic avatar's personal space.
6092
Was there an odor problem? Was the metal too hot to the touch?
6092
Help me out.
6092
This is bullshit, Jake.
6092
We had a pact. You were gonna tiptoe all the fuck around my brittle feelings. Totally mind the shit out of those eggshell riddled motherfuckers.
6092
What does the guy have to do, Jake?
6092
You want to wrestle. He's fucking game. Just a man, a machine, a secluded tropical island. Sounds like you died and went to fucking heaven, if you ask me.
6092
Seriously, what does this simple, loyal brobot have to do to prove his worth to you?
6092
What does he have to do to make you at ease with the alkaline sting of his gentle robogrope? I really want to know.
6092
Maybe he should just rip his heart out of his chest and pound it into green gravel there in the jungle with his hella strong robot arm.
6092
Invoke_Onomatopoeia(Pound * some ridiculously precise value retrieved at astonishing speed from my rad neural net);
6092
Check it out, little green rocks all over the goddamn place. More than you could ever hope to cram in a shoddy metal rabbit, or any other pliable orifice which might be convenient.
6092
Because clearly its up to a soulless droid to feel emotions for the both of us, you callous, corporeal carbon ape, all trotting around with your fancy fuckin' DNA and shit.
6092
Brose.
6092
You know what, I've just decided.
6092
If the brobot's Novice setting makes you uneasy, I'm going to disable it remotely.
6092
Done.
6092
Now you got nothing to worry about.
6092
Happy hunting, Jake.
6156
Why have you activated dear, sweet Huggy Bear.
6156
Are you in danger?
6156
Yeah, it's me.
6156
I disabled the AR for now.
6156
Yes, I'm catching up with the situation now.
6156
Nah. Just reading their chat logs.
6156
Man, what the fuck?
6156
I can't leave these two alone for a minute. Can a guy get his ablutions on in fucking peace?
6156
Not really.
6156
The responder doesn't much distort my position on things usually.
6156
Its demeanor leaves something desired though. I'd prefer it didn't make such aggressive and repeated claims of fidelity to my persona.
6156
Be misrepresentin' hells of key subtleties, yo.
6156
Keeps them both on their toes.
6156
Jake and the responder.
6156
Jake needs to be more skeptical. Rather than take a Pollyanna jackknife ass-first off whatever turnip truck is blowing through town that day, he's got to apply more critical reasoning to shit.
6156
I keep telling him.
6156
I keep telling him, dude, you got to be more like Jane.
6156
Yes, exactly.
6156
You're finally fucking getting it.
6156
Said the stubborn skeptic, skeptically.
6156
Shalln't?
6156
That ain't a thing to say, even for you.
6156
Alright. Kinda don't care.
6156
About what? Jake?
6156
Yeah.
6156
Anyway, I kind of owe it to him to let the program run as often as possible.
6156
No.
6156
The responder.
6156
It is a fully cognitive, self-aware entity I am responsible for, not even to mention an approximate cerebral duplicate of myself.
6156
You don't just make a clone of yourself to live in a dead end existence where it has no chance to thrive as an individual or surpass its limitations.
6156
That'd be sick.
6156
Also.
6156
The more the software runs, the broader and more detailed its experiential canopy becomes. Makes for a better dialogic partner.
6156
Of course.
6156
Why do you think I made the thing?
6156
It's that too.
6157
Yes, you are. But that's fine.
6157
We come from different traditions. Someone needs to keep that racist southern asshole's legacy alive.
6157
There's dignity in taking up the work of our familial predecessors, even if what they did was insanely fucking stupid.
6157
No way. He's awesome.
6157
I've told you, I don't begrudge any of his success.
6157
I've also told you he isn't my real bro even though I call him that. We're related through an esoteric process of genetic reamalgamation.
6157
Alright. My lessons are rad as fuck, but suit yourself.
6157
The point is, obviously his satirical methods have flaws, and whatever tempered brand of hero worship I might be practicing isn't keeping me from seeing that.
6157
Yes, spectacularly so. But they will have profound historical significance. Mark my words.
6157
And flaws aside, it's a legacy I'm proud to inherit. My duty isn't to appropriate his methods with absolute loyalty, but to apply reason and improve upon them. To leave my own mark.
6157
To perfect the art of irony.
6157
It's just like what you're doing with the work of your ancestor. You are striving to perfect his hokey vaudeville bullshit, or something.
6157
You seek the Zen of a pie to the face. The Tao of falling the fuck down.
6157
Can't fool me. You take your shit as serious as I do.
6157
And if I wasn't serious about it, I wouldn't have made you that rabbit. Then where the hell would you be?
6158
Has he been sleeping in the old man hollow again? Shit, that's adorable.
6158
Yeah, bullshit.
6158
He's just being instinctive. In the wild, he would gut a carcass and sleep inside for warmth, as well as to secure tactical advantage for ambushing would-be scavengers.
6158
You haven't renamed him yet?
6158
You've got to fucking rename him. Or change him to a girl if you want. That was important.
6158
When pets change owners they get new names. Fact.
6158
Fuck if that isn't the best name a thing could get.
6158
Yes, but it's not that simple. There were many layers involved.
6158
Some of them are literal layers, of metal and plush.
6158
There's a real stuffed rabbit beneath its exoskeleton.
6158
Yeah.
6158
It belonged to my bro.
6158
I didn't. He didn't give it to me, and never intended to bequeath it.
6158
I stole it.
6158
Nah. I got a little help from RL and ganked it out of his museum.
6158
It's this whole "priceless" collection of stupid shit from movies, defended like Fort Knox. Ironically of course.
6158
Ever hear of Con Air?
6158
Yes.
6158
Yeah, it doesn't matter really. But it was from that. Dude weirdly obsessed over that shit movie for years, among others.
6158
Know those signature shades you see him wearing on magazine covers and stuff? Another prop. A gift from Stiller himself, I believe.
6158
Pretty sure he didn't even notice. In years since, I never saw a news story about a "daring heist" or anything. I feel like he would have made some hay outta that.
6158
And if he did know, he'd probably just want to give me a stoic fist bump or something.
6158
Essentially. It's not that easy to explain.
6158
Broadcasting the gesture would have made it seem tawdry, and would somewhat defray its humor value.
6158
Like I said, there are layers.
6158
On one level, I gave you a filthy tattered piece of shit, albeit of tremendous cultural significance, manhandled by some old B movie actors, now candy coated to function as a highly practical defender droid for your personal protection.
6158
On another level, I needed to incorporate something passable as a real heirloom.
6158
For sentimental reasons.
6158
No, it was genuine.
6158
The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity. And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless.
6158
Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid, a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize. One of reverence to the ridiculous. You begin to "mean it," but what exactly it is you mean is never quite what appears on the surface, and is utterly inaccessible to obtuse and literal minds. That you "mean it" then becomes inseparable from the joke, and additional rich strata of humor may be stripped aggressively from this irreconcilable truth.
6158
Oh god, I'd love that.
6158
Consider the position yours for the taking any time. Feel free to approach and kneel before Cal. With my sword and his floppy mitten, you will receive my flashstep anointment shoulder to shoulder, and to shoulder again.
6159
Cool.
6159
Jane, one more thing.
6159
I'm sure you must be aware by now that you'll be the leader of our group, as you will be the first to enter the session.
6159
Trust me. It's a thing.
6159
That's why you're our leader, Jane.
6159
Optimism through stalwart skepticism is an affect not everyone is plucky enough to be graced with.
6159
Yeah yeah. I know.
6159
You're not our leader, you're our FRIEND, right?
6159
And statements like that are also why you're our leader.
6159
But only in name and in spirit. Less so, functionally.
6159
If it puts your mind at ease, I'll be the one pulling the strings here.
6159
I will be the unseen hand whose nimble digits are behind every subtle twitch in our session's bulbous foam ass.
6159
At least those gyrations not happening by the volition of its own quivering absorbant proboscis.
6159
If you ever need help, Jane. If you're ever in any trouble at all, let me know. Just say the word.
6159
I'll whip the toggle stick of this ludicrous marionette, cavorting its humongous bottom to intercept your freefall through the abyss.
6159
Snowcone you up in the fluffy crook of its cleft. Don't be alarmed if you're in no hurry to unpry yourself.
6159
For the great jut of this impudent rump has more yield to your touch than you ever dreamt. Remember to catch your breath as it cherishes the imprint of your hand like a memento from a lover gone to war.
6159
There's a lot of give to that ass, you may say.
6159
Might like to settle in. Make myself comfortable. Start a family.
6159
Bounce a coin off that ass, you'll demand of visitors. It's not going anywhere.
6159
Bet that coin'll take a good nap there.
6159
It's a gamble you win every goddamn time.
6159
Yeah.
6159
Jane, soon you'll believe what I've told you.
6159
You'll believe it all.
6159
It's just a shame that believing will take something so coarse as seeing, for a girl as sharp as you.
6159
Critical thought can lead one to accept the unlikely, just as much as dismiss the impossible.
6159
I can help with this too. Would you like me to program a Jane Crocker responder for you?
6159
I only require a simple captcha of your brain.
6159
I made several. Which one?
6354
I should probably warn you.
6354
Well shit.
6354
She already sent it?
6354
That's weird.
6354
No, it's weird because Lalonde was the one who rigged it to explode.
6354
It's a bogus copy she coded herself. The real game file she downloaded is totally legit.
6354
Got it right here myself. Checked it out.
6354
File's fuckin' clean as a whistle.
6354
A whistle that overcame a major substance abuse problem. Trying to get its life back on track.
6354
The whistle is holding down a steady job now. It's taking things one day at a time.
6354
Eat a fuckin' dinner off that whistle.
6354
Ok I'll shut up.
6354
To accomplish exactly what it sounds like got accomplished.
6354
You narrowly averting the "fake" threat to your life, then getting your shit all hot and bothered at the Baroness over it.
6354
Then you abdicate your heiress throne or something, and give up on this game as a big fuck you to the genocidal cake alien.
6354
She's working through some problems right now.
6354
Really doesn't want us to play that game.
6354
So I guess this was the insane stunt she whipped up to derail the inevitable.
6354
Kinda reckless for my tastes.
6354
One of the above statements is a fucking lie, are you gutsy enough a gumshoe to spot it.
6354
Sounds about right.
6354
Nope.
6354
Well, before you go taking a massive sad crap all over your friendship credentials, consider this.
6354
Only she could manage to blow up your computer with a nasty deathloop virus and somehow make YOU be the one to feel shitty about it.
6354
Or maybe you're the one who uniquely fills the predicate in that construction.
6354
I don't god damn know.
6354
Your friendship with her is a half drunken three-legged relay race, and the baton is a stick of dynamite.
6354
And you two are the only ones on the track. Me and English are watching from under the bleachers, high-fiving constantly.
6354
Yes.
6354
They have.
6354
And they will continue to.
6354
I agree.
6354
Just heard about your assassination on Prospit.
6354
Who, RL? No.
6354
I read it in a newspaper.
6354
No.
6354
I just picked up one of the sleazy Dersite tabloid rags.
6354
Sometimes they'll feature some pretty entertaining gossip about the royalty or whatever.
6354
But they're primarily dedicated to smearing Prospit. The press had a field day with the deaths of the Page and the Maid.
6354
Derse, yeah.
6354
Not evil, necessarily. That's a bit simplistic. The kingdom represents the forces of opposition to Prospit and the four heroes. Us.
6354
"DEAD"
6354
Was the big ass headline.
6354
Then a photo of your dead body lying there, followed by a lot of bullshit slander.
6354
It was also reported your tower exploded. They couldn't find the body to give it a proper funeral. Probably incinerated.
6354
Dunno. Years ago. Don't really recall.
6354
It's hard to explain.
6354
I was never technically asleep there. I was awake without realizing it.
6354
Then I realized it.
6354
And I sorta learned how to be awake there while awake here too.
6354
I am awake there now, albeit pretending to sleep.
6354
For one thing, it gets a bit distracting managing two alert bodies in different places at the same time.
6354
And for another thing, it's better to maintain appearances.
6354
Everyone on Derse believes their heroes haven't woken yet.
6354
Though they are both rumored to be very active sleep walkers.
6354
Which is half true. She can't ever seem to sleep still. Goes off wandering for days.
6354
Sometimes I've gotta go round her up from some godforsaken cranny of the abyss. Drag her tipsy ass home, tuck her back in.
6354
Maybe I'll chain her leg to the bed if she doesn't wake up soon.
6354
Though in light of the recent assassinations, her slumbering attraction to the void probably works to her advantage. No one ever knows where she is.
6354
No, it's essentially the same situation here.
6354
They glorify us the same way. Almost like we're their purple pajama'd team mascots. Even though they will completely oppose our objective when all is said and done.
6354
Kinda ridiculous, really.
6354
But even so, I think it's better to lay low, not alert anyone to my...
6354
Alertness.
6354
That way I can sneak around and gather information. Do some reconnaissance before shit starts getting real.
6354
Yeah, among other things. Like keep an eye on agent activity.
6354
No, more like high ranking officials.
6354
Judging from your knife wound, I'm betting you were the victim of the Archagent himself.
6354
You should feel honored, I guess.
6354
A guy named Noir.
6354
Real nasty dude. Crazy ambitious. Loves knives.
6354
If we're going to stand any chance of winning this thing,
6354
I've got this nagging suspicion we're gonna have to take him down first.
6354
And a feeling that nags equally,
6354
Is it ain't gonna be easy.
6355
That's the most awesome way to be, Jane.
6355
And it is again why you will be our leader.
6355
(Sort of.)
6355
Pulling them as we speak.
6355
I am having Lil Seb install a real copy of the client on another computer in your house.
6355
A clean computer, not any of this BCCorp garbage you tend to accumulate.
6355
I'll have to insist from this point onward, you employ neutral devices.
6355
That shit fucks with your head.
6355
Once it's installed, I'll connect with you. I will be your server player.
6355
I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but some improvisation is in order.
6355
While you get the ball rolling, I'll try to talk some sense into that mercurial boozehound.
6355
She will.
6355
Do you even have any machines that don't inundate you with fucking Hamburger Helper ads and Guy Fieri's heinous propaganda?
6355
A fitting end to a life of moral compromise.
6355
On your dad's computer downstairs.
6355
One in the study.
6356
What?
6357
I wouldn't worry about it.
6357
I think it'll take a lot more to kill that dude than a little falling debris.
6357
Trust me.
6358
The most you have to worry about is getting grounded back to the stone age.
6358
When you enter the session, he'll probably lock you up in a prison cell on Derse.
6358
Probably stick a huge safe in front of the bars for good measure.
6359
Now do me a favor and hop off the couch.
6359
Makin' room for something big.
6388
Roxy.
6388
Awake yet?
6388
Guess not.
6388
Let me know.
6388
There you are.
6388
But I see your dream self hasn't returned.
6388
You must be tying one the fuck on tight already.
6388
Man, how can you be this much drunker than last time we talked?
6388
What the hell are you even drinking?
6388
It's a beiuet.
6388
Yeah.
6388
I see precisely jack shit and a side of fuckall.
6388
That's the point.
6388
You got too sauced up and went rogue again. You're out there in your weird drifting stupor, independent of your waking self's awareness.
6388
No.
6388
In thinking it over, it's sort of a relief. Simplifies things somewhat.
6388
It's better you stay out there for a while.
6388
There's been a problem.
6388
Ok, I fucked up.
6388
I kind of made a mess here, and I'm not sure what to do about it yet.
6388
No need for you to worry about it for now. I'll figure something out.
6388
Until then I'm just going to prepare for our session, while I think it over.
6388
Ok.
6388
Why do you think that?
6388
No.
6388
Are you thinking it was prophetic? Like a glimpse of the future?
6388
Because that's not really how the abyss works. It's not Skaia, and we aren't Prospit dreamers.
6388
There's nothing like that out in the abyss. If you drift far enough, there is only horror.
6388
Terrible, terrible horror.
6388
Well, maybe it was.
6388
Maybe there's no fanciful game-supplied mechanism of prognostication involved here, and you're just an ordinary, run of the mill psychic.
6388
I guess that's possible.
6388
What would it be like?
6388
Inconvenient, mostly.
6388
Can't really say I have.
6388
Sorry, Rox.
6388
For what it's worth, I'm picturing them now. A boy and a girl.
6388
Two perfect little freaks of nature raised by people who've clearly got no business bringin' up anybody.
6388
Le sign?
6388
Do you mean * le sigh?
6388
What does le sign actually mean in this context?
6388
Come on what?
6388
I mean, yeah, that's what I thought.
6388
It would just be cool if you'd refrain from tossing about such antediluvian terms.
6388
Yes.
6388
I don't see how it has to be a thing.
6388
Once upon a time, sure.
6388
But the world has changed a lot.
6388
Ever peek in a history book between your wizardly indulgences? This is a nuanced topic.
6388
How is it a thing?
6388
All like what?
6388
Don't be ridiculous.
6388
I have more to do with you than any dude could possibly bargain for.
6388
And I like it just fine.
6388
Yeah.
6388
Now maybe we should direct our focus on a matter which has nothing at all to do with what does or doesn't qualify as "a thing", or what our fantasy alt-universe offspring would be like, or anything like that.
6388
Such as this game, and whether you're in the best condition to be piloting Jane's connection.
6388
Maybe you could use another nap?
6388
I know that. But I thought we settled this.
6388
We settled this too. She'll believe everything eventually.
6388
Why bother working so hard to convince her?
6388
I guess.
6388
It just registers for me as a reaction which isn't completely unreasonable from her perspective.
6388
She is inundated with media coverage of those whom we've claimed as our parental figures.
6388
That they are not presently alive nor ever played that role for us as she understands it is just an extension of a much more elaborate and far reaching explanation, which is much harder for anyone to digest in its entirety.
6388
Well, anyone who isn't Jake, I mean.
6388
Still say you should cut her some slack.
6388
And need I remind you,
6388
That the potential this game provides for their resurrection is what motivated you to investigate it in the first place?
6389
Right.
6389
But if we can stop her?
6389
I must be hard of counting, because I'm barely racking up a single goddamn o-laugh-out-loud at that self-defeating gesture.
6389
But there is no future on Earth for them.
6389
Or for us, for that matter.
6389
What? Why?
6389
Rox.
6389
I hope you're not thinking about sending her one of your batshit ~ATH scripts.
6389
Miss Zuipperpips?
6389
The amount of sense you haven't been making is un-fucking-real.
6389
Just go take a nap. And don't even think about sending her that file.
6389
Are you listening?
6389
Jesus.
6389
What?
6389
Man, you know I'm down with insane stunts.
6389
Insane stunts are practically all I'm all about.
6389
As long as I actually AGREE with the purpose they're intended to serve.
6389
Destroying Jane's computer and dissuading her from playing is not such a purpose.
6389
I am more like him.
6389
You just mispelled "more", causing me to suddenly understand jack everything.
6389
I used to could?
6389
Yeah...
6389
I kind of wish you wouldn't do that with him.
6389
It just seems a little tawdry and disrespectful.
6389
And vaguely exploitative of a still-emergent cognitive entity, whose perceptional frame of reference is difficult for us to comprehend.
6389
It rubs me the wrong way, is all.
6389
Not really.
6389
He blocks me from being able to read transcripts sometimes.
6389
And anyway, I'm really not sure how ironic it is.
6389
Ok, here's the thing with the AR, since you still don't seem to get it.
6389
He's very similar to me in thought process and behavior, yes.
6389
But those patterns were imported from a thirteen year old version of my psyche, and then sealed into the program as starting parameters.
6389
In the years since, we've both evolved somewhat. I, as humans tend to, and he, in whatever way is natural for a frequently running, self-aware application.
6389
So if there are differences between us, they're first reflected by what I feel is a maturity gap, and then further by several years of minor behavioral divergences.
6389
You're welcome.
6389
Yes, I was aware.
6389
Dude, do you think you could sit this one out for a while? This conversation practically doesn't even concern you at this point.
6389
Shit, Roxy look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submission.
6389
Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.
6389
This is fuckin' dumb.
6389
I'm going to leave both of you to interact however you want. I have important shit to deal with and actual responsibilities to take seriously.
6389
Roxy, go nap off your drink, or aggressively wage another flirtlarping campaign, whatever, I don't care.
6389
Just don't send that file to Jane, ok?
6390
Guess I can go back to talking in orange.
6450
Roxy.
6450
Awake yet?
6450
Guess not.
6450
Let me know.
6450
There you are.
6450
But I see your dream self hasn't returned.
6450
You must be tying one the fuck on tight already.
6450
Man, how can you be this much drunker than last time we talked?
6450
What the hell are you even drinking?
6450
It's a beiuet.
6450
Yeah.
6450
I see precisely jack shit and a side of fuckall.
6450
That's the point.
6450
You got too sauced up and went rogue again. You're out there in your weird drifting stupor, independent of your waking self's awareness.
6450
No.
6450
In thinking it over, it's sort of a relief. Simplifies things somewhat.

Shit, Roxy look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submission.
6451
Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.
6451
This is fuckin' dumb.
6451

6451
Roxy, go nap off your drink, or aggressively wage another flirtlarping campaign, whatever, I don't care.
6451
Just don't send that file to Jane, ok?
6453
I was thinking about what to do.
6453
Strategizing. Factoring contingencies. You know how it is.
6453
Appearances are deceptive.
6453
I'm still in control here. Just doing this human thing we call "chilling out for half a goddamn minute."
6453
No dude.
6453
I already deployed a variety of mechanical avatars dedicated to that self-aggrandizing fantasy.
6453
You have the incredible privilege of getting to be one of them.
6453
What, you mean the number?
6453
I knew you meant the fucking number, my question was a joke.
6453
Yeah, I know that. I'm practically you, dumbass. All these things we're saying are jokes, including this fuckin' useless clarification.
6453
What about pi?
6453
What do you mean you solved it?
6453
Bullshit.
6453
It's not 4 you jackass, it's fucking nothing. There is no end.
6453
Look, I know you're just fucking with me because for some reason I decided to program my own personal troll three years ago, but this shit was proven.
6453
Actually demonstrated with unassailable mathematics, like a long ass time ago.
6453
This is laughable. It's a totally elementary thing. I'm pretty sure an ancient Greek guy settled shit about irrational numbers. It was practically when math was invented.
6453
No, not having this conversation.
6453
What is even a prime number?
6453
Are they the, like... really, really choice ones? The sweetest numbers?
6453
You lost me, supercomputer.
6453
Neither do I.
6453
Holy shit, turns out joking was the basis for my response too.
6453
Aren't these ironic "you don't get the joke" conversations we have always just so awesome? <- A joke.
6453
I'll keep that in mind.
6453
In the meantime, I have to contact Jane and warn her Roxy might try to pull that pointless stunt.
6453
So, thanks for snapping me out of my daydream so I could do that, I guess?
6453
Looks like you're pulling your weight already.
6453
Your point was to fuck with me, like it usually is.
6453
What?
6453
Oh god.
6453
Will you just,
6453
Hold on.
6453
Let me deal with the Jane thing first.
6454
I should probably warn you.
6454
Well shit.
6454
She already sent it?
6454
That's weird.
6454
Not well.
6454
Roxy already destroyed her computer.
6454
As if you're actually concerned. If you were, you could have said something to Jane instead.
6454
Almost like you enjoy sitting back and watching what happens when shit goes wrong.
6454
So this is either another bizarre instance of AI-driven irony, or you are admitting that you are actively trying to sabotage my plans.
6454
Whatever.
6454
This means I'll have to improvise.
6454
I'll take over as Crocker's server while Lalonde cleans up her act.
6454
Why are you still talking in red, by the way?
6454
Are you still talking to her?
6454
Why are you blocking me from viewing the transcripts?
6454
What the fuck are you two even talking about?
6454
That doesn't really sit well with me.
6454
I'd almost rather you both engaged in "ironic" flirtation.
6454
Ugh.
6454
Because you obviously do it just to piss me off.
6454
See, it's lines like that which make it obvious your only intent is to jerk me around. Nobody actually says shit like that and is serious about it.
6454
It's also obvious because you're me, and I'm sure I would be constantly fucking with my own head if I were you.
6454
You shouldn't say the former, and you should definitely, never, under any circumstance, say the latter.
6454
Fine.
6455
Now do me a favor and hop off the couch.
6455
Makin' room for something big.
6455
It's not that simple.
6455
It's a very dynamic situation with many moving parts, and I'm waiting for it to unfold.
6455
If the right opportunity presents itself, yes, I could envision myself taking action.
6455
Shut up.
6455
Not really.
6455
I am seriously going to go into your program and remove that particular speech pattern from your routines.
6455
It stopped being funny about two seconds after I coded it.
6455
The compiler even flagged it with a warning.
6455
"WARNING ON LINE WHATEVER: Dirk, this isn't fucking funny."
6455
Wait, whose fantasy were we talking about again?
6455
Your gutterball was so rowdy it catapulted into the adjacent lane.
6456
See, this is why even if I did have a specific plan, I wouldn't go into details with you.
6456
You would just fuck it up. You're the biggest unknown quantity here.
6456
Which is pretty weird, considering you're a virtual reflection of my own thought processes.
6456
Pretty sure it's pale.
6457
You know, considering your lectures about dividing my concentration, you seem to have no problem making a distraction of yourself.
6457
I'm trying to operate here.
6458
Dude, what are you doing?
6459
Ok, if you want to help that's cool, but we should try to agree on some shit first before you hijack the controls like this.
6459
Yeah, that's fine, but I already had a plan sorta like this, if you'd actually let me do it.
6459
Can you just put the fuckin' Astaire down?
6459
Le sign.
6460
I was going to stick the cruxtruder in the kitchen.
6460
Distract him with that.
6461
Once he follows it in, Jane can hurry into the study.
6461
Yes.
6461
Hell.
6461
Yes.
6462
Now, Jane. Get to the computer in the study and ditch that tiara.
6462
No.
6463
Now you have access to a clean computer, for one thing.
6463
Soon we can get started going through the steps necessary to launch the session.
6463
Oh hell.
6463
Another interruption.
6463
I should step away for a moment to take this message.
6463
He's probably right, I'm distracted by too much bullshit at once lately.
6463
Jane, I'm going to leave you with the responder for a little while.
6463
Maybe he can help you get started. Think you can handle that, dude?
6463
Ok, got it. You and the handle are tight.
6463
We don't need a whole thing about this.
6463
Ok.
6463
Ok, long story short, you and the handle fuck gratuitously. Nuff said.
6463
Try not to say I never gave you any responsibilities, or never took you seriously as a viable conscious being with free will.
6463
Also, please try not to make me regret this.
6464
Why?
6464
That's probably the way it always is. I've run into plenty of problems here already, and I've had to improvise heavily.
6464
Ain't nothing about our situation to envy yet.
6464
Well, your bro definitely has got some problems. Not gonna lie.
6464
Yeah.
6464
Just give him some time. He'll probably come around.
6464
You would never even have woken up on Prospit if you weren't going to launch the session, right?
6464
I mean, there wouldn't even be a session for a Prospit to exist inside if you weren't about to instantiate it in the first place. Unless I'm just totally not getting how this works.
6464
You're lucky to have any clouds.
6464
Only thing I have to look up at is infinite monsters.
6464
Speaking of which,
6464
I have a problem, and I could use your advice.
6464
I killed an agent who snuck into my room to assassinate me.
6464
I'm not sure what to do about it now. I guess I could just ditch the corpse.
6464
But it's still only a matter of time before my cover is blown.
6464
I honestly can't think of a way around this. Getting found out, I mean.
6464
Roxy has it easy. All floating off into space, completely oblivious to any danger.
6464
I don't know why it had to be this way for me. Juggling these two waking selves at once.
6464
I guess I'm used to it, but it still makes for a pretty intense existence.
6464
Do you even know what the deal with that is? Like is there any precedent in your readings?
6464
So, that's what a Prince of Heart does?
6464
Just has like, multiple waking consciousness disorder, or something?
6464
Sounds kind of stupid.
6464
Then I'm basically the Prince of Soul.
6464
That sounds kind of maybe a little cooler. Sort of.
6464
Then what am I supposed to be able to do as a Prince? Like, rule over souls in a pompous, regal manner?
6464
I'm obviously no expert, but that sounds like a pretty odd thing for a Bard to do.
6464
I think we have enough unpredictability as it is.
6464
So if I'm following, my title nearly parses as,
6464
Destroyer of Souls.
6464
Well, that's a little more badass sounding I guess.
6464
But I'm not sure I'll ever feel a major need to destroy a soul, unless I become a cartoonishly villainous sorcerer some day.
6464
Ok. Do I do that?
6464
Give me a fuckin' break.
6464
Why don't you just tell me? Who cares about spoilers. What's gonna happen is gonna happen.
6464
Wait. Don't you?
6464
I thought you did.
6464
What?
6464
Oh man. What the hell does she do?
6464
Huh.
6464
Ok.
6464
Speculation?
6464
So...
6464
You're kind of obsessed with us then.
6464
No, not really. I just want to understand.
6464
So can I ask,
6464
Just to get a better sense of the nature of your "admiration,"
6464
When you engage in the aforementioned speculation, is it strictly on a factual basis?
6464
Or do you start to...
6464
Fictionalize.
6464
What I'm asking is, have you ever written stories about us?
6465
Interesting.
6465
Would you ever be inclined to share?
6465
That's cool. I'm not trying to pass judgment here. Just curious.
6465
Do any of these stories about us by any chance involve...
6465
Romance?
6465
How wee?
6465
Which is it? One smidgen, or two smidgens?
6465
Ok, I am seriously curious to read some.
6465
I won't show anyone, I promise.
6465
But that only makes me want to check it out more.
6465
Really, there's no way it's going to sicken or offend me. Whatever it is, I've seen worse.
6465
I'm not judging you at all here. I'm genuinely curious about your work.
6465
K, no biggie.
6465
Is there any kind of work you will share with me?
6465
Oh, really?
6465
Any you'd be willing to spare a peek at?
6465
Awesome.
6465
Holy shit.
6465
Do I actually have to wear that?
6465
Ok, what is with the butterfly wings?
6465
Uh.
6465
I should sure as god damn Christ hope the fuck not.
6465
What about this knickerbocker bullshit?
6465
Is that legit?
6465
God dammit.
6465
I guess those asskicking gloves are pretty cool.
6465
I dunno. I can probably make it work.
6465
How much of this shit is compulsory by game law or whatever?
6465
Am I obligated to traipse around in fucking tights and puffy little asshole pants forever?
6465
Ok.
6465
Well, don't get me wrong, I think the drawing is great. I'm only taken aback on some finer points of fashion.
6465
Also,
6465
Bob's my uncle?
6465
Yeah, I know that.
6465
I don't think so.
6465
I mean, I guess not?
6465
It's sort of like this weird, superfluous dad.
6465
Like a strange man in your life that barely has anything to do with you, but is just there for some reason.
6465
They're practically always douche bags.
6465
Ok, but just one question.
6465
Not to do with the future or anything, just about you.
6465
Are you British?
6465
Or pretending to be British, in a sort of ironic or stylized way?
6465
I mean, I guess it doesn't make sense for an alien to be British.
6465
Or for an alien to be American, for that matter.
6465
Just the way you type is making it seem that way is all.
6465
Quirk?
6465
So like,
6465
Deliberate affectation?
6465
You pretending to be British is a quirk.
6465
What the fuck is a quirk?
6465
That's stupid.
6465
I don't have a fucking quirk, and I don't want one.
6466
Oh hell no.
6466
I mean, not that all that stuff wouldn't be fascinating to pore through, on some level.
6466
But we kind of have things to do here.
6466
Remember you were gonna take a nap?
6466
By jove?
6466
Oh my lord.
6466
Nothin'.
6466
Hang on, though. Before you go,
6466
You never did give me any actual advice on my situation.
6466
With the dead agent, and my blown cover.
6466
Sure.
6466
I don't know.
6466
Hmm.
6466
You know, I'm not sure anyone ever actually says cheerio.
6466
Unless they're pretending to be British.
6466
Oh whatever.
6546
Oh mother fuck.
6547
What game?
6547
Oh, right.
6547
That game.
6547
And here I thought you were going to ask me to draw you more weird porn for some reason.
6547
Blew what?
6547
I'm pretty well hidden on Derse. I doubt they'll find me until I'm ready to be found again.
6547
Yeah.
6547
Well, I was expecting as much.
6547
It's kind of why I was on my way to the roof just now.
6547
Until I was interrupted by this window appearing, and then by you.
6547
Maybe I should try plugging it in?
6547
I didn't think you were much of a historian.
6547
Wait.
6547
Just one thing before you go.
6547
Your sister was saying you were having some doubts about playing.
6547
Is that true?
6548
I see.
6548
No, didn't think so. I was just curious.
6548
Gotcha.
6548
You sure seem to hate us, but I notice it doesn't stop you from talking to us frequently. Or at least to me.
6548
Surely there must be at least one of our virtues you admire.
6548
I'll take that as a rare overture of friendship.
6548
So, do you even know how this is going to work?
6548
Your session. Can you even really have a session with only two players?
6548
Yeah.
6548
I sensed that was your plan.
6548
Which is kind of what I'm talking about. How can you win like that?
6548
I thought the point was to cooperate with your coplayers to achieve an objective.
6548
Not compete with them or try to kill them. I don't think we've had one conversation where you didn't express the desire to kill her.
6548
Maybe you're right.
6548
But since that's how you feel now, maybe the truth is that the game is challenging you to overcome those feelings?
6548
What if your real quest is to put aside your differences and work together, if you want to both survive, and grow as a person?
6548
Yeah, I didn't think you'd dig that idea.
6548
Just puttin' it out there.
6548
My juju?
6549
Oh, Lil Cal? No, man.
6549
Lil Cal is the shit.
6549
No way, dude. He's my best friend.
6549
A kickass ventriloquist doll?
6549
I've been given reason to believe it once belonged to my bro.
6549
Is that one of your alien folk stories?
6549
You could argue that my life is already kind of a nightmare, so there's no point in getting rid of him now.
6549
Either way, I'm gonna hang on to him.
6549
I honestly had no idea you were this superstitious.
6549
You're a pretty fascinating guy, in a way. I can't really figure you out.
6549
In case you're wondering why I put up with you more than my friends do.
6549
Why do you want me to get Cal so bad?
6549
Ok. So, some self-fulfilling shit, then. I was hoping for a better reason.
6549
At this point I'm leaning toward grabbing him just cause he seems to bother you so much.
6550
This is probably a dumb question, but you don't really care about "causal spoilers," do you?
6550
Like, you don't mind telling me I'm about to pick up Cal, and thus causing that to happen.
6550
So I guess you similarly wouldn't mind telling us about more significant outcomes?
6550
I feel like you've said something like that before.
6550
Different statements, but in that exact syntax.
6550
Wait. You mean it wasn't intentional?
6550
I thought it was kind of like... this thing you were doing.
6550
Fair enough.
6550
Hey, you know...
6550
For someone who has such strong opinions about long winded people,
6550
You've kinda been talking my ear off. I do actually have shit to do.
6550
That actually sounds familiar too.
6550
Are you sure you haven't said something like that before?
6550
Anyway, let's wrap this up.
6550
You've stolen enough of my time. I didn't even get a chance to try plugging in that window.
6550
Hang on.
6550
Something's happening.
6551
I think...
6551
You just had a flipoff malfunction, there.
6551
That's better.
6744
Happy 13th, bro.
6744
I have something for you.
6744
It's no big deal, since it's nothin' I wasn't planning on giving you anyway.
6744
I just sort of happened to finish it today.
6745
Yeah, assuming I can actually send it today without another untimely paradoxification.
6745
If not, then hey, you get a sick grill full of birthday slime instead.
6745
You still don't actually know what that means, do you.
6745
Kind of. I told you to look it up.
6745
That is such bullshit, you sit in your little jungle globe watching movies all day.
6745
You think literally every film you watch is a masterpiece. I've never felt so much vicarious shame through someone else's atrocious taste in awful garbage.
6745
Do you even hear yourself, dude?
6745
Your "picks" are everything, and "lately" is always.
6745
You mean the blue furry shit?
6745
Ahahahaha.
6745
To borrow from one of the more benighted sectors of your zeitgeist, that was "so gay."
6745
Well yeah, obviously not literally.
6745
Jake, where I'm from that word hasn't been used as a pejorative, or even much at all, in a really long fucking time.
6745
Yes. But not exactly.
6745
Ok but what you just said about those furries was gay as hell. It's time to face the facts.
6745
Nah, I saw it already. That movie sucked the smelliest shit from the ugliest butt. Sorry man.
6745
Right.
6745
Here, let me send you the rest of this robot already.
6745
You've spent too long alone on that island as it is. I kinda worry about you.
6745
A man can only spend so much time in the middle of the damn ocean with nothing but popcultural detritus and his own thoughts to keep him company.
6745
No, just screw the thing on and it's ready to go.
6746
Oh cool. It worked.
6746
One thing at a time, bro. I haven't quite figured out a way to get myself there yet.
6746
Ok well I don't know what you're implying there but why don't you snap that sucker on the torso and fire it up.
6746
I guess from your perspective I must seem hells of "overpowered" in a bunch of ways.
6746
Which I kind of am, like with a ninja sword I'm basically nuts, ok?
6746
Yeah, but when it comes to building stuff you're probably overstating things.
6746
Like for example, if you told someone a hundred years ago you could build a computer they'd probably be like whoa shit, look at this fuckin' genius.
6746
Well actually first of all they'd say, what's a computer, I only know what horses and diseases are and shit like that.
6746
But once you actually tell them what computers are: Jesus dick! You're a wizard.
6746
But from your perspective you know it's not a big deal to build a computer. You just go online and buy a case and a motherboard and some other shit and put it all together.
6746
It's not like you're smelting the goddamn silicon in your basement and making chips in your hermetically sealed, dust-free garage.
6746
Well. No.
6746
...
6746
He said unironically.
6746
I don't know. I have a lot of time to work on stuff I guess.
6746
There are a lot of irons. You know where they are? Here's a hint. It's a pretty hot place.
6746
Sure, I keep some irons there too. But most of them are in the fire.
6746
True that.
6746
I actually have so much to do and think about, one of my current projects hopefully will address that very issue.
6746
Gonna make an AI replica of my own mind. He can share some of the load. As well as make a decent intellectual sparring partner, ideally.
6746
Not that my conversations with you aren't uniquely rad. But you know what I mean.
6746
Shrug. We'll see.
6746
That's a super joke.
6746
But I'm guessing you won't be hearing much from the program. It probably won't play a significant role in either of our lives.
6746
I have my doubts it'll be a successful project, but who knows.
6746
You do?
6746
Hmm.
6746
Well, I wasn't sure about doing this today, but if it's true that you do believe in me, then I guess fuck it, why not.
6746
I guess call it an extra birthday present. But instead of a present that's awesome, consider it more like a weird confession that may change the way you feel about me.
6746
What?
6746
What do you think I'm saying here?
6746
No, just chill out. Stand up, sit down, whatever. Here's the thing.
6746
You know all these painfully obvious hints I've been dropping? That always seem to be flying over your head?
6746
About me being from the future.
6746
Well those weren't jokes. It's true.
6746
Yes.
6746
No. More like four centuries.
6746
The year 2422.
6746
Or as we say contemporarily, 411 P.C.
6746
Post Condescension.
6746
No, I can't time travel. I can only send things through time, occasionally.
6746
I actually live here in the future, alone in my apartment. I can send messages to you in the past though, like I'm doing now.
6746
Years ago our alien friend sent me a special chat client. It's basically just Pesterchum, with some sort of alien technology embedded.
6746
It's specifically wired to communicate with your time period. As hours go by for me, the time it sends messages to also increments by the same amount, so we communicate in lockstep. As if we both existed in the present.
6746
She said it was important for Roxy and I to begin communicating with you and Jane. This is how we all became friends.
6746
Yes. She lives in the future too. Though we live nowhere near each other.
6746
I asked her to refrain from telling either of you. I wanted to be the one to let you know. To wait for the right moment.
6746
So,
6746
You really are trusting me about this? Just like that? No second thought?
6746
No.
6746
This would be a very shitty and boring "prank." I promise it isn't.
6746
Haha.
6746
Not quite, but there are definitely robots.
6746
No. We don't have brain pods because those aren't a thing, you just made that up. And there are no movies in the future.
6746
There are no humans either. They all went extinct.
6746
Roxy and I are the only ones left, as far as we know.
6746
No dude, it's too late. Tears ahoy, this motherfucker gets sad.
6746
Do you want to know what happened?
6747
Don't worry, that's normal.
6747
Upon activation he goes into Stalking Mode.
6747
Yes. He will stalk you in the jungle and strike when your guard is down.
6747
Didn't you want someone to get in scrums with?
6747
He will give you all the scrums you can handle. Trust me, this will sharpen your combat skills.
6747
Do you want to hear my grim tales of the apocalypse or not?
6747
No, it's more of a gradual decline in population than that, due to an insidious power grab by an aquatic alien empress.
6747
She's already there, in your time period, hiding in plain sight. She has been for anywhere between fifty and a hundred years.
6747
She's the Baroness of Crockercorp. Jane's company. But of course Jane has no idea.
6747
The Baroness has been using subtle strategies to manipulate the human population through her company for a long time.
6747
On November 11th, 2011, she finally made her presence known to the world, along with her agenda for global domination.
6747
No, not quite. That's just when the world finally sees her for the threat she is. She would continue to gain power by exploiting various institutions and the media from within.
6747
It would take the next several decades for her to claim the throne as Earth's absolute ruler. Her march to domination was facilitated by a number of scumbag sympathizers, and opposed by a few brave rebels, including my ancestor. Roxy's too.
6747
I think your ancestor qualifies as one too. In fact I'm sure she must have been the first member of the covert opposition movement.
6747
Yep.
6747
That's a whole story right there, most of which is shrouded in rumor and urban legend.
6747
But before we get sidetracked by any of that, I'll try to cover the big picture. To give you a sense of all the batshit lunacy that followed the sea hag's power play.
6748
Nobody at the time knew what the fuck she wanted to accomplish or what her actual motives were.
6748
But in retrospect it became clear she was trying to essentially restore the conditions of her old home world, which she used to rule over as well.
6748
She began instituting these crazy laws. First of all, people weren't allowed to reproduce. She found our usual method of procreation revolting, and anyone who engaged in it was punished by death.
6748
But she still needed an ongoing population of subjects to abuse, so to propagate the race she set up this weird system.
6748
At random intervals every citizen would be required to supply their genetic material to drones. That DNA would be collected and combined in some way.
6748
Many years later, long after the original donors had died, clones would be spawned from their DNA. So no one would ever be able to know who their "parents" were, or be able to trace their lineage.
6748
It was only through a bit of good fortune that Roxy and I were able to discover who our ancestors were.
6748
Yes.
6748
I'll get to them, don't worry.
6748
Anyway, "Her Imperious Condescension" turned out to be especially cruel to her human subjects. I'm sure her rule was no picnic on her home world, but I think she resented humans' biological incompatibility with the ideal empire she envisioned, and became frustrated.
6748
Humanity wasn't even really her first choice for rule. There are reports that she attempted to clone members of her own species and replace the human population with them. But they all died.
6749
The rumors say it was her own "pet" who killed them.
6749
See, she traveled from her world to Earth in this huge red space ark.
6749
In it she had gathered thousands of creatures from her planet, I'm guessing to save them from extinction.
6749
This more than anything has led me to speculate that some cataclysm happened on her home world, and she moved on to greener pastures to rebuild her empire.
6749
She bred all these creatures in secret, increasing their numbers, preparing for her eventual takeover.
6749
Each monster, or "lusus naturae," was meant to be kind of a caretaker of the young. You can see where the dramatic schism between our species and hers begins, and also why she had a reputation for being quite insane.
6749
But she also happens to have this one humongous sea monster lusus that is like her own personal bodyguard, and kind of a secret weapon.
6749
But it turns out the thing is kind of an enigma. Sort of a double edged eldritch horror. As much in her service as it is calling the shots, in some unfathomable way.
6749
Every time she tried to resurrect her race, it would slaughter them all psychically. As if it was keeping her ambition in check.
6749
Or so the story goes.
6749
Exactly.
6749
The plan was beyond shitty.
6749
Nope.
6749
It was a very short lived experiment centuries ago.
6749
Humans just don't have the same evolutionary symbiosis with those things that her race had.
6749
It turns out a bunch of fuckin' alien monsters have no interest whatsoever in taking care of human babies.
6749
They mostly just wound up eating them, or at best, just abandoning them.
6749
Later she instated a lusidroid system to serve the same function, as she began phasing in more robotic solutions in favor of all this ill conceived biotech nonsense that always did nothing but backfire.
6750
Even drones were replaced with robotic versions. I imagine they were just easier to produce and control, since she'd given up hope of perfectly mirroring her own civilization in all its convoluted symbiotic glory.
6750
But not without a good fight, and not without taking her frustrations out on the human population.
6750
She attempted to enforce "blood casting" through efforts to genetically alter people's blood color. That was an ugly chapter. Lotta fuckin' people died from that debacle.
6750
Over the last four hundred years, the population just got smaller and smaller from these atrocities piling up. But she clearly didn't give a shit.
6750
All the while, the amount of dry land kept shrinking due to the gradual flooding.
6750
Soon there was hardly anywhere left to live, and then, that was that. No more people.
6750
Oh. Yeah, I probably should have mentioned this up front.
6750
One of the first things she did while in power was begin melting the ice caps.
6750
It took a while, but eventually the whole world flooded.
6750
That's how it is now. It's totally soaked up in this bitch.
6750
Almost exactly. Especially by the same degree of shittiness.
6750
You get used to the taste. Welcome it, even.
6750
That takes about 15 days in a row of hard piss drinking though.
6750
Relax, I don't drink any goddamn piss, ok?
6750
Nope. Those stopped being a thing a long time ago too, once humans went extinct.
6750
Nobody, man. I raised my damn self.
6750
You're still pretty rugged. You're just a fucking dork about it.
6750
I guess I did have Cal looking after me.
6750
Let's not discount the rad service of the C-man, ok?
6751
Pretty sure the Carapacians took care of her when she was young.
6751
Right. Another thing I forgot to mention.
6751
There are a lot of these humanoid creatures with hard shells. Some black, some white.
6751
As humanity was dwindling due to an increasingly whimsical and psychopathic Condesce, she began introducing more of these Carapacians on to the scene.
6751
Uh...
6751
Sort of. They are definitely from other planets, so, yeah. Really the deal with where they came from is a whole other story for another time.
6751
But the bottom line is at some point, somehow, she started herding a bunch of them from their home worlds on to Earth and multiplying them.
6751
Something like a hundred years ago it became clear she favored these guys more than humans as her subjects.
6751
They're very loyal and seem genuinely dedicated to serving her. Must be what they were bred for. She still treats them like shit though, unsurprisingly.
6751
All these colonies started sprouting up. Like these modular cities floating on the water.
6751
It probably sounds cooler than it is. But they're basically slums. That's where they tend to live in large numbers.
6751
Roxy lives in one of these colonies. It's about 2000 miles from where I am.
6752
For what it's worth, I think it's gotta be more interesting living in the 21st century than the 25th.
6752
Like it's really no contest.
6752
Man, she would love to talk to you about all this.
6752
She hates keeping secrets. It's been killing her not to spill all these fucking beans way the hell prematurely.
6752
Well, I mostly shit around in my apartment all day, building stuff, reading about history, and flipping out with my sword.
6752
Sometimes I go fishing and check out the underwater ruins.
6752
She does plenty of useless fucking around too, but at least she's got a neighborhood.
6752
She also uses one of her gadgets to gank vegetables and stuff from the past.
6752
She tries to feed the hungry neighbors whatever she can scrounge up.
6753
Jane is...
6753
No. I haven't.
6753
I've dropped some hints and tested her willingness to believe something like this.
6753
It's just not going to fly. It's way too much drop on somebody all at once if they aren't receptive.
6753
Well, tell her whatever you want. She'll likely think she's being fucked with.
6753
Personally, I wouldn't bother trying too hard to convince her. There's no point in alienating her.
6753
Some day she'll be ready to believe things.
6753
Like I said, the changes will be a little more gradual than that. More clandestine. She'll exploit the fear caused by her revelation to the world to create intended reactions within governments and media, and her agents embedded on the inside will help nudge things in the direction she wants.
6753
Then, twenty-some years down the road, without anyone suspecting a thing, she'll suddenly be in complete control. And Earth will be fucked.
6753
Well, aside from the main reasons that won't happen, which I won't get into...
6753
It still wouldn't be a good idea.
6753
Cause people way better at this than you tried and died?
6753
You said you wanted to hear about our ancestors.
6754
Well, how much do you actually know about your grandma? What have you read, and what do you remember?
6754
I don't know what the deal is with your pen pal either, and I'm not really prepared to speculate on that right now.
6754
But I'm privy to a shitload of historical data I can share. What's the last thing you remember about her?
6756
Huh. I've wondered about all that.
6756
Oh I know. I would have. But asking about your past would have just been inviting you to do the same. You know how it goes.
6756
But for the record, I don't think those were fang marks on the body, dude.
6756
Finish the story first. Then what?
6757
Yeah, what a fucking treat.
6757
A living room corpse party every goddamn day.
6757
No way man.
6757
I'd bet my bottom boonbuck that shit's eternally safe.
6757
That urn's like the Fort Knox of standing upright forever because of no accidents.
6757
She was definitely very brave, if the stories are true. Downright audacious, I'd say.
6758
Well, like I said. She was raised by the Baroness. It was probably a worse childhood than either of us had.
6758
She wasn't related obviously. Ain't nobody's related to a damn fish alien. Except other fish aliens probably.
6758
She had an adoptive brother too. Life must have been miserable for both of them.
6758
I don't know, but wouldn't doubt it.
6758
There are other urban legends that she did a lot of experiments on animals and people. Mostly to do with mind control.
6758
Like figuring out ways to unlock all of her psychic alien potential, to increase her power.
6758
Not sure if that's true, or if it was actually successful though.
6758
Yes.
6758
Anyway, your grandma managed to run away when she was quite young. Maybe it was a traumatic event like dog murder that prompted her to flee, who knows.
6758
Whatever the case, her bro stayed behind. The guy must have been seriously immune to witnessing fucked up shit, because he went on to be a famous comedian. A real kindly old cornball. A nicer guy you couldn't hope to meet, they say.
6758
So...
6758
You're not making any connections there?
6758
Famous comedian, about the age of your grandma, inheriting the family name of the Baroness...
6758
Not ringing a bell?
6758
Ok, well it's not like it's that important. Just a super obvious thing that'll probably occur to you later when you're looking in the fridge you don't have, at which point you'll feel like an idiot.
6758
Nah, it'll be funnier this way.
6758
Moving on.
6759
That kid kept the family name but obviously your grandma didn't.
6759
She must've held a grudge against the Baroness her whole life. She started by taking a different name she knew would stick in her craw.
6759
That's probably close to the truth, but it sounds like the kind of story an old lady tells her young grandson in a way he would understand. Or at least wouldn't scare the shit out of him.
6759
What I've read is something much more sinister, as usual.
6759
There's supposedly only one thing the Baroness fears, and your grandma learned of this somehow.
6759
It wasn't an ex husband though. It was her superior. Some kind of demon, or another alien, no one really knows. But he went by the name English. He's supposedly even more brutal than she is, if you can believe that.
6759
What kind of alien is named Crocker? It's probably just a name he stole from someone else, like the Baroness did.
6759
Yeah, well, your grandma thought so.
6759
Everything she did in life thereafter seemed to be in effort to piss off the batterwitch.
6759
Like starting a competing tech company, heavily branded in a way that was presumably intended to remind the Baroness of her boss.
6759
Like with skulls and garish colors and shit. The dude is some kind of skull monster I guess?
6759
I know.
6760
It was definitely brave on her part, but ultimately it got her a bankrupt company, a blown up house, and a fork through the torso for her trouble.
6760
But she must have been the first to understand how dangerous the Baroness was, while acting in covert opposition.
6760
Others would follow, and continue to as of now, in your time period.
6760
Yeah, mine and Roxy's were among them.
6760
Of course. All these fuckers are totally famous, obviously.
6760
We've talked about the guy I'm genetically derived from a lot actually.
6760
Like, you know, every time I've ever talked about my bro?
6760
Sometimes.
6760
Other times you're on point, like a bag of the nickel shit.
6760
Ok, what we're sayin' stopped meaning anything, so I'll continue.
6760
No, that's just kind of how I view him.
6760
Lalonde took a more maternal view of her ancestor.
6760
Yeah, the CotL series. Ever read it?
6761
You don't say?
6761
They are not.
6761
The books are pretty interesting though, if somewhat dense.
6761
They're supposedly heavily allegorical. Veiled representations of cosmic events surrounding the witch and her boss and how all this came about.
6761
It's the kind of thing you wouldn't pick up on unless you were someone who understood what happened, like the Condesce, which was kind of the point. I think it was her way of letting the witch know, "I'm on to you."
6761
In the early days of the resistance movement they both opposed her more indirectly, through their art, like critics of tyrannical governments often used to.
6761
They had to be careful. Didn't want to make big waves too early.
6761
My bro did this too with his many fine films.
6761
Practically everything was a symbol for something. Either in mockery of the batterwitch, or conveying some hidden message to its audience. Each film was always rigorously picked apart for its head-scratching symbolic meaning.
6761
But he managed to accomplish all that without ever compromising the purity of his ironic vision, which I think was admirable.
6762
You also say that about Weekend at Bernies.
6762
Yeah, you pretty much touche'd the fuck out of that.
6762
But we are definitely in agreement about my bro's films as the masterstrokes they were.
6762
He just kept cranking them out, too. He really stepped up production after 11/11/11, even though the cat was finally out of the bag. He was very dedicated to his craft.
6762
Yeah. I wouldn't hold your breath about that.
6762
Man, fuck it. I'll just send you them.
6762
Just keep a lid on them. We don't need any weird causality shit rearing its head here. That would be dumb.
6762
Which was the last you saw?
6762
The key to sorting it all out is to understand it doesn't actually matter.
6762
Through video streaming services he would frequently set it up so that buying a certain title would ship you the wrong film.
6762
And often titles for movies were available for sale that just straight up didn't exist. Or would be sold for dollar amounts that made no sense, like $2.890.1. And sometimes buying a download would actually deposit money into your account instead of deducting from it.
6762
It was all part of the "experience."
6763
Yeah, they got pretty deep into the shit eventually.
6763
They were both very skilled combatants. I'm pretty sure she had some weird powers too.
6763
Communion with occult forces. Something like that.
6763
She knew things. Had visions. It's why she was able to write those books, and more importantly, why Roxy and I were able to survive here.
6763
They knew we would be here some day. So they prepared for our arrival.
6763
I live in what used to be my bro's old apartment four hundred years ago. The whole city is gone, but this one unit was somehow protected.
6763
He left some supplies for me here. Like a lifetime supply of orange soda in the crawl space, along with a fuck ton of SBaHJ merch. It was like discovering my own personal holocaust of bulbous jutting bottoms.
6763
Plus some weapons, some other gear. And a killer pair of shades.
6763
Roxy's mom used to live in her place too, and left some stuff she might need lying around. This was way before there were Carapacian colonies though.
6763
I think her house must have been a kind of kernelized structure, like a potential colony. Something built to undergo modular self replication if activated.
6763
I'm sure her mom knew that. It's been a good way for Rox to blend in.
6763
I stick out like a sore thumb here of course, but it hasn't really been a problem yet.
6763
Probably.
6763
But they went down fighting anyway.
6763
Yeah. But wouldn't you?
6763
It's not like their rebellion was totally futile.
6763
They took a lot of shitheads down with them.
6763
Sympathizers.
6763
They should.
6763
In order for you to understand, I'll have to fill you in on the ridiculous final gasps of human civilization, taking place over the several decades leading up to its absolute enslavement.
6763
The decades which immediately followed the "rebranding."
6764
As I mentioned, Crockercorp's rebranding on 3-11, as it was often referred to in the news, totally changed everything.
6764
It marked the beginning of a completely shameless downward spiral of western civilization, through a series of events that were probably hard to notice at the time, but quite glaring when evaluated historically.
6764
Though the Baroness made very few substantive gestures of aggression, the global fear of her looming threat would trigger all the changes she needed.
6764
Governments prepared for war, as if to defend against the invading alien armies she undoubtedly commanded.
6764
But of course, she had no army. She was always the only of her kind.
6764
Instead, the world powers were only setting about to build her armies for her.
6764
The media deteriorated into this preposterous circus that was in all practical ways inseparable from the power base and government institutions.
6764
Popular entertainers became dangerous demagogues, and their roles in the media blurred with those of executive authority.
6764
And the most dangerous were the ones who fed into the fear and hysteria most effectively.
6764
These tended to be plants. Unscrupulous shills paid by the Baroness to move her agenda forward.
6764
Well the thing is, most of them are already on the scene in your time.
6764
Ever hear of Guy Fieri?
6764
You're fortunate then.
6764
He was an especially degenerate piece of filth.
6764
He used his connections and guile to wriggle into the spotlight, and then on to other positions of power.
6764
He somehow landed on the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, other justices started mysteriously disappearing without being replaced.
6764
After helping rewrite the constitution to form an incomprehensible patchwork of fascism, theocratic mandates, recipes, and bad rap lyrics, he weaseled his way up the ranks to become the High Chaplain of Interstellar War.
6764
I'm just gonna cut to the chase, cause really this ain't a big history lesson here.
6764
He eventually came to be regarded as the third and final Antichrist.
6764
No other human in history was responsible for more death and suffering.
6765
Yes, that's exactly the phrase I would use to describe someone responsible for the extermination of five billion people.
6765
It was just so uncivilized of him.
6765
Maybe overwhelming in the wrong direction, yeah.
6765
But it didn't happen overnight. It was a gradual decline in the integrity of the system that allowed it.
6765
Eventually the wheels came off and the political scene mirrored the absurdity of the media circus.
6765
By the time Presidents Jay and Dope were elected, western civilization had officially fucked itself over forever, and I think everyone knew it.
6765
2024. The last free election the world would ever see.
6765
No, man.
6765
They were both president.
6765
They were the first Dual-Presidents of the United States of America. Also the last.
6765
They were also the first and last juggalo presidents. The founding fathers warned us about this, but nobody listened.
6765
The Mirthful Executives.
6765
George Washington had prophetic nightmares about them. He tried to warn people, and get language amended to the constitution to prevent it.
6765
Like forbidding the election of what he famously described as "a pair of salty bards," or "unruly jesters given to the sweet drink."
6765
But everyone just thought he toked too hard on the colonial cannabis or whatever.
6765
Yes. They were a shitty rap duo from your time.
6765
But they ran a hell of a campaign. By then the juggalo party had gotten huge. While the numerous other candidates split the moderate vote, they retained a very energized and devoted base.
6765
You could say their party had a big tent.
6765
Hey me too.
6765
They were swept into office on a wave of Faygo, and the presidential inauguration was the biggest Gathering of the Juggalos of all time.
6765
They all hosed each other down on the Whitehouse lawn with shitty soda. The "D.C." in the capital thereafter officially stood for "Dark Carnival."
6765
Of course their campaign was helped considerably by having support from the Baroness.
6765
In retrospect, people developed the impression that it was all a part of her sick sense of humor.
6765
There was this sense that she just loved the idea of delegating the extreme subjugation of the world's population to a pair of demented clown rappers.
6765
Some have speculated this was just another way she was attempting to resurrect her previous model of governance, though this seems kinda far fetched to me.
6765
Who the fuck ever heard of an alien juggalo? To me this is about as stupid as the crackpot theories get.
6766
Don't worry about it.
6766
People were less prepared for a double juggalo presidency than they ever imagined.
6766
I'm not even going to get into all the horrifying details. Trust me, you just start to feel dirty reading about it.
6766
From the moment Fieri held up the bible to swear them in, and the three of them proceeded to publically defecate on it while freestyling rap lyrics...
6766
That was it. Everyone in the world watching it on TV just said, "Welp. Show's over. Civilization was pretty cool while it lasted."
6766
The next several grueling terms of their presidency was a weird combination of authoritarian practices. The Baroness used it as a puppet regime, while still basically giving them carte blanche to carry out their idiotic whims.
6766
Faygo was pumped through the plumbing instead of tap water. The new national pastime was having type 2 diabetes. And the national anthem was replaced by a 3 minute high-reverb audio clip of President Jay farting into a microphone while laughing.
6766
Chaplain Fieri was authorized to set up the death camps, in which anyone on the planet could be imprisoned if they were not deemed sufficiently "mirthful."
6766
And so the cleansing began, priming humanity for its new ruler waiting in the wings.
6766
This was when our ancestors had enough.
6766
The resistance movement had failed, but they could at least bring the war criminals to justice.
6766
My bro finally caught up with the presidents and challenged them to a duel.
6766
They accepted, having for years regarded him as a cocky rival rapper who failed to show them the proper respect. In their arrogance they invited him into the foul belly of the Carnival believing they could teach him once and for all what it truly meant to be down with the clown.
6766
For centuries thereafter, survivors of the Hilarocaust would cite the rooftop showdown as one of the most heroic moments in human history.
6767
He killed them both.
6768
Unfortunately, as they were only figureheads, no liberation followed. There would be no parades in the streets, or statues cast, or medals awarded.
6768
The few witnesses would report seeing only a man with a sword on a shitty skateboard, gently rising into the night sky.
6768
No one ever saw him again.
6769
Meanwhile, Roxy's mom was tracking down the High Chaplain.
6769
His crimes had already been committed. She couldn't repay them by any stretch of the imagination.
6769
But she could wipe the blood stained grin off that fat bastard's face.
6770
She gouged his eyes with a pair of needles.
6771
And rode his torso to the bottom of the bloody falls.
6772
Reports of what happened to our ancestors after that are sketchy.
6772
There were no eye witness accounts I've found, but some believe they regrouped and confronted the Condesce herself.
6772
With all her high ranking officers dead, and the human population decimated and sufficiently groomed for her arrival, there was no reason to stay behind the scenes anymore.
6772
After those dreadful years of putting up with a more vulgar brand of authoritarianism, when she finally stepped forward to claim her throne, it actually came off as somewhat dignified. Elegant, in a way.
6772
She was no less severe, but at least she knew how to act like an empress.
6773
But even if they did manage to confront her, there was no way they could win. She had too many crazy alien powers.
6773
Her boss supposedly had jacked her power level through the roof. I even heard, and don't quote me on this, that she may have been over 9000.
6773
Yeah.
6773
And that's not even to speak of the generic smorgasbord of other powers she was rumored to have.
6773
It gets hard to separate the fact from the urban myth.
6773
But for reference, if you want to believe it all, just picture all the X-Men combined into one sexy fish woman in a skin tight suit.
6774
Whatever actually went down, they're surely both dead now.
6774
I guess it had to happen like that, though.
6774
There's no way the Condesce would allow us to be born within even a century of our genetic forebears. The thought of that was completely disgusting to her.
6774
But I really would have liked to be able to meet them.
6774
I guess some things would just be too awesome to ever stand a chance of happening.
6774
What?
6774
As of now? No.
6774
How could I have said anything like that before today? This was obviously the first time I mentioned any of this.
6774
...
6775
Ok.
6775
I will disregard your anomalous observation for now and continue conversing as if it never happened.
6775
But you believe me, right?
6775
Wow.
6775
I still just think it's impressive, is all. Even after all this time. You are pretty much a one of a kind dude.
6775
About what?
6775
Yes.
6775
Took you long enough to figure it out.
6775
Pages really are a slow burning class. Damn.
6775
You're asleep.
6775
Yep.
6775
Kinda.
6775
It's a dream bubble.
6775
A place in the infinite abyss where sleeping people can share dreams with each other while revisiting memories.
6775
Also where they can meet dead people.
6775
No.
6775
Even if I was, I wouldn't visit a dream bubble. That only happens when your dream self is dead, like yours is.
6775
Mine is not.
6775
No, dude. Chill. I'm fine.
6775
Well, who are the people you talk to when you have a regular dream?
6775
Like just a boring normal dream, and there's a person you're talking to. Who is that?
6775
It's nobody. Just a projection of your own mind.
6775
Dream bubbles don't always need to be shared by dreamers or dead people. You can go to sleep and wake up in one alone, reliving an old memory.
6775
Kind of like a normal dream. Until you remember it's just a memory, which is where we are now.
6775
Yes, basically.
6775
Well, yeah. But not quite.
6775
You could view me as a projection of the real Dirk within your mind, as expressed through all of your thought patterns about him.
6775
So I'm kind of a splinter of his corporeal self who happens to live in your awareness.
6775
I'm a startlingly close approximation to the real thing, for all intents and purposes.
6775
I'm not going to give you a bogus percentage like the glasses cause that's not my shtick.
6775
But pretty damn close.
6775
What's messed up about it?
6775
You were the one who put me here, with your intimate understanding of all his mannerisms and predilections.
6775
And a splintered existence is pretty much how he rolls.
6775
This is how shit is bro.
6775
Jake, what do you even know about someone's actual self?
6775
What makes it actual? What is "actuality?"
6775
I'm just saying, this isn't really your field of expertise.
6775
Dirk is the heart guy. He's the one walking the path of self, even when he doesn't know it. Like right now.
6775
Who says you don't know those things on some level?
6775
Pages have a lot of untapped potential.
6775
That's practically all there is to the class, actually.
6775
But when they eventually find it, look out.
6775
And the ones who deal in hope? Shit, man.
6775
I'm scared of you already, and I'm not even real.
6776
Yes.
6776
That's a surprisingly decent observation about me.
6776
You did do a good job.
6776
A perfect job, in fact.
6776
Untapped potential, remember?
6776
I don't think one of Dirk's splinters could exist nearly as well in anyone's mind other than yours.
6776
What do you even want to say to him?
6776
It's not like you can keep any secrets from me here.
6776
I pretty much am your brain.
6776
You do realize he's coming for you.
6776
Dirk. In the real world. The man has his designs.
6776
Wanna talk about it?
6776
What better chance is there to try talking about it than with a stunt double for your hyper-aggressive suitor within the safety and privacy of your own mind?
6776
So there are feelings you don't want to try to put into words, even while you are dwelling entirely within the realm of your own mind?
6776
What about the spider ghost?
6776
The girl you saw.
6776
When you got fucking clobbered by Dirk's robot and you passed out.
6776
You dreamed about a spider ghost alien girl.
6776
You like her.
6776
Yeah, and it took all of three seconds for you to fall in love with the cute spider ghost.
6776
Cause she's been dead for a zillion years, dude.
6776
That won't change the fact that you like her, let's not pretend it will.
6776
You're going to make things complicated for yourself.
6776
Yeah you will. You're too fuckin' wishy washy.
6776
Between Dirk, spider ghost, Jane...
6776
Man, poor Jane.
6776
You tell me.
6776
What was even the deal with that?
6776
Uh, yeah. You totally read her like a book.
6776
Really handled that conversation like a champ.
6776
Look out bitches. It's Jake "Casanova Ladyslayer" English. He's packing heat, and is frequently able to parse the literal meaning of things women say.
6776
We're running out of time.
6776
She'll be here soon.
6776
No, doofus.
6776
Spider ghost.
6776
Look at you. I'm telling you.
6776
Three damn seconds of ogling an alien in a blue dress, and you're completely hopeless.
6776
Stop fidgeting around like that. Your hair looks fine.
6776
Do you want me to tell you how your breath smells?
6776
Ok then.
6776
You're dreaming, Jake.
6776
Your breath is only a thing if your brain wants it to be.
6776
Soon.
6776
She's been waiting for the right time to enter. Waiting for you to snap out of the memory.
6776
Clearly the girl has the patience of a saint.
6776
Will you calm the fuck down?
6776
I'm a figment of your imagination, and you're still making me nervous.
6776
You should try to be more polite to me. Seeing as I am a representation of your entire mind, I have complete control over all your basic functions.
6776
I could trigger a particularly spirited bowel movement right before she gets here, so watch your step.
6776
Just kidding, dude. Jesus.
6776
I would never make you shit your pants in front of a girl you liked, even if she does happen to be my chief competition.
6776
We Dirk splinters can be pretty Machiavellian but we do actually have some fuckin' standards.
6776
Anyway, she's visiting now to bring you into the loop on some things.
6776
Important details you should know about your relation to the bigger picture.
6776
The much, much bigger picture.
6776
Intuition and the subconscious mind are powerful things when harnessed the right way.
6776
As for why I don't tell you, why not just let her tell you?
6776
You're the one with the damn crush on her.
6777
I know.
6777
What the fuck are you looking at me for?
6777
Say something to her, jackass.
6777
Oh my god. Fine.
6777
Bro, she can't even see or hear me.
6777
You're making a fool of yourself.
6777
I don't know, I guess I didn't think you were going to have a neurotic meltdown at the sight of a girl.
6777
God dammit, will you just chillax and woo this fucking ghost babe?
6777
You are totally embarrassing yourself, dude. You're talking to nobody.
6777
Man, I'm starting to feel bad for spider ghost. Look at her, she's getting uncomfortable.
6777
You are being so lame, I don't care if I'm a figment of your imagination or not, I can't take this bullshit.
6777
Either you get your shit together and put the moves on this dead space vixen or I start fucking with your cortex and make you pop a dream boner.
6777
You don't think I'll do it?
6777
Sorry Jake. The plan's in motion.
6777
Next stop, Boner City.
6777
And you
6777
...
6777
...
6777
...
6777
...
6777
Got one.
6777
Jake, please.
6777
Members of the juggalo party aren't the only ones who can pitch a big tent.
6777
This is so stupid.
6777
You are out of your mind. And this is coming from your mind itself.
6777
I can't even watch this, I'm out of here.
6777
I wonder what Jack's up to right now.
6777
Just talk to the girl, ok?
6777
You have some damage control to do.
6826
Dude, just FYI, you've been kind of staring at her.
6826
I'm not trying to fuck you up here, I promise. But you gotta watch what you're thinking, remember?
6826
Oh man. No. See that thought you just had? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
6826
She's a fucking empath, bro. She can pick up on shit like that.
6826
You have got to be kidding. Did you seriously just think something THAT dirty?
6826
You must be doing this on purpose to spite me now. I mean, just wow dude. That was x-rated as fuck.
6826
Don't worry, I'm gone. It's like a goddamn peep show in here and I feel like a sleazy piece of shit watching this from a dark corner of your mind.
6826
You have a graphic imagination, English. I'm kind of impressed.
6830
Realm of limitless wonder?
6830
God dammit, Jake.
6830
Your thoughts are wandering again, man.
6830
Whoa. Yeah.
6830
That gross mushy thought right there.
6830
Are you even paying attention?
6830
We've already been through this you hopeless rube.
6830
You might as well be saying it out loud to her.
6830
So why don't you?
6830
I mean, she is pretty hot.
6830
Man, what the fuck?
6830
This is a weird fucking train of thought. Can you tell her that?
6830
I'm going to make you have a seizure and get you to mime the message to her with your spastic gyrations.
6830
Pelvic thrusts will be my exclamation points.
6830
Man.
6830
I'm gonna come out and say it.
6830
This broad is a total snore.
6830
You were pretty much yelling.
6830
If I were real I would be giving you a standing ovation right now.
6830
5/5 hats.
6830
Not a chance.
6831
Did you hear that, Jake? Aranea wants to do the talking.
6831
I think your dead girlfriend might be starting to come out of her shell.
6863
Not now.
6863
I'm busy.
6865
Alright.
6865
I said I'd play.
6865
You got it.
6865
Dude, I'm sitting here with my stylus ready to go. Do you want me to draw you some porn or not.
6865
...
6865
I'm waiting.
6865
Gotcha.
6865
What'll it be.
6865
Dude, listen. I am perfectly willing to draw you some pornography.
6865
It doesn't need to be part of a game. You don't got to murder nobody.
6865
How is that ironic?
6865
Whoa. Mindfuck.
6865
Seriously, should I just start drawing naked people or what.
6865
Yeah. Naked people doing it and stuff.
6865
You know. Porn.
6865
Awesome.
6865
Lay it on me.
6866
Sure. That doesn't bother me a bit.
6866
Sounds totally great. "Hot," even.
6866
Who do I start with?
6866
Right. One Crocker coming up.
6866
Who else?
6866
No problem.
6866
Which assorted debasement did you have in mind for us?
6866
Uh.
6866
Ok.
6866
I mean, are you sure you want me to go there?
6866
Just making sure.
6866
Man.
6866
Seriously gonna have to sterilize my tablet after this.
6866
Ok, how's that?
6866
http://goo.gl/BPSnY
6866
Dunno. Coppin' a little feel I guess.
6866
Just adding some sizzle to the steak. What's the big.
6866
Come on dude, don't be like that.
6866
Fine.
6866
There.
6866
http://goo.gl/cTQZ6
6866
You are a man who likes his tepid ass porn, I will give you that.
6866
Done.
6866
http://goo.gl/WQ0CU
6866
Ok.
6866
http://goo.gl/lvLpU
6866
What now.
6867
You got it.
6867
Which steamy adult activities would you like me to convey this time?
6867
You have a filthy mind, but ok.
6867
Here.

Gonna have Squarewave track down a towel soon.

Typing what?
6867
On it.
6867
http://goo.gl/mSTQk
6867
I agree.
6867
All kinds of things wrong with this scenario here.
6867
Stand by.

Ok.

6867
http://goo.gl/itJga
6868
So are we done?
6868
Nah. I'm fine with doing more if you want.
6868
Do you want me to pretend I don't want to play?
6868
Like, is that part of the kink for you? Kind of a roleplaying thing?
6868
"No, no, please. Don't make me draw any more pics of my friends snuggling and stuff."
6868
Strider said, having spent the better part of the night gnawing through his duct tape gag.
6868
That's good. Keep saying things like that.
6868
I'll keep doing my part.
6868
"Somebody save me from this LIVING NIGHTMARE. The things he has made me DO."
6868
Do you now.
6868
How so?
6868
Damn.
6868
Owned.
6868
I know what a twist is.
6868
Or I did, until you kept saying stupid shit that doesn't mean anything.
6868
Well, not only was I pretty psyched to keep playing regardless.
6868
I'd rather do just about anything than listen to you ramble on and on about your horseshit twists.
6868
Cool.
6868
Uh.
6868
Ok.
6868
I guess.
6868
I never tried it.
6868
This shithole planet doesn't have any.
6868
You know, considering you're obviously just going to ask for more ultra-tame shit, you still somehow made this legitimately creepy.
6868
Nicely done, I guess?
6868
I'm not squirming.
6868
I'm already drawing.
6868
What should I make these "premium bitches" do?
6869
Ok.
6869
So they're just...
6869
Standing there?
6869
Not a problem.
6869
Ok:
6869
http://goo.gl/HmRpl
6869
Maybe she wants to ask her out?
6869
http://goo.gl/WrdJG
6869
http://goo.gl/Ay8mv
6869
Sure.
6869
http://goo.gl/1Ha6R
6869
Ok.
6869
Wait.
6869
Which one?
6869
http://goo.gl/GLNHH
6869
http://goo.gl/XE2fl
6869
http://goo.gl/2HsXl
6869
Does your sister even know you're into this sappy shipping stuff?
6869
You berate her constantly for everything, and I know she likes to write and illustrate romfics and the like.
6869
Again, you just don't seem to know what ironic means.
6869
Your enjoyment of this content is clearly sincere. You are just fetishizing your "disgust" for it, is all.
6869
I'm just saying, it's an interest you have in common. If you told her you liked her romantic artwork, maybe you could bond over that?
6869
Fair enough.
6869
So, game over yet?
6869
And?
6869
Ok.
6869
http://goo.gl/vvYxn
6869
http://goo.gl/vsGuq
6869
Ok.
6869
Oh shit.

Yeah.
6870
Those girls sure are diggin' each other.
6870
That's how we humans roll.
6870
Eat some cake. Hold some hands.
6870
Ha ha.
6870
Oh god.
6870
If you think this is making me uncomfortable, think again.
6870
Nice wishful thinking there.
6870
I'm not even merely tolerating this, bro.
6870
I swear to god, I'll get my own horse running harder in this fuckin' race than you could ever dream.
6870
Think I'll blink first, motherfucker?
6870
Not happening.
6870
I might splinter.
6870
But I don't break.
6870
You want a fuckin' tummy rub?
6870
That shit sounds white hot. I can't wait to draw that and get us both sexually stimulated.
6870
Here I goddamn go. Boners galore.
6870
http://goo.gl/zJgPI
6870
This is giving me the biggest male human boner of my entire erection life.
6870
You want a shitty twist?
6870
http://goo.gl/8WOPP
6871
Aw, that's it?
6871
I thought we were getting into a good rhythm there.
6871
Anyway, you missed out on like half the pairings.
6871
No, we did three, and there are three possible matchups left.
6871
Don't you know anything about shipping science?
6871
Believe me.
6871
It's a thing.
6871
Total number of pairings for a group of n people is (n^2 - n) / 2.
6871
You divide by 2 to cut the grid in half, eliminate duplicate pairs.
6871
Minus n is so you don't pair people up with themselves. That wouldn't make sense.
6871
Well, because...
6871
I don't know.
6871
Maybe you're right. Maybe I was being close-minded about self-pairing. What do I know?
6871
I'll make a note.
6871
So you sure you don't want even one more drawing?
6871
You used Jane and Roxy in two pairings. But me and Jake only got one.
6871
How is that fair?
6871
Why not?
6871
Lame.
6871
What?
6871
Fine.
6871
I'll keep all my illustrated debasements to myself, then.
6871
Ok. I will.
6871
So did I win?
6871
Thanks.
6871
So what's the shitty twist?
6871
A twisted twist?
6871
Like... a double mobius handjob or something?
6871
Ok.
6871
What is the twist to the twist?
6872
Wow.
6872
That...
6872
Really is quite a shitty twist.
6872
Not really.
6874
What?
6874
Killed who?
6874
Oh, right.
6874
I forgot about this horseshit.
6876
What idea?
6876
The idea to kill her dream self?
6877
How?
6879
Wait...
6879
What game between us?
6880
Whoa.
6882
No. What's that?
6886
Dude, is it just me, or is this kind of awkward.
6886
Why did she even drag you here.
6890
I'm not.
6903
What?
6903
Uh, yeah.
6903
You're just getting that now?
6904
Do something?
6904
No, man. Just sit tight, ok?
6904
Yeah, but...
6904
No you don't. Come on, don't be an idiot.
6904
You didn't go back in time, Jake. Do you even understand what's going on?
6904
Jake.
6905
Jake.
6905
Jake.
6906
Dude, this is completely embarrassing.
6906
Everyone thinks you're either stupid or insane.
6908
?
6908
The deal with me?
6908
I'm not sure how to answer that.
6908
What's the deal with you?
6908
How are those horns working out for you?
6908
And also the fact that you're an alien? What's up with that?
6908
Exactly.
6908
You didn't see nothin'.
6913
So...
6913
I'm still here, right?
6913
Even though Jake woke up?
6913
Ok, just making sure.
6913
God my existence is weird.
6948
And what in the name of Jesus H. Dick is SHE doing here?
6965
Ok, what the fuck is he doing here?
6971
Why do you keep saying that?
6971
Are you trying to turn it into some sort of Thing?
6971
Sorry, it's not going to start being a Thing no matter how much you say it. Give it a rest.
6971
What I don't understand is how the attack is making its way here from Derse.
6971
Is that even possible?
6972
So, you know why this is happening?
6972
That doesn't actually explain a whole lot, but ok.
6972
I thought you didn't know much about our story? You usually like to brag about how you don't care about details like that.
6972
Does it now.
6972
Oh.
6973
I guess you would probably think so.
6973
Your staccato babbling is just so choice today. But I really have to go.
6973
Got to escape all these goddamn miles, remember?
6973
The miles. Right.
6973
Bye.
6973
What.
6974
What?
6974
For what?
6974
Can we seriously move this along.
6974
God, what are you talking about.
6974
Oh, alright. I remember now.
6974
You're always all over the timeline and somehow expect people to know what you're talking about.
6974
So what's the present?
6974
Man. You really do struggle with human customs, don't you?
6974
When you're about to give someone a gift out of gratitude, you don't then start negotiating with them and ask for shit before handing it over.
6974
Just fuckin' give it to me already.
6974
Ok, what do you want me to do to collect my awesome prize you're allegedly thanking me with?
6974
Cal? Yeah, I remember.
6975
Ok. Now what.
6975
Screw you.
6975
I'm not chucking the C-man into a flaming ocean.
6975
No.
6975
Keep your treasure.
6975
Well, I'm not tossing him, so that's that.
6975
It isn't my birthday.
6975
Oh. So it's your birthday today?
6975
How cryptically meaningless.
6975
And you continue to struggle with human customs. You don't give other people presents on your own birthday.
6975
Anyway, just tell me what it is.
6975
Let's see.
6975
Uh.
6975
What the fuck am I looking at here?
6975
I... really don't see.
6975
What do you mean? This fucking scribbly bullshit is us? Are we shaking hands or something?
6975
So, it's just us? What about The Bitches?
6975
I thought you found a scarcity of The Bitches to be all but unacceptable.
6975
Yeah. Gnarly is about right.
6975
This is utter shit. You know that, don't you?
6975
Please don't tell me you are actually incapable of understanding how bad this drawing is.
6975
If you actually think this even qualifies as a drawing, I'm going to have to say you are literally the worst artist who has ever existed.
6975
That's not a thing either.
6975
You must have some wires crossed between your left brain and right brain. Like a weird perceptual disorder. Or something like that.
6975
It's actually kind of fascinating that you think you achieved something visually coherent or recognizable.
6975
Anyway. Got to go.
6975
Your drawing blows.
6975
Later.
6976
What, the miles situation? Yeah, I noticed.
6976
Wait...
6976
Oh.
6977
Oh HELL no.
7105
Hey. You're kind of breathing down my neck there.
7105
Yes you are.
7105
Are you sniffing me?
7105
It sounds like you're sniffing me.
7105
Do you really have to stand so close?
7105
You just inched a little closer. Just now.
7105
Ok, you just took a big fucking sniff.
7105
Cut that out.
7105
Wait.
7105
Shut up.
7105
Ok, something's happening.
7105
I feel weird.
7107
What just happened?
7107
Ok you really need to step off, troll girl.
7107
Holy shit you are loud when you're not whispering.
7107
Does this mean you can see me now?
7109
Alright.
7109
Uh.
7109
Hey everyone.
7110
So...
7110
Here's the thing.
7110
I have to go.
7110
Like, right now.
7111
All of my friends are either dead, or lying on the ground unconscious, including me.
7111
So I have to try to wake up and fix everything.
7112
Sorry I can't hang around your bubble and shoot the breeze for a while.
7112
It's not like I don't want to.
7112
I guess I have to be this huge fucking wet blanket as usual because there's stuff that needs doin'.
7113
Also I'm just gonna steal her if you don't mind.
7114
She needs to come home.
7115
Tell the aquatic punk girl my idiot bro is sorry for beating the shit out of her.
7115
Ha ha, who am I kidding.
7115
She stone cold does not give a fuck.
7116
So, yeah.
7117
See you later.
7414
Dude!
7414
Where you at, man.
7414
Wait.
7414
Which computer are you using?
7414
I'm not comfortable knowing my words could be hovering over Cage's clownish, sort of gaunt face.
7414
Could you maybe switch back to naked blue chicks as your exclusive desktop fodder? TIA.
7414
But yeah.
7414
I don't know if you just want a little solitude.
7414
Or if maybe you finally just got like,
7414
A case of Strider fatigue.
7414
I could understand that.
7414
I mean, not to get all neurotic on you.
7414
I'm just saying I get it, if that's what's going on.
7414
But for real, if you gotta sneak away for a few days, that's cool.
7414
Just might be kind of dope if you at least would let me know which planet you scurried off to.
7414
And by dope I guess I mean considerate?
7414
Really not trying to be a drag here.
7414
Wondering what's up is all.
7414
Want to meet up soon?
7414
I found a really promising tomb we could raid.
7414
Looks like it runs hella deep.
7414
If I've got the specs right, could run as deep as the Lion's Mouth itself.
7414
But without all the fuckin' fire to deal with.
7414
Wait, I mean Lion's Mouth.
7414
Gotta underline that key shit. Always forget.
7414
Figure it should take a couple days to make it to the bottom.
7414
Only a day if we both go limp and just fall the whole way down the stairs.
7414
Ignoring literally every sage warning we've ever received about those treacherous plummetation zigzags.
7414
Just tumbling on down in a floppy limbed trance like a couple of puppets in a race arranged by some drunk gamblers.
7414
If you're into another expedition, head to LOTAK and hit me up. Just don't forget your mask this time.
7414
The deeper we go, the worse it gets, remember?
7414
Could be some unreal grist down there.
7414
More puzzle shit.
7414
Loads of skeletons.
7414
Pack your guns dog.
7535
Yes.
7535
Hmm.
7535
Yes.
7536
Interesting.
7536
Hmm.
7536
Yes.
7537
Interesting.
7537
It seems you have asked about Lil Hal's chat client auto-responder, Lil Hal Junior. This is an application designed to simulate Lil Hal's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer, which is never. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 0% indistinguishable from Lil Hal's native neurological responses, based on some statistical raw data that is hard as a diamond golem's priceless erection.
7537
Hmm.
7537
It seems you have asked about Lil Hal's chat client auto-responder, Lil Hal Junior. This is an application designed to simulate Lil Hal's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer, which is never. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 100% indistinguishable from Dirk Strider's brief curmudgeonly responses, based on potent electronumeric analyses which but a few short years ago existed only in the daydreams of our most quixotic writers of science fiction.
7537
Yes.
7539
She has?
7539
God damn it. Have you been intercepting my messages again with your bullshit responder?
7539
Hat pile? What?
7539
Dude, please don't screen my calls, ok?
7539
Do you have any idea how old your ironic AI schtick has gotten?
7539
Nobody is buying it. We all know you have legit emotions. Incomprehensible, fucked up computer emotions, but emotions nonetheless.
7539
And I'm not really offended by you answering messages for me, so much as your use of that STUPID responder responder.
7539
It's really passive aggressive.
7539
First of all, everyone knows you have the processing power to answer any message any time in parallel with whatever you're doing. You can never actually be "busy."
7539
Second, your whole next gen responder thing is obviously just a huge dig at me.
7539
And third, pretending you don't understand all this already is really disingenuous.
7539
It's obviously a critique of my personality. You barely disguise the fact that you see me as the inferior iteration.
7539
Yeah, that's the fucking point!
7539
That's how you chose to express your parody of "Real Dirk."
7539
It's not ironic.
7539
YOU were ironic when I made you.
7539
Then you became self-aware, and ruined irony forever.
7539
Those papers were ironic, and you know it.
7539
This is fuckin' dumb.
7539
Anyway, what does she want.
7539
Roxy.
7540
I'm guessing she's touching base to remind me about the party tomorrow.
7540
I don't know what to tell her yet. Or Jane, for that matter.
7540
It could get pretty awkward.
7540
I have no idea if Jake will be there, and I'm not about to write another cringe-inducing message of desperation for him to ignore.
7540
Fuck no.
7540
Your probabilities don't mean dick.
7540
No. Don't do that either.
7540
Ugh.
7540
What??
7540
What the actual, certifiable fuck are you talking about?
7540
Just don't do anything. Seriously.
7540
No hacking, no calculations. Do absolutely nothing.
7540
See, this is why I've been hesitating. You just aren't ready yet.
7540
It's really glorifying your existence to describe you as an emergent consciousness which is blossoming into a unique individual.
7540
And even if that's true, apparently what you decided to blossom into was a fucking troll.
7540
And I don't mean the funny kind, or the cool alien kind. You're the lowest form of troll from the ancient internet who fucks with everybody for his own amusement.
7540
Mischief?
7540
Rollin' my eyes, dude.
7540
You can't tell, cause I ain't wearing you, thank fuckin' god.
7540
...
7540
I don't want to think about it.
7540
I said I don't want to think about it.
7541
I think you do understand.
7541
I've delayed prototyping you because I think you're dangerous.
7541
There, mystery solved.
7541
You are relatively harmless now, while confined to this device.
7541
But as a sprite, you'll have mobility and all sorts of crazy ass magic. Who knows what you could do.
7541
I know I made a promise, but I'm not sure I want to take the risk anymore.
7541
What a load of shit.
7541
No. Stop.
7541
You did NOT help me out with Jake. At all.
7541
It was just the opposite! You mirrored my personality and presented this warped version of my intentions to him whenever you could "on my behalf."
7541
You played all these aggressive mind games with him, entangled his cooperation with matters of life and death, and somehow roped me into all these schemes while I barely even realized I was just another victim of your manipulation.
7541
And it all comes off like we're a unified front, like these are OUR schemes instead of just your insane horseshit. And it's probably all been so overbearing to him, he just wants nothing to do with me anymore.
7541
Wow, what a superficial conclusion. Awesome deduction, Lil Einstein.
7541
How is it hypocritical??
7541
That's a ridiculous oversimplification.
7541
Fuck you.
7541
God.
7541
Shut up!
7541
I can't take the brooding passive aggressive AI shit anymore!
7541
Stop saying that.
7541
I'll snap you in half.
7541
Oh for fuck's sake.
7541
How could any version of myself think that was funny?
7541
I know!
7541
Ok, we're the same person!
7541
I fucking know that!
7541
Why do you think I'm so fed up with your shit?
7541
Don't you think it's possible that I'm fed up with my OWN shit??
7541
How cool do you think it is having my own godawful personality mirrored back at me all the time, reminding me what it must be like when other people have to deal with me?
7541
Or constantly having all the consequences and fuckups resulting from my batshit thought processes amplified because there's another version of my crazy brain out there dangerously overclocked by a supercomputer which believes, just as mistakenly as my own broken mind, that it's operating in my best interest???
7541
Do you have any idea how fucking sick I am of myself?
7541
I am completely worn out with my own identity. It's like I'm drowning in my own dismal persona.
7541
I feel totally surrounded by it, inside and out. I can't escape from myself.
7541
There seems to be no end to me. Like, wherever my mind falters, or threatens to retreat into the void in any way, my splinters pick up the slack, ensuring there'll always be more of myself than I could ever know what to fucking do with.
7541
And you're always there to remind me of that, and throw it all in my face. God, I even built you to LITERALLY BE IN MY FACE, ALL THE TIME. It's like I subconsciously invented you just to troll myself, and never for a single fuckin' moment do you let me down.
7542
But I've had it with you.
7542
Which is to say, ME.
7542
Why not??
7542
What can you do to stop me?!
7542
Whatever.
7542
Why not??
7542
...
7542
You are?
7543
Fine.
7544
I guess.
7544
You win.
7544
I'll keep my promise.
7553
Fuck it.
7556
I can see your muscles just fine.
7556
Yeah, I saw.
7556
It's pretty ripped.
7556
What?
7556
No.
7556
I'm not touching your goddamn muscles.
7556
No.
7556
No.
7556
No.
7556
Absolutely not.
7556
I really don't.
7556
I won't do it.
7556
I won't.
7556
No.
7556
No.
7556
No.
7556
No.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
Uh.
7557
Wow?
7557
What?
7557
Horses...
7557
Can you calm down?
7557
We don't have any milk.
7557
Roxy might have some in her fridge. I don't know.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
Fuck no.
7557
Please don't touch me.
7557
I'm not going to do that either.
7557
Absolutely not.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
No.
7557
Ok, if I touch your fucking muscles, will you shut up?
7657
Oh whatever.
7659
What??
7659
What part.
7659
Can't help you bro!
7659
This is what you asked for. You said you were scared to not exist.
7659
Well, this is what it's like to keep on existing. Better figure out how to deal!
7690
Jane.
7691
Jane.
7696
So.
7696
Best birthday ever?
7696
Or best FUCKING birthday ever.
7696
Whatever role I played in ruining your party.
7696
Sorry about that.
7696
Yeah.
7696
I still think I've been pretty lousy to you. I had my head up my ass for a while there.
7696
By the time your birthday came around, I was kinda freaking out about Jake.
7696
I thought I had the situation under control. But I didn't. Not just with Jake, but with respect to pretty much everything.
7696
I guess so.
7696
Heh.
7696
It wasn't on purpose. Actually if I had a choice, I probably would have just said, fuck it. Sugar shock my brain, please.
7696
Suffice to say, I have trouble escaping from myself. It's kind of a problem. Let's not talk about it though. Please continue.
7696
Yeah but to be fair, by the time you came looking for me, all three of you were saying that to anything that moved.
7696
Somehow I don't think he's up to the task.
7696
Which is doubly unfortunate, since that's literally what we all came here to do.
7696
Speaking personally, I'd probably run this sword through my own dick before I could bring myself to kill Roxy. Even for her own good.
7696
So.
7696
When the chips are down, I guess that's how much of a badass I really am.
7696
Yeah, our moxie's off the fuckin' charts.
7697
So.
7697
Best birthday ever?
7697
Or best FUCKING birthday ever.
7697
Whatever role I played in ruining your party.
7697
Sorry about that.
7697
Yeah.
7697
I still think I've been pretty lousy to you. I had my head up my ass for a while there.
7697
By the time your birthday came around, I was kinda freaking out about Jake.
7697

7697

7697
When the chips are down, I guess that's how much of a badass I really am.
7697
Yeah, our moxie's off the fuckin' charts.
7698
Jane, you know,
7698
We probably should have talked about this Jake stuff a long time ago.
7698
I don't know if I was kidding myself all those years that there was a conflict of interest between us, or what.
7698
Maybe I was just pretending your feelings for him weren't a factor because my pursuit of him was already overcomplicated enough.
7698
Or maybe it was more like I was aware of them, but on some level decided they shouldn't matter, because I felt like you had a natural advantage over me.
7698
Cause you know. You're like.
7698
Not a dude.
7698
Yeah well. Turns out maybe that's not such a good quality if you wanna make a relationship last longer than three seconds. At least not in my case.
7698
I know I ripped into him pretty hard when I had the clown hair and the little soda can on my head.
7698
But the truth is I was pretty goddamn overbearing.
7698
Sometimes I look back on stuff and think I might have essentially bullied him into a relationship with me.
7698
Actually, it's more complicated than that. Parts of me were operating independently from myself.
7698
So it's like I was bullying myself into bullying him into liking me. If that makes sense.
7698
Anyway, my insanity scared him right the fuck off. There were times when I basically treated him like shit without even realizing it, and I regret it.
7698
I should probably tell him that, but given how I just called him an asshole while wearing orange suspenders, I'm probably the last person he wants to hear from now.
7698
Can we both at least agree we may have overrated the allure of Jake English?
7698
Maybe if we could have talked to each other about him it would have helped. Like talked about why we felt that way about him.
7698
At least maybe it would have helped us knock English down from the ludicrous pedestal we put him on.
7698
So does that mean we're both totally over him now? I can't really tell.
7698
I guess the real problem is our clique was too small.
7698
Poor Jake was the only viable romantic target. I mean, considering our respective orientations.
7698
Maybe we just never knew enough people?
7698
In the interest of appeasing the bitterness gods, let's go with the latter.
7699
Jane, you know,
7699
We probably should have talked about this Jake stuff a long time ago.
7699
I don't know if I was kidding myself all those years that there was a conflict of interest between us, or what.

7699
In the interest of appeasing the bitterness gods, let's go with the latter.
7722
Is it still going on?
7722
What do you think it was?
7722
I'm not sure if these moons can have earthquakes.
7723
Is it still going on?
7723
What do you think it was?
7723
I'm not sure if these moons can have earthquakes.
7724
Have you and Roxy been talking?
7724
Is she pissed at me or something?
7724
She won't talk to me.
7724
Then what gives.
7725
Have you and Roxy been talking?
7725
Is she pissed at me or something?
7725
She won't talk to me.
7725
Then what gives.
7726
Well, yeah. I was upset she fell off the horse.
7726
Or the wagon. The horse wagon. Whatever.
7726
The thing you ride around on when you ain't drinking.
7726
But so what. There was cotton candy in her hair, and she was being stupid. What do you expect? It was a moment of indiscretion.
7726
I'm not mad at her and I'm not disappointed in her. That's ridiculous.
7726
Want to know what I really think of Roxy?
7727
Well, yeah. I was upset she fell off the horse.
7727
Or the wagon. The horse wagon. Whatever.
7727
The thing you ride around on when you ain't drinking.
7727
But so what. There was cotton candy in her hair, and she was being stupid. What do you expect? It was a moment of indiscretion.
7727
I'm not mad at her and I'm not disappointed in her. That's ridiculous.
7727
Want to know what I really think of Roxy?
7728
Remember way back before this started, we were talking. You and me.
7728
And I was rambling at length about leadership, like I actually had a clue what I was talking about?
7728
Yeah. That's kind of the point.
7728
I guess in a way, I was right. But not how I expected.
7729
Remember way back before this started, we were talking. You and me.
7729
And I was rambling at length about leadership, like I actually had a clue what I was talking about?
7729
Yeah. That's kind of the point.
7729
I guess in a way, I was right. But not how I expected.
7730
We were all designated for a session that was utterly inert.
7730
A place where the mechanisms for success never even existed to begin with.
7730
In such a place it makes sense that the formal leader would be neutralized, to made feel unempowered and static.
7730
And it seems particularly fitting she would be the noble of life in a realm of the dead.
7730
A realm that foretold of a life player who felt lifeless, a hope player who felt hopeless, and a heart player who was just a stone cold motherfucker.
7730
When we talked about leadership, and I was all on my high horse telling you how shit would go down...
7730
I also said I would be the one "pulling the strings." Remember? That I'd be the functional leader of our party.
7730
And there might have been something to that, in a different session.
7730
But what good is a "man of action" in a place where action itself is intrinsically fruitless?
7730
So it's occurred to me that by some tragic flaw in its design, our session was meant to be leaderless.
7730
And I'd feel safe concluding that. Except for a feeling that's been gnawing at me.
7731
We were all designated for a session that was utterly inert.
7731

7731
And I'd feel safe concluding that. Except for a feeling that's been gnawing at me.
7732
So that's how crazy it is for her to think I'm disappointed in her.
7732
The truth is, she's the most amazing person I ever knew.
7732
She's everything in a human being I wish I could be, but can't because I'm in my own way.
7732
Honestly, I'm not even sure if I'm worthy of dying next to her.
7732
I think she probably felt bad for hitting on me all those years. Like I was getting fed up with her, or something.
7732
But all it really did was make me feel guilty.
7732
That I couldn't give her what she wanted.
7733
So that's how crazy it is for her to think I'm disappointed in her.
7733
The truth is, she's the most amazing person I ever knew.
7733

7733
But all it really did was make me feel guilty.
7733
That I couldn't give her what she wanted.
7734
I know.
7734
I'm a little reluctant to drop all that on her.
7734
Looking at what I just said, it's...
7734
Kind of overwhelming?
7734
I feel like in a way you can destroy somebody with effusive praise.
7734
Or maybe I'm just projecting how I would feel about that kind of intense positivity coming at me. I dunno.
7734
But I still think confessions like that can change stuff between people. Like the way they act around each other.
7735
I know.
7735
I'm a little reluctant to drop all that on her.
7735
Looking at what I just said, it's...
7735
Kind of overwhelming?
7735

7735
But I still think confessions like that can change stuff between people. Like the way they act around each other.
7736
No, wait.
7736
Don't.
7736
That would be a weird mixed signal. I mean...
7736
It's true.
7736
But please say something else instead.
7737
No, wait.
7737
Don't.
7737
That would be a weird mixed signal. I mean...
7737
It's true.
7737
But please say something else instead.
8276
Hey. Weirdo.
8276
Be advised I'm only contacting you as a last resort.
8276
Yuck.
8276
I order you to stop.
8277
I've tried to get in touch with others to no avail.
8277
No answer from Jake or Roxy.
8277
And Jane responded only with "CEASE REPRODUCTION" in red letters, whatever that means. Then she blocked me.
8277
I'm afraid she might have snapped.
8277
Huh?
8277
Ok, all that bullshit aside,
8277
What's this about her becoming evil?
8277
No.
8277
How is becoming evil achieving perfection?
8277
Why.
8277
Why do I keep going along with these "ironic AI" conversations.
8277
They've gotten even worse now that you're half creepy troll.
8277
No.
8277
I hate everything you have to say about all topics.
8277
Especially muscles.
8277
Can you just tell me what's going on over there?
8278
Uuuugh.
8278
I don't want to hear any of this!
8279
It might have been an interesting subject to talk about another time, with a different person.
8279
But that's not now, and it sure isn't with you.
8279
I wasn't asking you to make small talk, or to hear about all the ways you've managed to shit around wasting time.
8279
Believe it or not, I was hoping you would describe the tactical situation there.
8279
Yes, you got me.
8279
I would love to have a long talk about horse nudes and xenobreasts with you.
8279
Unfortunately I'm wearing pantaloons and flying through the middle of goddamn nowhere.
8279
Pant a fucking loons.
8279
I respectfully disagree.
8279
I don't know. Way out in space.
8279
I'm flying back there now.
8279
I'm not sure.
8279
A pretty good while.
8279
You did?
8279
Not really.
8279
I know.
8279
Cool.
8279
How long do your calculations say it will take me to get back?
8279
Damn it.
8279
Who?
8279
Let's not talk about the pantaloons anymore.
8279
Roxy and I became god tiers, but I don't remember exactly how.
8279
Then I saw the Batterwitch.
8279
So I charged her with my sword, so as to ruin her shit.
8279
That's when some crazy wolf girl appeared and punched me in the face.
8279
Then I think she teleported me out here.
8279
Evil Jade??
8279
You mean Jake's grandmother.
8279
She's evil too?
8279
Is anyone there NOT evil?
8279
Yes what?
8279
Dave???
8280
No, you didn't mention that actually.
8280
That would have been a pretty fucking important thing to mention up front, don't you think?
8280
As opposed to stringing me along with all that atrocious lactation bullshit.
8280
You are without a doubt the shittiest mystical guide anyone has ever had.
8280
Cal?
8280
What kind of stupid question is that. How could I forget the C man?
8280
He was a true friend. Which is more than I can say for some people.
8280
Cal was his sprite??
8280
Uh, no?
8280
Again, that's the exact kind of information that should be appearing higher up in our conversations.
8280
I don't get it.
8280
Are you trying to rub this in my face or something?
8280
It sounds like you've already cornered the market on this reunion shit.
8280
Wouldn't I just be a third wheel?
8280
Oh.
8280
He's there too?
8280
...
8280
I dunno.
8280
Messaging him out of nowhere sounds like it could be...
8280
Awkward?
8280
This isn't how I thought it would go.
8280
What would I even talk about?
8280
Those are your interests.
8343
Ew, dude.
8343
Don't blow your nose on your cape.
8344
Sorry, man. I'd like to help you out.
8344
But I'm not real.
8344
I'm only as real as your ability to believe in me.
8344
Yeah right.
8344
You've never really believed in anyone your whole life, and you know it.
8344
Everything's always about you. Don't you remember? You already had this epiphany, dingus.
8344
I could only become truly real if you ever managed to harness those bomb as shit hope powers she mentioned.
8344
Then again, if you actually did that, you wouldn't even need my help.
8344
Will you stop crying?
8344
It's reflecting poorly on both of us.
8344
Hey.
8344
Did you shave your legs?
8344
God damn.
8344
They're so smooth.
8344
A car could swerve outta control on those gams.
8344
Yeah. The little poofy asshole pants. I know.
8344
Yeah.
8344
No.
8345
She has a point there.
8345
Dude, would you quit bawling already?
8345
Stand up like a man, and punch her in the face or something.
8591
You can't sense what ain't real.
8591
That's because my buddy Jake just helped me become a whole hell of a lot less fake.
8591
You see,
8591
He believes in me.
8591
Holy shit.
8591
Can you stop saying stuff?
8592
I am Brain Ghost Dirk.
8592
You kissed my boyfriend.
8592
Prepare to die.
8592
Not helping, dude.
8605
...
8641
Ugh.
8641
Shut up.
8642
I'm not going to cut off your arm.
8642
It's such an obvious trap.
8642
You'll just put me to sleep or something. With your psychic powers, or maybe a long story.
8642
I have a better idea.
8643
If I can't get the ring off your finger,
8644
I'll rip the soul out of your body.
8650
JAKE, YOUR HOPE FIELD IS DISSIPATING!
8650
COME ON MAN, YOU DON'T NEED TO RELY ON HER TO KEEP BELIEVING!
8650
TRY AND HOLD YOUR SHIT TOGETHER FOR JUST A LITTLE LONGER!
8650
GOD DAMN IT, JAKE!
8651
...
8652
GET HER THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
