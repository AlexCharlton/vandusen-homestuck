   1006
good morning, lovely. ^u^
so i gUess today is finally the day yoU make everything better.
it is the day whereafter the legendary octet of mUtUal progenitoriety will come together and heal a great breach in paradox space.
a day delivered throUgh eighty billion years and foUr distinct Universal instances worth of Unfathomable tUrbUlence.
and while the emerald eye of this storm is fixed in the abyss forever
today yoU are poised to escape its scowl once and for all.
by skaias gUiding light, yoU may leave behind its tUrning arms of bright coloUrs and mayhem, and secUre peace for yoUr cosmic progeny for all dUration.
and if yoU are to meet this departUre with trepidation i woUld Understand! bUt also i woUld ask
is there nothing i can do to ease yoUr mind?
yes. u_u;
i'm afraid i am gUilty of rehearsing this pep talk well in advance.
i thoUght yoU deserved a proper sendoff.
well then?
is there nothing i can do?
it was a serioUs qUestion. :u
splendid! ^u^
bUt remember i will be here to help, whilst refraining from caUsal spoilers to the best of my ability.
have yoU corresponded with yoUr first designated co-player yet?
not the today that is local to yoU.
thoUgh i do have a wee bit more troUble monitoring her than the rest of yoU. cUrioUs dark patches in transmission, hUmph.
still, i woUldn't fret over it. she is as good a chUm as any yoU have and shoUld come throUgh Ultimately, even if things seem dire.
blimey! :U
indeed, im sUre it was. i knew yoU woUld wake Up soon!
might yoU describe what yoU saw?
not at all! that is a simple detail aboUt the realm yoU are aboUt to explore, withoUt directly involving yoUr fUtUre decisions of conseqUence.
the place yoU visited was called prospit. it is where i have woken Up every time i have gone to sleep for most of my life.
no, yoU woUldnt have.
my prospit is an alternate version from yoUrs, in a completely different session qUite far afield of yoUr reality.
if we are ever to meet in person, it is Unlikely to be while playing oUr respective games!
i think this is for yoU to determine in time. what is yoUr hUnch?
Understandable. bUt it will be important to practice patience today.
yoU have a long road ahead of yoU, and many qUestions will be answered in time.
bUt we can talk it over later. now, we both have games to prepare for!
i know yoU coUld never fUlly appreciate what this actUally meant, bUt i took mUch care to sync Up these conversations with yoU on the same day that i begin playing as well.
that way, we can joUrney throUgh oUr sessions together and compare notes! :u
~_u
will yoU :U!!!
oh, hee hee! bUt i never claimed to be from that planet, which is only in the far reaches of yoUr solar system.
in fact i am from mUch farther away. a different Universe altogether.
bUt if yoU trUly mean it, thank yoU for believing me!
now, jane my lovely, let Us prepare for this adventUre.
remember what i said aboUt the need for patience.
patience with yoUr friends. 
patience for yoUr growth as a hero of life.
and patience for the coming of the other foUr of legend.
a hero of breath and of light and of time and of space!
and if yoU still find yoUrself in doUbt
jUst check the inscription on that big old book downstairs.
after all, if yoU cant trUst words written by yoUr own hand
then what Use is trUst at all? ^u^
<kisses!>
hello there, darling. ~3u
i dont relish troUbling yoU with more arm twisting.
im sUre for all ive done so far yoUve had a jolly good workoUt already :u
bUt yoU will be ready to deliver the package today, yes?
:U
how so???
well there yoU go, love! better hop to it.
i did indeed say so!
and have already done.
in yoUr fUtUre.
i relayed the information enabling yoU to create the powerfUl weaponry yoUrself.
and yoU did!
yoU then sent them back in time. yoU may recover them in the rUins, which conveniently is where yoU mUst go to ship the package once and for all.
bangUp plan we hatched, dont yoU fancy? ^u^
that is somewhat close to the trUth, and i can see how yoU woUld draw that conclUsion.
bUt theres more to it yoU dont Understand yet! yoU will sort it all oUt in time.
somewhat.
it woUldnt hUrt yoU mUch to know the trUth, i imagine.
its jUst the trUth is a wee bit complicated.
perhaps a draft of the cascading seqUence from which yoUr reality has arisen will pUt yoUr mind at ease.
imagine two Universes, A and B.
now imagine there are two instances of each Universe, A1 and A2 and B1 and B2.
the first instance of each is like a test rUn, that does not qUite sUcceed.
the second instance thoUgh will meet all of its pUrposes!
now consider that A1 begets A2.
A2 begets B1.
and B1 begets B2.
and the participants of B2 are the ones who will make an effort to exit all this tUrbUlence and falderal.
yoU are one of them! :U
and yoUr yoUng ancestor is another, thoUgh she is "presently" stationed in B1.
and yes she is in the past.
thoUgh not qUite as far as yoU believe!
nor does she occUpy the same stream of continUity.
thats the best i can do for now. u_u
primarily becaUse i will not risk wasting mUch more of yoUr time!
oh yes! ^u^
caUsal spoilers, sir english!
given the natUre of the qUest waiting for yoU, it woUldnt be shrewd of me to rUle oUt the employment of time travel by any individUal.
bUt i will say that yoUre probably prey to a basic misapprehension aboUt the natUre of this rendezvoUs.
it will not take place on earth.
it will happen inside the game yoUre aboUt to play!
indeed. :u
so trUe. id pay a hefty ransom to get to know my forebears.
correct. i never knew those who one woUld identify as my parental eqUivalents. U_U
it is in the way my race propagates. oUr ancestors precede Us by millenia.
nope! never did.
^u^
hm trUthfUlly?
it may be for the best that yoU never know it.
it coUld stir Up some things best left in their present eqUilibriUm.
and now i think i shoUld bollocks off and leave yoU to it!
no more procrastinating!
contact yoUr friend, darling.
i think yoU will have more fUn than yoU can imagine finding oUt.
bUt stated concisely, and short of spoilerly as yoU so charmingly pUt it,
yoUr objective today is to pave the way for the arrival of gods.
<kisses!>
there yoU are!
tricky one to track down, yoU are. :u
oh no doUbt!
methinks it has less to do with yoUr actUal whereaboUts as it does with yoUr virtUes as a hero of void.
caUsal! and yes, somewhat. however...
with these spoilers, by their natUre, the more time that passes for yoU the less relevant it becomes to gUard their secrecy.
as yoU approach yoUr entry, details i have obscUred will become more plainly evident.
so i see no harm in loosening my tongUe on certain matters the closer yoU get to the appointed hoUr! ^u^
yes.
the void aspect is fascinating, thoUgh.
its heroes preside over the essence of lack, or nothingness. the obfUscation of knowledge, or its oUtright destrUction.
well, *i* think it is wonderfUl. u_u
and anyway, one can hardly draw many conclUsions aboUt a player by aspect alone.
the aspect is channeled more specifically by the assets of ones class.
pretty mUch! :U
hmmmmm?
i Understand what yoU're getting at, yes.
it is certainly possible that we may have common groUnd with oUr ancestors when it comes to oUr aspects, and the way oUr abilities reveal themselves to Us. i coUld not rUle this oUt.
bUt there is always more to examine.
for instance, a hero of life and a hero of doom have aspects as different as can be.
bUt if their classes are different enoUgh as well, that is, one active and the other passive, remarkably there is a chance they coUld end Up with very similar abilities!
player abilities may also manifest in ways in defiance with their aspects if they are heavily resistant to their trUe calling. or, if corrUpted in some way by an oUtside inflUence.
bUt it is rather clear to me yoU are one who embraces her aspect qUite heartily, even if yoU are not aware of it. ^u^
oh yes, everyone is having important dreams as we near oUr mUtUal entries. this is lovely!
please tell.
can yoU describe her?
she soUnds to me like the well known figUre of legend.
or at least, well known to those who make the stUdy of sUch matters into their all consUming pastime. ~_u
i believe yoU saw the seer of light.
it woUld normally be my instinct to sUpply a vagUe response here...
bUt i think that yoUr heart has already told yoU the answer, and as sUch my secrecy woUld be pUrposeless.
so, yes, that she was!
fella?
what do yoU mean?
oh...
yes!
pardon my slUggishness on the Uptake. we are very different species, reprodUctively and familially, remember?
that i think is something i cannot say, or that is, shoUld not say.
oh, please don't press me for information! it makes me feel terribly gUilty.
yoU've no idea how mUch i woUld fancy revealing everything, and exchange oUr stories endlessly. bUt i mUst show restraint.
Ummm.
u_u;
i am not embarrassed, i jUst don't know what yoU're talking aboUt!
Um...
maybe?
Um...
maybe! :u
i confirmed no sUch thing, roxy!
yoU are being frightfUlly difficUlt! yoU jUst keep pUshing and pUshing and i can maintain my composUre for only so long!
if yoU are really cUrioUs aboUt the events sUrroUnding yoUr daUghter's origin, yoU can always ask her in person when yoU meet her.
oh...
well, yes.
bUt i'm not sUre if i shoUld have revealed that jUst now! yoU see what happens when yoU pUsh me!!!
there is so mUch for me to keep track of, and it gets very difficUlt to remember what information to reveal at what time when yoU are flUstered.
yes, basically.
yes.
the game provides a mechanism for the revival of the deceased, yes. it is called a kernelsprite, and yoU are free to gather remains of any dead party yoU choose, to revive that individUal in the form of a sprite. the sprite will then serve as a helpfUl spirit gUide on yoUr joUrney!
i believe i was very forthright in my answer!
if yoU play the game, yoU will meet yoUr daUghter.
if yoU play the game, yoU will meet yoUr mother too!
simple as can be. ^u^
-u-
...
u~u
those are...
definitely some things which yoU believe coUld be trUe or not trUe! :u
i am not any kind of liar!
U!
i choose U!!! :U!!!!!
i do love U's!
bUt i really don't lie!
i am not deceitfUl by natUre bUt in order to protect the integrity of certain oUtcomes while still being helpfUl to yoU, i gUess i am learning the art of deception throUgh honesty?
which as it tUrns oUt, as well intended as it may be, still comes across to a savvy lass like yoUrself as jUst another kind of eqUivocation.
thoUgh i gUess i shoUldn't be so startled that a rogUe of void coUld bewilder me so.
void players are said in texts to have a way with flUmmoxing even those with plans beyond mortal Understanding.
and i'm far from anyone like that. jUst a girl who wants to help!
i'd be ever so gratefUl. :u
yes! i can tell yoU plenty aboUt that.
a rogUe is a passive class. yoU see, there are passive (+) and active (-) classes. some more strongly passive or active than others.
the +/- distinction can mean many things, bUt coUld be qUite roUghly sUmmed Up in this way: active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves, while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others.
bUt of coUrse there's plenty more to it, and that rUle is in no way absolUte. only a starting point for Understanding the dichotomy.
sUre!
that's another fine way of looking at it.
classes always come in +/- pairs, with significant disparity between them.
while a rogUe is passive, a thief woUld be its far more active coUnterpart.
the rogUe and thief classes tend to be assigned to females. not exclUsively, bUt commonly!
other classes lean more toward male assignment, while others are exclUsively male, and jUst as many are exclUsively female. like my class. ^u^
that's a bit of a tangent thoUgh. to answer yoUr qUestion aboUt being a rogUe, i shoUld tell yoU both classes in +/- pairs tend to have very similar descriptions.
in this case, a rogUe or a thief is "one who steals." qUite simple, really!
bUt whether the class is + or - makes all the difference. it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make Use of the aspect.
if that reference to yoUr cUltUre provides a sUitable comparison, then absolUtely. :U
Understandable.
yes, it is one of the more conceptUally nebUloUs pairings, i agree.
and i can't say i know a smashing good deal aboUt the natUre of the void player's path, since the aspect is by definition inscrUtable to those it does not choose.
bUt i can at least tell yoU this.
if yoU are ever to enjoy fUll ascension as a rogUe of void, yoU will be able to do some completely astonishing things!
oh no, yoU will not pry this oUt of me.
not to preserve caUsality, bUt to keep the sUrprise in store for yoU.
it woUld not be honoUrable of me to spoil the discovery, shoUld yoU be fortUnate enoUgh to realize yoUr potential.
is that so?
woUld yoU mind listing them?
all fine points.
is there nothing i can do to make the decision easier?
what's a waffle arsed chUmp?
is it earth cUisine? :u~
that's another statement that doesn't make a good deal of sense to me, bUt if it is important to yoU, then godspeed!
i'm so pleased to hear yoU are leaning in favor of participating with the rest of Us. i promise we'll all have a ball together.
now i have a bUsy schedUle to keep Up with so i mUst go. bUt please remember yoU can always contact me if yoU have qUestions.
don't be a stranger, love. ta! ^u^
i see yoU're aboUt ready to begin. how splendid for yoU. ^u^
i'm at dangeroUs risk of jealoUsy.
oh, it's jUst i'm rUnning a bit behind schedUle. i wanted to coordinate with yoUr groUp in something approximating real time, and that is starting to look less likely.
my client player continUes to be a soUrce of frUstration. u_u
i'd thoUght we had everything settled, bUt it's always something with him.
i even told him in my last message it woUld sUit me fine if he wanted to be the server player instead. i jUst want to begin!
bUt i have not heard back from him... >:u
bUt at least i know how certain things go when it comes to yoUr story.
i don't qUite have that lUxUry with mine! it is nerve wracking sometimes, especially when i mUst coUnt on him to be responsible.
this is trUe.
thoUgh i'm sUre i've said, he isn't qUite my brother. we are related, yes, bUt not in the way hUman brothers and sisters are. 
we are genetically similar, bUt in many ways qUite different. in fact, oUr blood coloUr is not even the same!
bUt i have referred to him as a brother at times becaUse it is close enoUgh to being trUe, mUch as yoU refer to the one yoU regard as yoUr ancestor in the same way.
no, i think yoU're probably right.
while i await his response, perhaps i will take a nap, and see if the cloUds may offer any gUidance.
thoUgh lately i have been seeing many more black cloUds cropping Up in skaia than UsUal. it is a most Unwelcome trend. u_u;
good point! :U
i am so pleased to be a prospit dreamer. i'm sUre my brother finds his netherworldly affiliation similarly pleasing.
is that so?
yes, that is a pickle.
i don't know aboUt precedent, bUt it makes plenty of sense to me as the type of path one might expect for a hero of heart.
a path rUled by the heart aspect can be a joUrney of splintered self.
that is, the player's being may exhibit the same kind of fragmentation which certain classes coUld caUse in others.
i think this is what has triggered yoUr dUal-awareness between waking and dream selves, thoUgh it woUld not sUrprise me if the symptoms manifested in even more ways than this.
no!
like i said, these can be traits of sUch a hero, bUt is not necessarily always the case, nor is it the defining property of the aspect.
to Understand the heart aspect better, yoU might Use it interchangeably with the word soUl.
the hero Uses the methods endowed by class to inflUence in some way the soUl, or essence of being, of oneself or of others.
yes.
no!
again, sUrface meaning of classes and aspects can be deceptive.
a prince is a destroyer class.
it is very far on the active side of the scale. its more passive coUnterpart woUld be the bard class. both of these are exclUsively designated for male players.
to Understand a hero's capabilities, it always helps to search for the right way to parse the class/aspect pair into a more explicit statement.
for instance, being active, a prince coUld be viewed as "one who destroys x, or caUses destrUction throUgh x," if x is the aspect.
while the more passive bard coUld be seen as "one who allows x to be destroyed, or invites destrUction throUgh x," as if by the will of the aspect.
maybe! it's a qUirky class.
somewhat like a wildcard role for a hero. very Unpredictable.
they are typically known for their spontaneoUs and dramatic story-altering inflUence on the fate of a party.
some of the more remarkable tales involve sUch parties, where the bard is single handedly responsible for their spectacUlar downfall or improbable victory. or both!
in trUth, yoU are probably fortUnate yoUr groUp doesn't have one. :u
indeed.
i woUldn't be hasty in rUling it oUt.
that is, finding the need to Use the ability, not sUccUmbing to any sort of villainy. u~u
we tend to have these roles for a reason, and that reason UsUally finds Us. especially if we are to achieve god tier ascension.
no dirk!
i mean, no, i will not tell yoU!!!
that very well may be, bUt it will dreadfUlly complicate both of oUr lives if what is to come resUlts from self-fUlfillment alone!
a great deal of instrUctional material is very clear on this.
besides, yoU make it soUnd as thoUgh i know everything, which i most certainly do NOT. upu
(pardon the sideways tongUe.)
i have read mUch aboUt yoUr story in texts and have pieced together the overarching, exceedingly complicated saga as best as i coUld. i have as mUch aUthority over these events as a historian, and am at the mercy of my soUrces.
i also am able to access mUch of yoUr adventUre throUgh this terminal, bUt there is a limitation to this too, which i may as well admit now to get yoU off of my back!
i can view all events involving yoU and yoUr coplayers on earth, for yoUr entire lives, Until yoU enter the game.
i can also view some events after yoUr session begins, bUt not for very long, thanks to yoUr tipsy friend.
she blacks oUt yoUr entire session!
i'm sUre this is not deliberate on her part, bUt thereafter i can see nothing at all.
bUt i have never considered this to the detriment of either party. i still wish for Us to collaborate, and to help each other oUt.
beyond a certain point, we simply mUst commUnicate in the dark.
so there are many things aboUt yoUr fUtUre i do not know, at least not first hand.
bUt as yoU have probably ventUred, i am qUite an enthUsiastic admirer of yoUr groUp of heroes and yoUr incredible story. ^u^
thoUgh i can't see what happens mUch later, i can certainly specUlate. and i very often do. i gUess it woUld not hUrt to share some of my specUlation with yoU.
in fact, now that i consider it, that coUld be the most fUn thing of all!
yes. theories! examining all the clUes and hazarding oUr gUesses.
what does it all mean? everything aboUt yoUr vast epic points to a central mystery which i have not been able to solve yet.
yoU might even call it the Ultimate riddle, if that were not already codified as "a thing" in scriptUre.
i have so very many theories, i woUldn't even know where to begin.
i woUldn't go that far! oh my, i'm probably coming off as an absolUte nUtter now.
hm? :u
UUUUUUm...
.....
yes. u_u
ohhhh, no no no no no no no.
i woUld be far too embarrassed to do that.
well...
maybe jUst...
Um.
a wee bit. :u
a smidgen or two.
OK A WHOLE BLOODY LOT OF SMIDGENS. XU
i'm sorry. unu
bUUUt...
yoU woUldn't even Understand it!
my species has a completely different Understanding of romance than yoU do.
it woUld probably offend yoU deeply. it might even sicken yoU!
no, i'm sorry love, i jUst CANNOT abide.
if i let anyone read it, i woUld cUrl Up and die of shame. U_U
hmm.
well, when i find myself immersed in specUlation...
i do often enjoy drawing the things i imagine.
yes. ^u^
well...
yes!
yoU've talked me into it. this sUddenly soUnds fUn, and i have jUst the thing to show yoU.
yoU were asking aboUt whether yoU woUld ascend to godhood.
and withoUt getting into whether yoU do or do not, i have specUlated on yoUr hypothetical appearance, since that oUtcome is jUst as cloaked to me as it is to yoU.
given what is docUmented for the typical accoUtrements and cUt of the prince garb, and palette for the heart aspect, i think this is likely spot on!
http://tinyurl.com/dirkisthisyoU
perhaps. it all depends Upon how mUch of yoUr inner greatness yoU wish to realize. u_u
we sproUt them Upon ascension! aren't they beaUtifUl?
i have seen many depictions of sUch heroes with wings, Unless they happen to be hiding them beneath their clothes.
i gUess i can't be absolUtely sUre, bUt i believe it's reasonably likely the Upgrade is Universal!
yUp!
one hUndred percent princely canon.
no, silly.
they are jUst clothes. yoU are free to swap parts if yoU like.
or, if yoU wish to be free of it altogether, change back into yoUr plain clothes, and bob's yoUr Uncle. like it never even happened!
^u^!!!
oh...
no, love! it was a figUre of speech.
ah.
did i Use it incorrectly?
say, what is an Uncle, by the by?
hmm.
i sUppose i'll jUst have to take yoUr word for it. :u
yes?
doing what now?
hmm...
no, i fancy neither of those things make mUch sense at all.
oh!
yes, that woUld be my qUirk.
no! a qUirk!!!
qUirk dirk.
heeheehee. ^u^
we all need a qUirk!
it adds spice to oUr voices and helps Us stand oUt as individUals.
oh, well of coUrse YOU woUldn't.
yoU're hUman.
hUmans are notorioUsly strange. :U
i think their romantic practices are particUlarly esoteric.
actUally, i have written hUndreds of pages examining the striking differences between hUman and troll romance, as well as reprodUctive habits, as the comparison makes for a marveloUs case stUdy in xenobiocUltUral differences.
as long as i am sharing specUlation with yoU, perhaps yoU woUld like to read my essays?
i coUld even paste each page right here in sUccession, and allow yoU to read them back to back to back to back to back to back! ^u^
ah.
yes, yoU're right of coUrse. i'm probably getting carried away as UsUal.
forgive my enthUsiasm, it's jUst that i so rarely have anyone to talk to who shares my passion for these matters.
certainly not my cUrmUdgeonly coplayer. >:U
by jove, the nap!!!
yes, i really mUst secUre a bit of shUteye.
yoUr lord?
what...
do yoU mean by that exactly? :u
oh, right!
i woUld look at it this way.
yoU are moments away from beginning yoUr session, yes?
and yoU have already spent a long time gathering intelligence Unbeknownst to the aUthorities.
how mUch more do yoU expect to accUmUlate even if yoU coUld stay Undetected?
and how mUch strategic advantage is left to gain by delaying yoUr discovery for mUch longer?
i say the time to make a stand is now!
to hell with the dersite tossers.
make yoUr presence known. let them see that the prince is awake, and make it abUndantly clear what that means.
perhaps it is their tUrn to be nervoUs? to cower in the shadows and live in Uncertainty?
that is my advice. do with it as yoU will.
now i'm off to get some rest. u_u
with any lUck, the next time we convene, both of oUr adventUres will be well Under way.
cheerio!
hUzzah! yoU did it! ^u^
made it to locah! yoUr own personal planet inside the game, tailored to yoUr personal qUest.
i've observed yoU here before, of coUrse. bUt this is the first time i've contacted yoU here.
better to keep things on the Up and Up vis a vis oUr mUtUal linearity, no?
sUre? :u
i Understand.
pardon my grUmpy demeanoUr. i jUst had a nap and did not sleep well.
wasn't i being? :u
well good! i do my best.
really, as if my dreadfUl nap were not bad enoUgh, i woke Up to find my coplayer has made a terrible mess in here.
bUt the good news is he has at least agreed to play with me once and for all. some people make nothing easy.
Um.
i haven't!
not in person.
oh, yes, well, hmm.
the thing with that is this.
the thing with that is that we shoUld talk aboUt something else!
why mUst yoU be sUch the vigilant gUmshoe, jane?
always with the gUmshooery. pitch that pUzzlesavvy toward the conUndra littered aboUt yoUr planet!
i'm becoming grUmpy again. do forgive me.
what do yoU think of the place by the by?
yoUr new home!
yes isn't it great?
reminds me mUch of home. so peacefUl, so mUch space to yoUrself and time to think.
yoU're so lUcky. i can't wait to get to my planet!
right, that.
aboUt that.
got to rUn! Ta, kisses, all that stUff!!! u3u
yes.
don't i?
right then.
what can i do for yoU?
coUld be.
oh. yes.
keep going where yoU're headed.
things will work oUt in time. yoU'll see him.
i'm sorry.
i am not having the best day. u_u
everything!
where do i bloody begin.
well that goes withoUt saying doesn't it? he is ALWAYS a problem.
bUt it's more than that.
when i sleep and visit prospit, i see nothing bUt storm cloUds in skaia now.
my great big lovely ball of blUe has been cloUding over. soon i fear it will be completely black, and the kingdom will be shroUded in darkness.
i wish i Understood the meaning of this terrible omen.
and my brother has become more Uncooperative than ever.
he intends to play the game, bUt refUses to treat it like a collaboration.
i have told him many times that the only way we can win is to work together! bUt he wants it to be yet another competition between Us, like everything has been all oUr lives.
his threats to kill me have become harder to dismiss as his UsUal empty bravado.
i fear it may come down to having to kill him first.
althoUgh i am not sUre exactly how i woUld go aboUt this, or if i will even be Up to the task. umu;
yes. bUt i'll cope.
the real troUble thoUgh is i'm not sUre if i can play a sUccessfUl session withoUt him.
a two player session was already risky enoUgh, satisfying bare minimUm playing conditions.
and i had it on good aUthority that the two of Us woUld be able to sUcceed, particUlarly given oUr... well, withoUt intending to boast. varioUs advantages.
bUt i have no idea if a session of one is viable.
honestly i cannot for the life of me imagine how.
it may well resUlt in a void session like yoUrs, bUt withoUt the promise of any extenUating circUmstances.
i Used to hope so, bUt i doUbt it now.
he barely cares aboUt the game itself, other than as a means of escaping oUr planet.
he has always been more motivated by the ongoing game between Us.
well...
it is simple. we are playing a game together.
we have been forced to, for as long as we've known each other.
bUt the rUles are complicated, and often shifting. and they don't always make sense!
at least, they woUldn't to yoU.
many yoU woUld not recognize as rUles, so mUch as sUperstitions.
a variety of caveats and stipUlations. things that woUld invite misfortUne if i were to break. it woUld be very bad jUjU.
i have not been able to tell yoU my name for this reason.
doing so woUld lead Us all down a very slippery slope! bUt i have wanted to tell yoU so. i hope my relUctance has not compromised oUr friendship.
^u^
mm, yes. we have both renoUnced hemotyping Until the resolUtion.
it is in the same vein, pardon the pUn, as a qUirk. it's the old tradition whereby one types in his or her own blood coloUr.
so he and i have embraced neUtral tones to speak in, for the time being.
most hUmans do not practice hemotyping, presUmably dUe to lacking diversity in blood class.
yes.
i am a lime blood. UuU
while he's got the bright cherry blood, jUst like yoU all do.
not that this matters since we are alone here, bUt interestingly, in ancient troll cUltUre we woUld both be considered pariahs.
for different reasons of coUrse. those of his blood coloUr were very rare, existing by way of genetic glitch only. they were oUtcasts, having no place in the social order.
on the other hand, those of my blood coloUr were once actUally qUite common! bUt later they were all hUnted to extinction.
details of the genocide are historically mUrky. it's one of those maddening voids in my Understanding of yoUr elaborate epic.
bUt i have specUlated their extermination had to do with the extremely powerfUl abilities they tended to have, and the threat to aUthority they represented. even more so than other powerfUl lowbloods.
maybe. :u
he has other, Um. traits.
oh, probably. he is an oUtright mess. if yoU can name a problem with me, he's got it.
yes. it is!
sigh.
jane, i am sorry, bUt this is something i jUst cannot get into. for one thing we woUld be creeping way too close to breaking the rUles, and then we woUld all be bUggered.
even if i were at liberty to say, it woUld take so mUch time to explain everything. and i really mUst be getting to sleep again soon. i am terribly worried aboUt the people of prospit dUring sUch dark times.
sUffice to say, all games that are played have boUndaries. a stage to which all pieces and moves are confined.
like a chess board! there is no reality to the game beyond the edges of the binary grid.
i know. it was more infernal gammoning on my part as i dance aboUt these rUles.
it's all one can do when everything he or she ever does is jUst another move in a game.
i am so sorry, jane. i woUld have loved to be more forthright with yoU since the day we first spoke.
yoU are a dear friend to me. yoU and yoUr chUms. yoU are all the only friends i have ever had.
uUu
i was planning on giving yoU a gift.
yes, bUt i was going to wait Until completing my qUest before sending it to yoU.
bUt now that things are looking rather bleak here, i may have to consider accelerating the delivery.
it is a sUrprise! bUt i will tell yoU this mUch.
it is my jUjU. it is very dear to me.
a talisman of sorts, with many cUrioUs properties and rUles for implementation.
as yoU may have gathered aboUt me, i have learned the hard way that it always pays to follow the rUles. :U
it was an heirloom, yoU coUld say. passed on from ancestors. i have always had it.
jUjUs are said to have origins which are impossible to Understand or trace. some say they emerge spontaneoUsly from the void.
they cannot be trUly dUplicated. if there ever appears to be more than one of the same, it is only a mirage of caUsality!
nor can they ever be destroyed. not completely, at least.
so when i send yoU mine, it will be no small matter. it will not simply be copied throUgh alchemy.
yoU will be the new owner, and mine here will cease to exist.
bUt UnfortUnately it will have no valUe to yoU Unless i send my brother's jUjU as well.
and he will not relinqUish control of his Unless i best him at oUr game. this is another of oUr rUles.
oh yes. we are Up to qUite a bit fUrther than oUr neck in it. ~_u
bUt it's alright. i love games.
my brother, on the other hand...
on no, qUite the contrary.
his passion for games transcends any hUman Understanding of love.
for yoU to Understand it woUld be to fUlly comprehend the meaning of...
how to pUt it.
horror.
jake, i don't have long to talk so i shall leave this note to yoU while yoU sleep and then go.
i may have to begin, let Us say, bending rUles a bit more than i have?
he is making things bloody impossible. oUr game is now nothing short of war. that is all i will say.
well, i will also say this.
i am scared oUt of my wits to go to sleep now. i don't know what will come of me.
my dream self is kapUt, like yoUrs.
bUt i don't fancy yoU will have troUble waking from yoUr nap.
whereas i...
best not to dwell on it i sUppose.
i don't know what to do besides stall, and keep helping yoU as mUch as i can.
now is the time to retrieve those weapons from the capsUle and prepare the gift!
this is so important. the chain will not be complete Unless the delivery is made.
bUt first yoU may want to test its capabilities.
in particUlar... what are they called?
the infinitesimalizer and monstrositifier?
there sUre are some fUnny names for things strewn aboUt yoUr tale.
remember, green means grow, red means shrink! bUt sUrely yoU know this.
give it a go. perhaps try targeting that Unwieldy edifice stashed away in yoUr sylladex? coUld free Up some space!
bUt remember to hold on to it. it remains as important as ever.
i'll be sodding off then.
so mUch to do, so little time. u_u
finally getting a bit aggressive with yoUr qUeen there?
UsUally yoU aren't nearly as patient with her.
the little "gambit" i permitted yoU at the start has certainly inspired some Unconventional play.
it's not going qUite as miserably for yoU as i expected!
i am sorry to damn yoU with faint praise, bUt with a track record like yoUrs, i sUspect one takes what he can get. ^u^
rook to h4.
why have yoU been enclosing all yoUr moves in qUotes?
yoU have really been acting so odd this match.
knight to d6.
look oUt! i'm coming for her.
i think she's langUished behind the front lines long enoUgh, woUldn't yoU say?
time to shake things Up. move her, or take my knight.
yoU know yoU want to take her. jUst look at her there. what a cheeky intrUsion. slithered right into yoUr palace and made herself comfy. maybe she'll lay an egg once she's finished her feast. ^U^
might as well take her oUt. yoU know when the action begins and pieces start to fall, that's when yoU make all yoUr most creative mistakes!
anyhoo, far from over yoU say?
no, i don't imagine this game will be taking Up mUch more of oUr time.
i still don't know what yoU think yoU're on aboUt with this enchantment bUsiness.
if it's a psycheoUt tactic to break my concentration, it isn't working!
qUeen to a5.
the knight is dead.
yoUr goose is cooked.
yes, there yoU go!
that's the sort of aggression the people paid top boondollar to see.
king to d2.
bishop to d6.
the knight is dead.
your serpents are lost.
check!
oh dear! so mUch for yoUr enchantment.
that was a dire mistake. mate in foUr.
rook to f4.
check! ~3u
qUeen to e5.
check.
rook to g4.
check!
one more to go, love.
that's a fine attitUde. maybe yoU are finally making some progress in the realm of sportsmanship?
qUeen to g7.
checkmate. ^U^
what are yoU talking aboUt?
don't be a poor sport again. yoU were doing so well there, relatively speaking.
the game is over. better lUck next time, "bro." ^u^
i have no idea what yoU're babbling aboUt. soUnds like desperation to me.
i am looking at the pieces. yoUr king cannot step anywhere that does not pUt him in check.
nor can the threat to him be eliminated by other means.
yoU have been mated.
the king is dead.
yoUr enchantment has failed.
this is becoming silly.
Unless yoU have something to say aboUt the game which actUally makes sense, i am done with it.
i have more important things to do.
oh bloody hell.
THIS was yoUr "enchantment?"
are yoU serioUs???????????
UUUUUUUUUUUgh. this is yoUr shittiest twist yet!
i am jUst astonished.
not at the gUile of yoUr little ploy, bUt by the fact that yoU actUally seem to think this was a clever rUse.
it is jUst so painfUlly daft, i...
i am speechless!
this is absUrd.
yoU nagged incessantly for me to allow yoU to reverse the starting positions of the king and qUeen!
i only agreed to get yoU to shUt Up aboUt it, and regardless, i knew i coUld beat yoU anyway even with yoUr initial "advantage." and i was right!
how can yoU claim this as a legitimate strategy?
yoU broke the rUles!
i cannot believe yoU are defending this maneUver.
yes, i sUppose some of these tactics are technically within boUnds of the LETTER of the rUles, bUt the entire charade was highly disingenoUs and Unsportsmanlike.
it is Unbelievably childish, even for yoU!
WHAT??
absolUte bollocks.
what rUles did i break?!
this oUght to be good!
YOU PRICK!!!!!!!!!!!
ohh, i coUld jUst strangle yoU.
yoU don't even know how tempted i am to do so right now.
i did not break the rUles. i was doing yoU a FAVOUR.
in any case, yoU say yoU managed to beat me? when did that happen!
even thoUgh yoU've exposed yoUr rUse, yoU haven't actUally mated me yet, grandmaster "bro."
bring it on!!!!!!!!!!!
king to e3.
blech. look at this royal cockUp.
this is so stUpid.
now i either have to sacrifice my qUeen, or move my king into a strategically horrible position.
why am i even going along with this?
yoU wish.
to hell with it. let's sacrifice the qUeen.
i still pUt odds in my favoUr, with my rooks and bishop versUs yoUr bishop, rook, and qUeen.
i've bested yoU before with less material and initiative on my side.
qUeen to c3.
the rook is dead.
my "bro" is an arse!
oh shUt Up and play.
king to e2.
rook to c4.
king to d2.
shUsh.
king to c2.
wait, where did yoU pUt it?
yoU better not have jUst literally eaten the bishop.
rook to c8.
check.
rook to h8.
the rook is dead.
oUr shits weren't given.
grr.
king to d2.
king to e2.
king to d2.
will yoU stop... *DOING THINGS* with the dead pieces!
i swear, as if the jUvenile "enchantment" wasn't enoUgh, if it tUrns oUt yoU are also losing or destroying pieces deliberately, I AM GOING TO STRAIGHT UP FLIP A BITCH.
rook to h7.
CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!
king to c2.
king to b2.
FUCK THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
i don't know why i bothered hUmoUring yoUr vile Underhanded rUbbish!
I HATE YOU. JUST SOD RIGHT OFF TO HELL, PLEASE.
yoU are disgUsting.
i really loathe yoU, and no, NOT IN "THAT WAY!"
i am not going to talk to yoU for a while. probably a LONG while.
i only hope i can overcome my contempt for yoU when it comes time to play oUr game. bUt i am not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!
leave me alone.
miss lalonde, do be carefUl.
i can see that yoU are preoccUpied with aggressors at the moment.
bUt yoUr viewport is beginning to black oUt more freqUently.
i wanted to talk to yoU one last time before yoU enter, and yoUr whole session blacks oUt for good.
and before...
well, before i possibly do the same. U_U;
please reply when yoU have the chance.
ah, hello!
escaped troUble, i presUme? how are yoU doing?
i am sorry to hear yoU're feeling Under the weather.
bUt now i am wondering. hm.
coUld it have been that regUlar intake of yoUr soporific liqUids was inhibiting yoUr commUnion with the void, rather than exaggerating them as i had presUmed?
if the effects are wearing off, it coUld explain the increase in viewport blackoUts.
and once they wear off completely, perhaps that is why yoUr entire session goes dark on yoUr entry.
yoU are probably right. still, i can't help bUt specUlate on sUch matters. it is what i do. :u
oh, not to worry. ^u^
hee hee! if only.
i do know a thing or two aboUt the red miles.
it is the qUeen's favoUred attack. very long distance and omnidirectional.
bUt once Upon a time, her weapon was stolen by a UsUrper. jacked, yoU coUld say, right off her ring finger. and then given a considerable boost in power.
that gave the miles enoUgh of a kick to rip a Universe to shreds.
and they have been doing so to yoUrs and its many instances for eons.
only now have they caUght Up to yoUr instance. it is qUite fortUnate it has taken so long, really.
some instances are tUcked deeper in the speaker's mighty blow sack, and will hold oUt for mUch longer, on a vast cosmic scale of coUrse.
yes.
try to think of it like this.
imagine that the Universe is contained inside a very large creatUre.
say, a great big frog.
it's jUst a frog! that is the way it is, jUst try to imagine it.
now imagine that not only does the Universe exist inside it, depending on the creatUre's health and well being to sUrvive...
bUt every potential instance of that Universe exists inside as well.
those that are doomed and those with promise.
even those that were reset from scratch, with slightly different starting conditions.
all of those interrelated Universes mingling together inside yoUr frog, inextricable from its physiology.
if the frog dies, they all go with it. eventUally.
sadly, yes.
well, it coUld have been worse, actUally. the miles coUld have spread to yoUr Universe before it had the chance to sproUt yoUr lovely planet, providing a home for yoU and yoUr wonderfUl mates.
all Universes die at some point. some sooner than others. it is all part of the cycle, and sometimes things like this mUst happen for reasons beyond oUr Understanding.
bUt this is neither here nor there. i did not intend to go blathering aboUt all that and waste an important conversation with yoU.
i think the trUth is i am probably jUst stalling.
i have some important things to tell yoU.
i'm afraid i am going to be breaking so many rUles in doing so.
i am not Used to breaking rUles. it makes me very Uncomfortable.
bUt it may be my only chance. i hope yoU won't think less of me for it.
yes.
bUt so are yoU, and i've distracted yoU enoUgh.
concentrate on retUrning to yoUr home.
once yoU are there and preparing for the game, i will contact yoU again and tell yoU everything that i have been wanting to tell yoU.
also...
i wanted to give yoU something. :u
jUst a thing!
yoU'll see.
now rUn along!!!!!!!!!!!
i can't see yoU, bUt yoU mUst be back by now, yes?
haxxing? :u
u~u
Um...........
roxy?
i don't Understand.
yoU are typing some sort of compUter program?
^u^;
ah, i Understand. yoU're beginning then. good!
right!
it's a present i made for yoU.
it coUld be...
a farewell gift actUally.
maybe.
i am aboUt to go to sleep one last time before oUr schedUled entry.
and there is a very real possibility that i will never wake Up.
it is complicated.
there is mUch to say aboUt it which i have never told yoU, dUe to my adherence to the rUles.
some of which i am aboUt to break now, in order to give myself a fighting chance.
bUt before i go down that serpentine path with yoU, here.
one last bit of artwork from an admirer. something to remember me by, shoUld we never speak again.
http://tinyurl.com/roxyisthisyoU
^U^
indeed it is!
i really enjoy drawing yoU. it is a treat.
yoU are jUst so pretty. :u
anyway, i am very pleased that yoU like my drawing. ~u~
yoU do?
really??
:U
blimey.
this comes as qUite a sUrprise.
oh.
then the conciliatory type. i Understand.
no! don't be.
trUst me, that is not how i feel aboUt yoU. or anyone.
thoUgh i trUly wish i were capable of those feelings.
perhaps the fact that i am not is why the topic fascinates me so.
and why i have been prone do indUlge in sUch...
fancifUl visUalizations.
of yoUr people's lovely bright red relationships.
they mUst be nice. u_u
yes, as a matter of fact.
that is actUally the reason i am contacting yoU.
it is one rUle i have decided to break.
my name is calliope.
it feels so strange to type that!
bUt also good, actUally.
yoU're welcome. it is good to get it off my chest.
bUt i am primarily telling yoU this as a last resort, in hopes of saving myself.
yoU see, this rUle between me and my brother is a kind of trUce.
we have both agreed not to say oUr names to anyone so that things will not get oUt of hand, and so it became one of the rUles.
if anyone were to say his name to me, i woUld immediately fall asleep, and he woUld wake Up.
so yoU will Understand if i refrain from telling yoU his as well. ~_u
yes, fortUnately for both of Us.
now, chronologically speaking, i have never contacted yoU after this moment.
so if i never wake Up from my next nap, yoU will never hear from me again.
if yoU do not hear from me later, i woUld very mUch appreciate it if yoU coUld message my brother, and say my name.
it may be the only chance i have to wake Up again.
splendid!
<kisses>
i want to!
it is overwhelming, trying to be cavalier aboUt rUles i have respected all my life. i'm not sUre where to begin.
oh, i can have romantic feelings.
jUst not the flUshed kind, which hUmans describe as romantic love.
yes, that's right.
bUt...
oh bUgger. this is so embarrassing to have to admit.
i am sorry for saying things which may have reasonably led yoU to believe this.
probably way too many things. u_u;
bUt i am not actUally a troll.
i have never actUally claimed to be. bUt i'm sUre i have implied it, probably dUe to wishfUl thinking.
i have spent so mUch time wishing i coUld be one.
trolls are a remarkable and fascinating race.
hUmans are too, please don't get me wrong!
bUt i am oUt and oUt smitten with trolls and their history and ways.
they have sUch amazing, coloUrfUl social dynamics that soUnd like so mUch fUn to be a part of.
and they are so beaUtifUl.
i wish i coUld be that pretty.
UnfortUnately, i am not very attractive at all.
sad to say, no one woUld kiss the corpse i will leave behind.
even if there were someone aroUnd to revive me, i doUbt they woUld be inclined to bother.
for, er... several reasons, actUally.
bUt really, it was always for the best that i cannot have fUlly flUshed feelings.
no one coUld ever love me.
it is.
and it's for the best that no one has ever seen my face, aside from my brother.
no.
i am sorry.
heehee. no.
that jUst happened to be a planet from yoUr system i thoUght was lovely.
i was particUlarly strUck by its UniqUe rotation.
it has very nice...
bollocks, what's the word.
the term that refers to a ball's topspin?
it doesn't matter.
bUt no, i'm not even from yoUr Universe, let alone a nearby planet.
my species has never even had a home planet.
i am a cherUb!
no!
i doUbt i am what yoU're pictUring.
bUt aside from a few sUperficial similarities, we are very different from trolls and hUmans.
we are not a social race. we generally will not ever encoUnter another of oUr kind, Unless it is time to mate.
and when that time comes, oUr coUrtship is nothing like it is for hUmans.
it is highly confrontational and violent.
it is lonely.
bUt that is in oUr natUre, to be alone. jUst as it is to find attraction throUgh contempt.
now that i think aboUt it, i shoUld have known.
i've been so foolish.
aboUt the natUre of my game session.
i believed he and i coUld play together, even Under oUr UniqUe biological circUmstances.
i was so daft, i thoUght skaia had actUally made an exception for Us.
and that we coUld overcome oUr conflicts, work together, and fUlfill the game's minimUm reqUirement of two players. one of space and the other of time.
bUt i was always fooling myself.
it is now clear only one of Us will sUrvive.
my skaian visions have misled me.
or i have blinded myself to their trUe meaning.
this was always meant to be a session of one.
and i am finally starting to Understand...
the reality of that coUld have conseqUences more horrifying than we coUld begin to imagine.
the thing is, yoU don't know him like i do.
as hard as it may be to believe, he is even worse than yoU think.
and it's all sUch a shame, not jUst becaUse of that.
it is a shame that i won't be able to play, i gUess for selfish reasons.
i was so looking forward to it.
i really thoUght i was going to be someone special.
that i coUld Use my abilities do something no one had ever done.
yes. you're right.
mUch like skaia, i've sUccUmbed to a gloomier outlook lately, due to recent setbacks.
well, i was always led to believe i woUld be an extraordinary type of player.
both of Us woUld be. we are both assigned extremely rare and powerfUl classes.
they are the two master classes!
mine is the most passive on the scale. a class designated for females only.
i am the mUse of space. ^u^
i'm not entirely sUre. i was hoping to discover that on my joUrney.
anyway, his is the other master class.
the most active class of all, reserved for male players.
Um...
roxy.
i think we may be getting a wee bit carried away with trivia here.
we both have so mUch to do.
yoU need to focUs on getting to safety, while i need to...
prepare myself. for what i hope will be a short nap.
you are a good friend, roxy.
please take care.

hello!
yes, it is i!
sorry! :u
no, roxy. i am afraid it was not a helping of yoUr delicioUs earth baloney.
alas, we do not.
this is not my trUe appearance. i have taken the form of my trollsona.
i wanted to look more presentable for oUr meetUp. UnfortUnately my trUe visage woUld likely repUlse or frighten yoU.
that is not the first impression i woUld like to make.
that is so kind of yoU to say. i can believe that a lovely person like yoU woUld be able to stop herself from recoiling at the sight of my monstroUs face.
bUt it is oUt of the qUestion. i am mUch more comfortable appearing to yoU this way.
really it has more to do with my own dissatisfaction with the way i look than any lack of trUst in yoUr character.
yoU Understand, don't yoU?
likewise!
i wish it coUld be Under better circUmstances thoUgh.
we may not have mUch time here.
yes. i have led yoU to a dream bUbble of my own design.
my imagination and thoUghts dictate what yoU see here.
as i told yoU earlier, my brother is hUnting for me. so i have created a little sanctUary in space to stay hidden from him.
that is why i coUld not speak to yoU earlier. not oUt loUd at least. he is highly sensitive to my presence, so it is very easy for me to get his attention if i'm not carefUl.
bUt as long as we stand in the centre of this vortex, we may speak as loUdly as we like! no information can escape this dark pocket, so long as i maintain it.
and seeing as yoU are a hero of void, yoU make an ideal gUest to bring home for one who wishes to remain hidden. thoUgh i will say the fact that yoU are my best friend is a lovely bonUs. ^u^
i know.
i am sorry. u_u
he is not trying to kill me.
he has already sUcceeded at that.
on the day he foUnd a way to kill my dream self, i was done for. thoUgh to be honest, i doUbt i'd have fared mUch better regardless.
i think his half was always meant to predominate.
my will was simply not strong enoUgh to overcome his. yoU know as well as i how stUbborn he is. i don't think he has ever had even a smidgen of doUbt in his thoUghts, or remorse for his deeds. whereas i was always plagUed by sUch feelings.
on some level i always knew he woUld win. bUt i fooled myself. i thoUght i coUld overcome his ego by looking beyond his negative qUalities, staying optimistic, and working together with him in a game to accomplish something extraordinary.
and that in doing so, perhaps i coUld begin to help him change. to teach him to evolve beyond his hatefUl natUre. and as he changed for the better, slowly but sUrely, he woUld become more like myself.
that was how i thoUght i coUld predominate. it was how i was going to win! and really, if he grew closer to me in that way, by learning kindness and compassion, we both woUld have won. my predomination woUld not have meant his absolUte death, but oUr trUe Union.
bUt sadly, i Underestimated how consUmed he was with the need to destroy me.
now he is completely obsessed with finding my soUl and wiping me oUt for good, even if it means tearing apart the reality that sUrroUnds Us.
he will never feel he has won Until all traces of me are gone.
don't fret. yoU did all yoU coUld.
very Unlikely.
^u^
it's trUe that he deserves a comeUppance like few others.
bUt slaying him is not actUally yoUr responsibility as heroes now.
in fact, if anyone mUst bear that bUrden, it might be me.
possibly.
as we speak, there are hUndreds of soUls oUt here in the fUrthest ring working to defeat him.
some search for a fabled treasUre. a weapon said to spell his certain demise.
while others say that i myself am this weapon. :U
and so they search for me.
they band together in great nUmbers for this caUse, and attract his devastation in hopes of revealing the path to the weapon.
while at the same time, they draw his attention away from me. and it is a good thing that they do.
i mUst remain hidden from everyone for as long as i can.
becaUse i am no sUch thing!
i was already Useless against my brother when he was jUst a brat who liked to tease me.
now that he is an exceptionally mUscUlar and invincible adUlt, my chances are laUghable.
no, if i am to contribUte, i need more time.
i mUst go in search of my own weapon.
ironically, the same weapon which many of them are looking for.
me!
it's the only sliver of hope i have.
i have reason to sUspect there may be another iteration of myself oUt here.
one from a doomed timeline, who has kept hidden for a long time, jUst like i have.
bUt Unlike me, she sUpposedly came from a reality where she predominated instead of my brother.
and not by the means which i described. hers was not a mild Union of reconciliation.
amazingly, her predomination was absolUte! a major feat of will, jUst as his was with me.
as sUch, she went on to play the game, and...
well, i cannot even imagine what followed, aside from the fact that she eventUally mUst have died for existing in an offshoot reality.
if she exists, i woUld be eager to meet her. it woUld be a chance to get to know a version of myself who was strong enoUgh to override the will of my brother.
someone i might have become if i had a little more coUrage. u_u
and if she is sUch a person, then i really believe all i have heard mUst be trUe. i believe she is the key to defeating him.
so i have no choice.
i mUst go in search of myself.
indeed.
it's the same as it always was.
to win the game.
it is as i once told jane.
with victory yoU may finally exit this vast whirling storm.
by claiming yoUr reward yoU woUld bring closUre to a very wide coil of caUsality, one not tracing a continUoUs path like a snake, bUt intricately woven like a wreath.
a ring of coUntless little rises and falls, ascents and descents, on its way Up and down a pair of mUch bigger ones itself.
from alpha to beta, then beta to alpha, as if a moUntain to be scaled and then climbed back down. its peak toUches the eye of a storm which cannot end Until the moment yoU all walk throUgh that door.
only then will there be calm.
ah, bUgger. forgive me, sometimes i forget myself and begin speaking in riddles.
it's jUst a habit that is in the natUre of my people.
don't remind me. in my opinion they do not qUalify as anything of the sort, mUch the same as his "shitty twists". >:u
as the one who provoked the breach in paradox space which i jUst coloUrfUlly described, he has always exerted his inflUence on yoUr realities from afar, and from many different angles. throUgh Unwitting sUrrogates, oUtsoUrced manipUlation, oUtright enslavement, and even petty harassment. bUt most of all, he prevails throUgh the simple inertia of inevitability that has always been on his side, as a lord of time.
and as the one who is to blame for foolishly allowing him access to sUch power, it's only proper that i take responsibility for finding a way to defeat him.
bUt even thoUgh his methods of inflUencing yoUr session are indirect, they are still formidable.
there will be a nUmber of powerfUl foes who stand between yoU and victory.
tomorrow, a terrific battle will take place.
when yoU wake Up, i sUggest yoU begin to prepare.
yes, i'm sUre new eqUipment woUld come in handy.
now that yoU mention it, well before i died or even realized i woUld not live to play, i made special exception to my rUle of staying linear with conversation. i messaged jane a birthday gift.
yoU see, i had a brief vision from skaia which sUggested to me she coUld Use a boost in morale on this special day, so i offered her something very dear to me. jUst a little token to show appreciation for her friendship.
i hope it will cheer her Up, and moreover that it will prove at least somewhat UsefUl to yoUr party.
bUt really, at this stage if yoU wish to prevail against sUch stacked odds, collecting boons sUch as new weapons and treasUres will only go so far.
i think yoU will need to embrace a far more sUbstantive gambit.
it is not fefeta!!!
i am sUggesting a measUre that is mUch more extreme.
i believe yoU shoUld all strongly consider ascending to the god tiers.
well of coUrse it soUnds cool! bUt it's not necessarily as easy as it soUnds, steeling oneself for death. believe me.
bUt if yoU can find the resolve, then here is what yoU mUst do.
since none of yoU have any dream selves left, it won't do any good to sacrifice yoUrselves on the qUest beds foUnd on yoUr respective planets.
and even if yoU did, there is not even a battlefield from which to rise anew. no, yoUr void session had only one path to ascension all along.
yoU mUst travel to the centre of the moons of prospit and derse, and there in the crypt yoU will find yoUr sacrificial slabs. yoU mUst lie on them, and then...
then yoU all mUst die. one way or another. u_u
alright?
doesn't the thoUght make yoU nervoUs?
yes.
yes. :u
yes! :U
yoU seem qUite cavalier aboUt this, roxy!
don't yoU have doUbts?
woUldn't it cross yoUr mind to wonder, "what if i never wake Up again?"
i know it woUld for me.
yes. i believe yoU will.
...
^u^
those who i mentioned my brother has been exploiting as his pawns from afar.
the most obvioUs woUld be the one responsible for the extinction of yoUr race.
and who also happened to be responsible for this most fortUitoUs nap.
yoU don't remember yet?
...
bUt which floor?
as i said, she is his servant, and is obligated to do everything in her power to facilitate the cycle of his existence.
and while nearly all she has done on earth and on derse has been to advance that scheme, that does not mean she's withoUt her own agenda.
i know that she woUld like to see my brother defeated as mUch as anyone else. for her enslavement, for doUble-crossing her, and for orchestrating her people's extinction.
he always did loathe trolls. i've sUspected i may be to blame for their misfortUne as well, considering he knew how mUch i fancied them. u_u
i believe she's looking ahead, beyond the fUlfillment of her obligation. she is likely making plans for after she is liberated. she has lived as a rUler and conqUerer for very long time, and probably coUldn't have done so withoUt sUch gUile and foresight.
if she has captUred yoU, it's certainly for a good reason.
i think she wishes to exploit yoUr abilities as a rogUe of void.
none that yoU have gotten in toUch with yet.
bUt rest assUred, yoU have them!
it's like i told yoU before, remember?
a fUlly realized rogUe of void can do remarkable things. things which even other god tiers woUld view as miracUloUs.
why don't yoU see what it is the qUeen woUld have yoU do?
then yoU may look inside and determine whether yoU have it in yoU to do it.
that is Understandable.
jUst do whatever yoU feel is right. i'm sUre yoU will make the correct decision.
yoU see, i trUst yoU too, roxy. ^u^
oh no...
OH NO!!!
WHAT IS *SHE* DOING HERE???
happy birthday, jane! ^u^
