Why Is It That When The Subject Of Temporal Mechanics Is Broached Your Sparing Human Intellects Instantly Assume The Most Ingratiating Posture Of Surrender Imaginable
Time Is Not That Difficult To Understand
It Is A Utility That A Universe May Resort To In Order To Advance A Desired Degree Of Complexity
Or May Not Resort To If That Is The Case
Its All Pretty Pedestrian
But No 
When Time Travel Comes Up You Present The Face That A Man Shows When The Breeze Gradually Alerts Him To His Absence Of Netherdressings
I Dont See How We Are To Properly Agitate You All If You Continue To Insist On Failing To Understand Basic Concepts Which Common Infants Effortlessly Manage To Describe Via Scrawlings In Their Own Puddles Of Sloppy Discharge
Yes 
In The Future
Oh My It Is Your Human Sarcasm Again
I Enjoy Listening To It And I Wish Doing So Could Serve As My Primary Form Of Recreation
There See I Just Did It Too
Saying The Opposite Thing To Emphasize My Contempt
But Suddenly I Feel More Primitive And Hate Myself A Little More
It Was Like This Funny Miracle That Just Happened In My Heart
Oh Dear
No We Arent From "The Future"
But We Are All Already In Agreement That You Dont Get It And Never Will
We Did
Your Future
For Me It Was Only A Couple Minutes Ago
Yes Thats Right
Will You Try To Talk Some Sense Into Your Idiot Friends
So That We May Proceed To Bother Them All On More Rational Terms
I Will Admit This Campaign Of Provocation Wasnt All That Well Thought Out
Dont Tell Anyone I Said That
Yeah Maybe
Why Dont We Be Friends
I Think So
I Think Were Supposed To
You Suggested As Much Earlier
Yes A Couple Minutes Ago
Thats Likely
You Command The Seer
So You May Have Some Insight Into Her Disposition
The One Who Is A Little Snooty 
Thats An Exotic Title
I Thought You Were The Knight
Have You Found Her Demeanor To Be Chilly
On A Basis Of Personal Interaction That Hypothetically Extends Beyond The Context Of A Short Lived And Lackluster Trolling Effort
I Thought Your Familiarity With Her May Allow You To Furnish Me Insight
She And You Are Familiar Isnt That Right
She Perhaps Even Regards You With Uh
Endearment
Um Is This
A Common Sort Of Practice In Human Courtship
Watching Oblong Meat Products Tumble Into Places They Dont Belong
Am I Being Accused Of Falling Prey To The Human Dysfunction Of Amorous Inclination
I Just Would Like To Gather
Some Means Of Gauging Her Sincerity
Maddening
How Do Humans Forge Meaningful Relationships Using Such Communication Patterns
Perhaps It Is The Human Riddle That Is Truly The Ultimate Riddle
It Was Not A Sincere Remark
I Have Been Practicing
Your Human Sarcasm
Very Well
I Am Beginning To Feel As Though I Am The Only One Working On Our Friendship
That Was Sincerity
Then
Keep Saying The Opposite Things
It Sounds Like
You Are Advising Me To Troll Her Again
Which I Have Tried
It Proved To Be A Fruitless Endeavor
Okay
I Believe I Understand How To Proceed
Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You
I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism
What Do You Think About This
Ah See It Is Working Already
Ive Listened To His Advice
And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly
I Know What I Have To Do
What We Have To Do Really
Remember The First Time We Spoke
The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You
This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You
Thats Next Time
Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply
4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6
Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible
But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That
See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe
Yes
That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now
I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log
Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed
I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant
But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It
So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless
!
Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place
Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression
!!!
Yes
Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me
Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit
The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw
Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development
By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground
In Successive Conversations
4=3 And 5=4 And Such
Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation
But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now
They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation
Yes
It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities
I Dont Understand
Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time
I'm Hopping To 8=8
Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought
Im Supposed To Antagonize A Few Members Of Your Trivial Species
I Have To Start Somewhere
And Somewhen
So I Am Starting With You
And Now
Its Going To Be Pointless And Unpleasant
Mostly For Me
Actually You Know What
Im Not Really Feeling This At All
Goodbye
Is This
Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About
That You Always Use
And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate
I Thought That Was The Thing You Did
The Rose Human Specifically
Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements
Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful
Have We Spoken Before
Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation
I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest
It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things
Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To
He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is
Uh Okay
Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This
I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now
Maybe
When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him
Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart
And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics
I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here
Kind Of Irritating
Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades
This John Human
And Figure Out Whats Going On
Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.
Until Next Time Rose
Next Time In The Past
If Youre Not Too Busy Still Setting Up The Network
Perhaps You Could Come Show Me How To Activate The Viewport
My Keyboard Is Missing The F1 Key
You Used To Like To Talk More
If I Recall I Was Typically The One Who Would Solicit Reprieves From Your Nonsense
So I Dont Know What Happened
Then Why Are You Doing This
Setting Up These Stations For Us
I Did Fiddle With It
To No Avail
Hello Again
Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time
I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be
Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time
The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose
It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time
Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting
Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That
Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She
Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema
I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying Scenario
I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything
What Are You Talking About
I Believe I Understand
It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous Conversation
One Which I Have Not Had Yet
Fine
Hi Again Aradia
So I Guess Tonight Is The Night You Blow Everything Up
Is There Nothing I Can Do To Change Your Mind
Yeah I Guess Not
I Thought Id Be Friendly Though
And Remind You That You Do In Fact Have A Hand In All The Terrible Things That Are About To Happen
Because Thats What Friends Are For
And The Fact That What Ensues Will Be Terrible
Is An Immutable Fact I Am Stating For The Record
And The Fact That We Will Not Be On The Same Team Is Similarly Immutable
It Does Not Mean That Teamwork Is What Isnt Taking Place Here
Ill Be Here To Help
If You Need Me
Just Wanted To Know
Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
Uh No
You Sure Do Seem To Be Saying Cahoots
Im Just Asking
Because Mines Dead
It Was Just Her Time
No There Was No Plot Or Conspiracy Or Any Trace Of Saboteurs Operating Through The Special And Magical Union One Can Only Describe As Being In Cahoots With Another
When A Virgin Mother Grub Abdicates And Renounces Brooding
Her Time Will Be Relatively Short
I Always Knew This
Maybe You Still Can
They Are All Dying
Or Are Going To Soon
I Believe Its A Preemptive Consequence Of The Game We Are About To Play
If A Preemptive Consequence Is A Concept That Can Be Said To Hold Any Meaning
But From What I Understand If It Is Applicable In Any Sphere At All Then This Game Holds That Sphere
I Wasnt Going To Think That
You Know What I Dont Think Even I Really Understand What I Just Said So Nevermind
Yes A Few
Karkat Thinks Its His Fault
He Believes His Actions Triggered An Inauspicious Chain Reaction
Sure
Im Not Surprised To See You Endorse His Paranoia Without Hesitation
But I Was Attempting To Illustrate A Point In Bringing It Up
These Events Are Inevitable And Regardless Of Whatever Emotional Entanglements Obfuscate Their Significance They Will Ultimately Serve An Important Purpose
The Curse Had Nothing To Do With It
And Karkats Notion Of A Curse Is Inseparable From His Perception Of Events As Intrinsically Negative And As Tailored To His Personal Dissatisfaction
And Your Bad Luck Is The Same Way
I Believe Anyway
What Would Happen If You Just Cleaned Up A Bit
Dont You Think You Would Step On A Few Less Hard Triangles
Because Youre Dangerous
Every Time You Tell Me To Can It I Think Its Funny
I Mean Its Just A Funny Thing To Say Dont You Think
Its Ok To Be Dangerous
Lots Of People Are
And Dangerous People Can Be Really Important
Maybe Even The Most Important Sometimes
But It Just Means Theres Got To Be Someone Around To Keep An Eye On Them
And If Not Me Then Who
Everyone Has An Important Job To Do
That Wouldnt Work
If I Tried To Stop You You Would Regard Me As An Enemy
Instead Of Merely As A Nuisance
And What Good Would That Do
So Im Afraid Mcfussyfangs It Must Be
Youre Right Anything Can Happen I Guess
But Just So You Know Im Sorry For Your Loss In Advance
Hey
You Seem More Excited Than Usual
Or Less
I Cant Tell
Help Me Tell Without Saying Glub
Im Going To Type This Face Now
:?
Even Though No One Knows How To Make A Mouth Do A Question Shape Like That
Yes You Can
But Thats Fine You Can Glub To The Content Of Your Collapsing And Expanding Bladder Based Aquatic Vascular System
If It Means You Are Excited About Something
Ok Why
It Looks Like One Of Your Letters Got Away From You
You Forked An Innocent D Loitering Over There By The Shout Pole Minding Its Own Business
Yeah Sure
I Thought So
I Have Been Cloaked In A Mood Of Perpetual Anticipation For Some Time As Well
Well
Not Really
What Notes Would You Like To Submit For Comparison
Yeah
I Dont Know For A Fact That She Is Mine
I Know
But What If I Dont Really Want Her To Be That
Yeah Glub Glub Shrug Is The Right Attitude I Think
Our Minds Are Already Made Up Anyway Arent They
They Dont Tell Me Everything
Just As I Am Sure She Doesnt Whisper Everything To You
I Wonder If Any Other Kid On The Planet Has As Many Burdens In The Fire As You
I Doubt It
Just Wanted To Know
Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
Who
Overstating Our Relationship Wont Make Me Feel Very Cooperative
Its Paler Red Than That Ok
Why Do I Got To
I Dont Got To And Every Time You Take My Help For Granted I Feel Like I Got To A Little Less
If Your Slander Werent So Predictable Id Block You Too For Saying That
Has It Occurred To You She May Have Blocked You Because You Are Vvery Ovverbearing
I Just Said That Aloud Now In Your Silly Accent And Had A Private Moment Of Enjoyment
Your Black Solicitation Just Seems Really Indecent
What Do You Want From Her Anyway
What Is It
Can You Just For A Moment Entertain The Thoughts Of One Untouched By Megalomaniacal Derangement And Tell Me Why Id Want To Assist You With That
Also Speculate For A Moment That Self Preservation Might Not Be What Would Sway My Decision
Its Just
Laborious Listening To This
Im Sorry
None Of It Matters
I Know
But You Really Should Know By Now The World Will End Tonight Regardless
Land And Sea Dwellers Alike Will All Die
Because Of The Game We Are About To Play
And I Agree The Fate Of The Race Is Important But Its In My Hands Now
All Of Ours Really
Really
The Doomsday Scenario In Particular
No Not Exactly
I Have Another Source
No
You Arent Actually On The Same Team
No Thats Not It
Its Unbelievable
Her Patience
Never Mind
Something About Longing To Touch You Indiscretely
And That Shes Basically In The Scarlet Throes For You
As Deep In The Flushed Quadrant As One Can Be
To The Letter
Absolutely Not
Yeah
Shes Just A Concerned Moirail
Looking Out For You
Thats All
What Do You Mean
Oh
Hmm
What
Just Presenting A Floating Reminder That Tavros Will Need Plenty Of Inclined Surfaces For His Ascent
Hes Reported Otherwise
Maybe I Should Upend This Load Gaper Over Your Head
Im Still Learning The Interface
It Could Happen Accidentally At Any Moment
Think Of Another Way To Help
Ok
Hmm
I Thought I Was
Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
But Actually
There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
And Somehow
Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
Okay Sorry
Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
That I Read Your Instructional Guide
Your Speech Was Really
Emotional
I Dont Mean To Critique Your Speech
I Just Wanted To Ask You Something In Confidence
About The Humans
Are You Sure Theyre Responsible For Our Misfortune
Was It On Account Of Malice Or Incompetence
It Sort Of Does
Im Not Even That Sure Why
This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
Will Your Response Involve An Athletic Maneuver Of Some Sort
Um
What
Really
Weird
It Is Pretty Disheartening
But
You Are Absolutely Sure They Are All Failures
And That They Have No Chance Of Succeeding
Im Not Sure Which Depresses Me More
The Sabotage Of Our Session Or The Futility Of Theirs
Well I Havent Asked What I Wanted To Ask
Its About TentacleTherapist
You Have Notes On Them
I Guess
Thats Why Youre Our Leader Karkat
Statements Like That Are Also Why Youre Our Leader
Have You Talked To Her
The Rose Human
Also
Do We Really Have To Say Things Like The Rose Human
Uh Okay
It Just
Feels Really Silly When We Say Things Like The John Human In Confidence Amongst Ourselves
The Speech Has Become Emblazoned On My Think Pan
Virtually Ensconced In The Fold Of My Personal Mythology
I Dont Know
Im Not Sure If Ive Got It In Me Right Now
Fine
A Report About What
Is There A Metric For That Concept
That Seems Just As Disparaging To Me As It Is To Her
Hello
Allow Me To Make This Simple
I Am A Troll From Another Universe Using A Chat Client Utility Which Is Capable Of Contacting You And Your Friends At Any Point Of Your Lives Which I Choose Up To And Including The Moment Of Your Own Incompetence Fueled Self Destruction
Im Looking For Evidence Of Intelligence In Your Species
A Reason
Any Reason At All Really
To Justify Wasting The Few Precious Remaining Moments Of My Life On You
It Has Fallen On Your Shoulders To Supply Me With That Reason John Human
Go
What Indeed
I Was Just Leaving
No
We Dont Actually Travel Through
Uh
Well
Not All Of Us Do
One Of Us Does Though
Thats Not What We Are Talking About Here And Is Aside From The Point
No
No John You Werent Listening
Damn It
What The Hell
Okay Youre Even Dumber Than The Rose Human Thats Incredible Really
Im A Girl Not A Boy
It Happens
Yes As A Matter Of Fact
If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement
I Just Spoke To Her In The Future
Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression
But Regardless She Said To Paste Something From Our Conversation
To Get You To Understand Whats Going On
I Have Strong Doubts It Will Be Effective But Here Goes
GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.
TT: you look kind of like... 
TT: howie mandel from little monsters. 
TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster. 
TT: because he was a big goofy adult. 
TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.
GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest 
TT: no, it's a movie. 
TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is. 
Are You Suggesting
I Was Being Trolled
That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish
Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well
Okay
Suspicions Pitching Once Again Toward The Conclusion That You Are Just Very Stupid
Im Guessing Thats The Human Equivalent Of 12th Perigees Eve
Will Your Adult Human Custodian Forage For Leavings As Ours Do
Your Blocks Mean Nothing But Dont Worry You Wont Hear From Me Again
What
The Hell
Did You Just Do
You Actually Did It
Blew It Up I Mean
I Had Begun To Believe That Was Embellishment
What Is It
Yeah
Really
What Questions Do You Have
Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
But Actually
There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
And Somehow
Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
Okay Sorry
Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
That I Read Your Instructional Guide
Yeah
Why
Lately
Almost Perpetually
Wow Yeah Kind Of
Also
That One
Actually
At The Time Of Reading It Lent Some Useful Insight
Into The Nature Of The Game I Hadnt Yet Considered
And
The Author I Guess
Uh
By The Way
What Are You Doing Here
Is This Part Of Your Ongoing Investigation
Are These Tactics Really Necessary
I Know
But I Thought Our Methods Earlier Were Effective
In Illuminating The Underpinnings Of The Game
You Ask Some Questions
And I Answer
If I Can
No
Okay
But These Means Presently On Display
Are Making Me A Little Nervous
I Think Its Kind Of A Reckless Use Of
These Forces
Yes
Well
Influence By The Gods From The Furthest Ring
The Communion You Seem To Have Developed With Them I Find Kind Of Troubling
How Exactly Do You Know That
How Much Time Have You Really Spent Sleeping
Since You Began Playing
That Makes Me No Less Nervous
Our Understanding Is That Influence From Doomed Timelines
Though Seemingly Necessary To Advance In The Alpha Reality
Is Generally Inauspicious
Travelers From Such Branches Are Marked For Death
And Though It Was Only An Insubstantial Part Of You Which Traveled
Just Memories I Suppose
Its Still Troubling
Actually
I Havent
I Have Never Visited Derse Or Traveled Beyond The Veil
Prospits Moon Was My Home
For Most Of My Dreaming Life
Yes
Why
Skaia Was Always The Foil For My Curiosity
But It Only Showed Me What I Needed To See
It Very Much Had The Presence Of Something Sentient
And
Benevolent
But Silent
Not Something To Converse With Or Be Instructed By
Or Anything With An Agenda Beyond Which It Knows To Be Manifest Already
Like A Very Clear Mirror
That Has Everything There Is To See Inside It
But Only Some Things Are Visible At Any Given Moment
I Always Trusted It
And I Dont Trust Gods That Would Eschew Its Light
Oh
A While Ago
I Have To Confess That
Ive Been Experiencing Something Like
Impression Whiplash
Since That Time
At First I Thought You Were Foolish And Incompetent
You See Thats What Im Talking About
That Was A Very Snarky Remark That Happened Just Now
Stratified By Your Signature Varieties Of Insincerity Which Cut Through The Literal Meaning Of The Statement Like Colorful Ribbons
And The Net Intent Is Something Maddening To Try To Know
Its Meaning I Think Exists At The Inscrutable Nexus Of Semantic Space Where Humor Chafes Against Soft Malice
A Place Perhaps The Human Mind Occupies More Comfortably I Dont Know
Xenopsychology Isnt My Strong Suit
Or Even A Real Word
Uh Yeah I Know Im Babbling Again
The Point Is Its Not The Type Of Behavior A Very Stupid Person Can Perpetrate
And So My Impression Has Thrashed Around From Conversation To Conversation
And Now
Rather Than Suspecting You Of Incompetence
I Have Begun To Fear Just The Opposite
I Think You Might Be Dangerous
Maybe Not Knowing That Is What Really Bothers Me
Why Dont You Put The Turtle Ruins Down
And Return To Your House
I Have Sketched Some New Outfits For You That I Think Are Nice
We Could Try To Make Them
It Will Be Fun
Urrgh No
Sadly
What If There Isnt A Later
I Mean
There Not Being A Later Might Happen Sooner Than You Think
I Mean
For You Specifically
Okay
This Was Something Else I Wanted To Say
Or Ask About
But Im Afraid My Asking Might Play A Role In The Outcome
And I Dont Know If I Want That
Um
Alright
I Cant See You In The Future
The Viewport Wont Let Me After A Certain Point
Its Black
But Only For You
Not The Others
Several Hours From Now
Do You Know Why This Could Be
Sort Of
But It Remains Ominous
Also Sort Of
Wait
Is That What Im Doing
On Second Thought
Thats Not What I Want To Do
Well
I Hope That Doesnt Happen
But Id Rather Not Get Stuck In That Kind Of Pattern Again
So If You Want To Wreck Turtle Villages And Tear Your Planet Apart On The Counsel Of Dark Gods
Fine With Me I Guess
Ur
Ill Do The Thing You Do When You Dont Say Anything
"..."
What Was Your Question
I Believe Youre Owed Some Compensatory Ignorance
Ive Never Heard Of It
Agreed
Since The Gap Between Your Present Moment And The Implementation Of Your Mystifying Self Destruction Continues To Narrow
This Will Be The Last Conversation In Which I Attempt To Talk You Out Of It Nicely
First Of All Youre Underestimating The Gravity Of A Dream Death
Its A Pretty Serious Thing Okay
And Dream Selves Are Important To A Person In Ways That Arent Always Obvious
I Think Youre Being Frivolous But Thats Not Really The Sentiment Reinforcing The Exoskeleton Of My Argument
Soon You Will Be Blacked Out Of Trollians Viewport
And I Have No Explanation For This
And Neither Do You
So Ill Just Assume The Worst And You Should Too
Ive Seen You Sleep Before
You Are Just
Asleep
On Screen
Peaceful And Harmless And Posing No Threat To Anyone
Unless I Guess You Are Up To Mischief In Your Dreams Which I Cannot Rule Out
Actually Thats Probably What You Do In Your Sleep What Was I Thinking
Uh
What
Right Sorry
Im Saying This Is A Special Case
It Is Foreboding And Disconcerting And You Are Being Reckless
Your Hubris Is Really Astonishing
Easily Twice The Mass Of A Universe I Think
That It Hasnt Collapsed Upon Itself Into A Tiny Lavender Singularity Is The Most Striking Marvel Paradox Space Has Coughed Up Yet
No Please Stop
Humor Wont Deflect My Really Big And Important Tirade Okay
You Are Investing Too Much Confidence In Evil Gods Who Oppose Skaia And Your True Purpose And
I Cant Abide That
And
As Difficult As This Is For Me To Confess
I Think Your Plan Is Very Dangerous
And So Are You
Yes
And
Im Afraid I Am Going To Have To Devote All My Efforts To Stopping You
Im So Glad You Asked
You See
I Have Been Training A Powerful Wizard
Yes Your Shout Pole Is Like A Tower Broadcasting Your Fear Across The Ring And You Are Right To Be Afraid
I Have Commissioned None Other Than The Legendary Prince Of Hope And I Am Teaching Him The Ways Of White Sorcery
I Have Observed Your Methods And You Will Come To The Most Unwelcome Realization That All Of Your Guile And Cunning Has Finally Backfired
This Noble Magician Of Pure Light Will Serve As The Counterpoint To Your Arcane Debauchery
He Will Hunt You Down And Goodness And Hope Will Prevail
Yes Its Much Too Late For That
Oh Yes I Do Believe Securing A Corpse Box Would Be Prudent
Fitted To Dimensions Suited To Your Myriad Of Unassembled Leaky Body Parts In Aggregate
Yes Definitely
Definitely Do That
Wait I Hope That Wasnt Too Emphatic
Maybe At This Point I Should Clarify This Is All A Big Joke
I Was
Okay Great
I Think What I Find Most Challenging About Human Insincerity Based Humor Is The Degree Of Commitment To The Fantasy Which Is Apparently Requisite
I Mean To Say
The Gesture Of Hostility In This Case Was The Joke
I Did In Fact "Train" This Character
I Made Him A Wand To Shut Him Up
He Wouldnt Stop Harassing Me For Your "Secrets"
Hes The One With The Royalty Complex And Speaks With All The Extra Vees And Doubleyous
Okay
Okay I Will
Uh
Yeah That
Is Still Something That I Dont Really Want To Joke About
I Hope That Came Across As A Sincere Statement
Are You Feeling Any More Cooperative In This Timeframe
I See No Of Course Not
Please
I Know You Were Talking To Her Shortly Before
What Did You Say To Her
Wow
I Still Dont Understand The Password Thing
Past You Doesnt Care About Passwords What Happened
Which Is Favorable
Can We Discuss A Serious Issue In A Silly Manner
How Am I Supposed To Know The Password
I Dont Remember That
I Feel Like I Am Trudging Waist Deep Through A Slither Basin Full Of Your Human Surprise Noodles
I Understand This Silliness Is Currently Permissible But Are Serious Questions About The Password Nonsense Permissible As Well
Why Are You Demanding Passwords From Me And Also Apparently Karkat
I Am Not Trying To Do That
When Will I Get The Password
Im Appreciating Our Conversations From This Timeframe More And More
Past You Is Much Less Of A Taskmaster Than Future You Or Pre Blackout Rose
I Mean Post Blackout Rose Is A Lot Less Difficult Insofar As She Is Unavailable
I Guess Youll Find Out Soon
And Then Report It To Me Under Extremely Specific Circumstances
Which Is Good Because I Sure Dont Know
Yes Hmm And That Face Is A Good Response
Your Eyes Are Right To Be Swirled Letters
What Are You Doing
I See
Well I Didnt Actually Tell You To I Was Just Being Informative
Also It Isnt Technically Witch Of Spacey Stuff
I Was A Sylph Not A Witch
I Think Its Sort Of Like A Witch
But More Magical
Yes Im Completely Certain Of That Suddenly
But Regardless I Think Our Roles Are Approximately The Same Since We Are Both Stokers Of The Forge
As Well As Holders Of Breeding Duties
However I Should Clarify That My Earlier Counsel Was Mostly Academic
It Takes Weeks To Do All Of It Properly
You Wont Have Time
Yeah
What Does It Sound Like
Well It Does
But Not Breeding Through Means Typical Of Most Species
It Has A Lot To Do With It
It Is Cloning Equipment Much Like What Is Scattered All Over The Veil
The Same Kind Responsible For Creating All Of Us
I Didnt Mean To Alarm You By Implying You Were Required To Wage A Great Deal Of Personal Procreation Over A Span Of Several Weeks
Though It Should Be Clear That Repopulation Is Among Our Duties As Well In The Long Term
And Ive Gathered That The Cloning Apparatus In The Veil Is Probably Meant To Permit An Initial Boost On The World We Select For Settlement
But Beyond That It Is Up To The Descendants To Perpetuate The Race
And Your Species Has Quite An Advantage In This Respect
Your Procreation May Be Carried Out By Paired Individuals Autonomously
Whereas Ours May Not
Which Is What Makes My Role Particularly Important
Im The Keeper Of The Matriorb
It Is An Egg That Will Hatch A New Mother Grub
She Alone Will Be Responsible For Bearing Our Young
I Guess So
And You Are Like Erect Livestock
Without The Muscle Definition
Or The Hermaphroditic Physiology For That Matter
But Milk Producers Nonetheless
That Rare Kind Of Organism To Nurture Hatchless Young Within
Are You Not
Anyway
I Had Imagined I Would Hatch The New Grub On A Planet In Your Universe
And When That Became Impossible I Quickly Lost Hope
I Assumed It Would Remain Locked In Its Card Forever
Which Could Only Be Opened When The Orb Was Meant To Be Used
But Then I Found Something Quite Unexpected When I Was Exploring This Lab
I Found A Key
It Was Deep In The Meteor
And As I Suspected It Released The Orb
Which Was Really Confusing To Me For A While
Until I Realized What It Meant
Which Is So Obvious Im Amazed I Didnt Think Of It Right Away
It Means I Am Supposed To Use It Now
To Hatch The Grub In The Heart Of This Meteor
Sure
There Is No Reason A Meteor Couldnt Act As The Center Of Our Races Resurrection
They Are Themselves Like Large Seeds After All
The Only Question Is Whether We Can Manage To Keep It From Being Destroyed
As Well As Whether I Am Able To Raise A Mother Grub To Maturity
Oh Wow That Thought Is Actually Pretty Overwhelming
You Do
Yes She Was In Fact A Mother Grub
Who Relinquished Her Calling As Matriarch To Raise Me
Okay
Thanks For Saying So
Its Very Involved 
Like I Said You Wont Have Time 
In Fact It Probably Should Have Taken Considerably Longer Than It Took Me 
I Was A Little Rushed 
Yes Youre Right 
I Cant Imagine How You Can Complete The Objective In The Time Given 
But Weirder Things Have Happened I Think 
First Deploy The Pad 
Um 
Why All The Way Up There 
Yes Thats Right 
That Will Probably Change If You Light The Forge 
But One Thing At A Time I Guess 
Thats The Appropriate Size For The Equipment 
Babies 
What 
Yes I Know 
I Didnt Mean To Suggest Your Breeding Duties Involved Cloning Humans 
Repopulation Is Not Whats Happening Here 
Its Not Your Objective As The Witch Of Space 
Not Yet Anyway 
Frogs 
Sorry I Thought That Was Obvious
Yes 
What Are You Laughing At There 
What Is He Saying 
Hmm
Okay Im Laughing Pretty Hard At All That
He Will Need To Deploy The Terminal
Then You Can Start Hunting For Frogs To Appearify From Around Your World
I Would Conjecture That Most Of Them Are
And Will Stay That Way Until The Forge Is Brought To Life
I Think The Event Is Designed To Trigger Drastic Planetary Upheaval Wherever The Forge Is Stationed
It Did On My Planet As Well
No Mostly Water
Yes
It Probably Wont Do Any Good But You Can Try
The Problem Isnt That The Frog Is Still Frozen
The Problem Is That You Were Able To Appearify It At All
Ectobiology Is Based Entirely On Your Inability To Appearify A Subject
If That Frog Were Destined To Do Something Else
Such As Become Ensnared In Your Net Later
You Would Not Be Able To Appearify It Because That Would Cause A Paradox
So Instead You Would Appearify Its Slime Imprint
The Paradox Slime Is What Is Important Here
You Can Mix It With The Slime From Other Paradoxically Appearified Frog Imprints
Study The Genes And Selectively Combine
And Then Create Resulting Paradox Clones
You Will Need To Direct The Terminal To Another Frog
And Then You Must Be Sure Later To Interfere With That Frog In Some Way
For Instance By Planning To Venture Out To Capture That Exact Frog As I Suggested Earlier
That Way It Will Be Impossible To Appearify The Frog Before Your Interference Has Taken Place
Only Its Slime Will Arrive
Yes
Yes That Should Work
Make A Note Of The Coordinates
When You Travel To Interact With Your Cloned Subjects You Are Also Taking The Opportunity To Explore And Discover New Habitats
As Well As New Species Of Frogs For Your Terminal To Track
Its Efficient To Go Adventuring In This Fashion While You Are Waiting For Your Young Clones To Mature
Yes Its A Lot Of Fun
It Is Also Extremely Time Consuming
Unlike Some Appearifiers In The Veil This One Is Locked To The Present Moment
You Cannot Use It As A Window Into The Future Or Past And Isolate Frogs Whose Futures Are Certain And Therefore Most Paradoxifiable
Means Of Expedition Are Limited
I Suppose You Could Use Time Travel To Accelerate The Process
But You Would Need To Establish Weeks Worth Of Stable Time Loops
I Think It Would Be An Overly Elaborate And Dangerous Undertaking Personally And Anyone Who Would Attempt Such A Thing Is Reckless
I Wouldnt Advise It
Youll Need Somewhere To Keep Them While They Grow
Like A Pool Or A Tank Or Such
Or At Least Something Temporary
Water Wasnt Very Hard For Me To Come By But For You I Dont Know
Yes But This Isnt All There Is To The Cloning Process
A True Paradox Clone Is An Exact Genetic Duplicate Of The Subject
Later That Clone Will Be Sent Back In Time To Become Itself
In Fact If It Is An Exact Duplicate This Is Guaranteed To Happen
This Is What Classifies It As A Paradox Clone
Any Duplicate Which Genetically Deviates From The Original Is Not
It Is Simply A Mutant
And For Breeding Purposes Mutation Is Desirable
Within Reason
You May Adjust The Settings On The Equipment To Promote Genetic Anomalies
But Its Very Delicate And You Can Go Too Far
Responsibly Guiding The Evolution Of The Genetic Code During The Breeding Process Is Very Important
In Fact It Is The Most Important Thing About This Of All
Yes
Actually
Yes
Thats Exactly What Youre Doing
Your Objective Is To Breed The Genesis Frog
You Cant Complete The Game Without Doing So
Your Entire Mission Depends On Breeding Him
Yes
He Will Begin As A Tadpole Like You Have There But Considerably Bigger
And He Will Mature To Become The Speaker
A Deity Like Figure Idolized By The Consorts Who Wait For Him To Come
Hes Known As The Speaker Of The Vast Croak
Yes The Croak Really Is Quite Vast And Is Something To Behold
Its The Most Amazing Thing I Have Seen
Yes There Will Be One For Every Session Should The Players Be Successful
And Each One Is A Unique Product Of Their Quest
The Kingdoms Are At Odds Over His Creation
Prospit Worships Him Much As The Consorts Do
Derse Reviles Him And Outlaws Frogs Wherever They Can
Even The Iconography
Their Agents Mock His Name With Slurs
Like Speaker Of The Vast Joke
Or Bilious Slick
Although To Be Honest That Is What We Ended Up Calling Him
Not To Be Disrespectful Though It Was Just A Catchier Name
I Doubt Its Even Possible To Offend Him
Most Certainly
No
Youre Not Really Understanding The Magnitude Of His Role
He Is Not Responsible For Just One Aspect Of The Universe You Create
Hes Responsible For All Of Them
Bilious Slick Is Your Universe
I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From
We Engineered That Incarnation
He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create
Sorry
I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure
Yes Literally
That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be
I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons
Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks
Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose
Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That
Its A Nice Change Of Pace
Oh Its Not Important
Well
Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation
Sort Of
I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be
I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though
It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her
I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess
She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent
And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me
You Are More Sensible
Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You
Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit
Like Me
If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This
I Woke Up A Long Time Ago
I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young
The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess
My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help
And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert
Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White
He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit
Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since
He Said He Was My Guardian
And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That
Then Later He Stopped Coming
In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind
Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It
But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real
He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party
And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes
It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy
Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements
But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great
I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me
And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People
Youre Right We Do
I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role
It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By
To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It
I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems
Yes Definitely
We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems
I Believe She Is Yours
And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough
She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned
And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations
Yes
And Hes Not Merely A Guardian
Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian
Like Your Lusus Was
I Feel The Same Way About It
The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious
Even When Seemingly Benign
She Was
Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon
After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me
In The Meantime I Will Go
I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb
It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now
Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can
The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together
Ill Message You Again In Your Future
And You May Reply If You Have Cause To
Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords
Yes You
You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me
Thats A Reasonable Attitude
Okay
Ten
Im Counting Eleven
The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality
Oh
Wow Yeah
I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity
Oh No
Yeah I Know
Yes Ill Do That
Bye Jade
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHO ARE YOU, AND WHY ARE YOU MESSAGING ME THROUGH KANAYA'S ACCOUNT?
I SERIOUSLY DON'T NEED THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW.
Oh Really
This Is A Dream Isnt It
It Seemed Obvious
Either Im Sleeping Or Im Dead Which Is It
My New Self
You Mean
Being A Ghost And Then A Frog And Then A Robot And Then A Fairy
Kind Of
What Do You Mean We Have Been Groomed
Okay
What Do I Do
Was What We Were Attempting Before Not Old Fashioned
It Seems To Me The Nature Of The Afterlife Is Probably Very Old Fashioned
Maybe Even The Most Old Fashioned A Thing Can Get
Yes Then
This Was When You Were About To Give Me That Unusual Gift From The Ruins
Yeah Im Still Not Sure Aradia Are We Supposed To Be Role Playing
Hi Jade
Uh
What Is That Thing Youre Wearing
No I Didnt Mean To Sound Disapproving
But I Do Think More Colorful Apparel Suits You Better
I Did
About What
Whats A Vampire
There Isnt Much To Say
I Repaired The Doll And Made Him A Nice Outfit
With A Far More Becoming Palette And Fit Than The Absurd Tatters He Was Found In
I Thought At Least
Uh
Should There Be Anything Else To This Story
Anyway That Is All I Can Remember
I Quickly Began To Find The Doll Unnerving So I Put Him Away
To My Knowledge He Has Remained Secure In My Block Ever Since
Is He Relevant In Some Way
Yes Aradia It Seems You Have Some Foreknowledge Of This Narrative Maybe You Can Tell Us Why Any Of This Is Important
Whos We
Of Course Not
But If Youre Referring To The Short Term Memory Loss We All Seem To Be Experiencing Yes Ive Got That Too
How Do You Know Im On Lofaf
I Didnt Think Karkat Could Remember The Acronyms For Your Planets
Okay
Shes Apparently On Lolar
Shes With Rose
No
But It Seems Theyve Both Surmised The Missing Events Since We Arrived
Well They Are Seers After All
Im A Sylph!!!
I Am On Record As Once Having Facetiously Likened It To A Magical Witch
If Its Any Reassurance You Seem Like The Same Old Dave To Me
I Dont Know
Rose Was Trying To Tell Me But She Ceased Being Comprehensible
No
Its Just That Her Words Suddenly Became
Why Dont You Just Talk To Her And See For Yourself
I Know Right
Yes
Oh
She Wants Us To Speak With Echidna
Yes
About Releasing The New Frog
Hi
Yeah
What Problem
Oh
Right
Okay
No
Well
Yes Sort Of
Im Um
Just Buying Some Things
Just Some
Provisions
A Local Vendor
No
Definitely Not Jars Of
Bugs
No
I Really Should Go
Lets Talk About My Problem Later
Yes
Definitely
Bye
