3551
sup
3557
dont talk to john anymore hes an impressionable doofus
3557
your plan didnt work
3557
i mean it did
3557
but then suddenly it didnt
3557
so you might as well quit trying
3557
what
3557
youre aliens do you even have orange creamsicles
3557
ok pretty far fetched but whatever
3557
no more hijinks from you cause ill make sure they wont work
3557
i dont think youre following
3557
you DID kill him sort of
3557
then i went back in time to stop him
3557
alright but
3557
did you guess that by trolling john to his grave
3557
and making me splinter us off into an alt timeline
3557
that you were basically complicit in making our timeline go the way it was supposed to go all along
3557
where future me is now helping dave and we just keep playing
3557
and our actions ultimately lead to the trouble youre all in now
3557
thus leading you all to troll us incompetently
3557
yeah
3557
see
3557
none of you ever thinks anything through
3557
whos in charge of timeline management there
3557
i gotta give him the business
3557
well at least you got john to off himself so i guess youre not totally incompetent like the others
3557
like that awful rapper
3557
yeah
3557
im telling you
3557
huge pushover
3557
he will do what you say
3557
unless it happens to be for his own good
3557
then all a sudden hes a tough nut to crack go figure
3557
yeah thats fine i guess
3557
no more coy bullshit antics though
3557
not even like
3557
an idiotic angry winking emote
3557
yeah
3557
ok even if thats true
3557
i just merged with an impaled orange goddamn bird and now i got all these crazy powers
3557
what
3557
oh jegus fuck no
3557
why would that breathtaking douche remind you of me at all
3557
now i know youre bullshitting me
3557
do i seem like the kind of guy whod accept a magic ring from whoopi goldberg
3557
to awaken some egregious homofantasy for a ripped blue dudes mammoth eco friendly bulge
3557
that guys an asshole and needs to be sealed in a dufflebag and whipped something ungodly with a bamboo chute
3557
who cares
3557
ahahahahaha
3557
ok yeah that is pretty much fucking spot on
3557
youre actually a pretty good troll
3557
as long as you dont bug john i guess thats all there is to say on the matter
3558
just telling a troll to step off
3558
well i knew a lot anyway
3558
cause im from the future
3558
but yeah i know more stuff now
3558
like things meant specifically for sprites to clue players in on
3558
but packaged in these like
3558
i guess riddles
3558
im supposed to be cagey about it
3558
but i dont really feel like it
3558
ask me anything go ahead ill give you a straight answer
3558
thats the best fucking question anybody ever asked
3558
thats up to him
3558
if he decides to wise up and listen to us
3558
if not then we just bail everyone out yet again
3558
all that gear you picked up should let you breeze through the first couple gates
3558
even at a low level
3558
later youll unlock the ability to bring your sprite down with you
3558
and well take care of shit together
3558
til then i guess just mess around and let jade build up or whatever
3558
ill go kill some time
3558
maybe draw some comics
3558
i dont know
3558
whats the last one you did
3558
oh yeah
3558
i gave up on that half way through
3558
lets do some brainstorming later
3558
blow everyones minds
3592
wow ok
3592
youre a little early
3592
but thats fine i guess
3592
also you suck at rockets
3592
what
3592
who
3592
dude you did go through the second gate
3592
i mean i dont know why you would listen to her again
3592
kind of moronic but thats a whole other issue
3592
she didnt trick you this time
3592
what were you expecting
3592
this is how it works
3592
the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing
3592
cycling through each planet
3592
gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses
3592
then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on her planet
3592
you look for gate 4 somewhere there
3592
which leads to gate 4 above my house
3592
and so on
3592
ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1
3592
but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously
3592
and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was built up
3592
so you wouldnt fall to your death
3592
but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine
3592
see we all got to coordinate on this thing
3592
fuck
3592
come on dude
3592
god dammit
3592
i am the real dave
3592
you know the one who saved your life
3592
im more real actually cause ive been through some heavy shit already hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year
3592
and grinding shit out for your ungrateful ass
3592
here look check out this code from the future not that you deserve it WIin189Q
3592
youre fucking welcome
3592
dave is here he wants to use the computer
3592
probably to help you scope out roses room and snoop and stuff
3592
i mean thats what i would have done
3592
if you were alive
3592
so im gonna go
3592
use these flappy ghost wings and tear shit up in space or something
3592
what
3592
yeah
3640
really powerful hammer
3640
i cant
3640
better be though
3640
got it from hephaestus
3640
really tough to kill dude
3640
nope
3640
shenanigans
3758
so really why are you burning that
3758
no i know
3758
im using daves spare computer i saw the whole conversation through his pesterchum account
3758
i just mean
3758
you didnt burn that book in the future
3758
that book was completely pointless
3758
so does that mean the sleeping thing worked
3758
you remember the future
3758
ok cool
3758
so why is the cat code so terrible now
3758
well ok i guess its done but why are you so sure theyre right
3758
i guess not
3758
but they sort of freak me out
3758
i mean listening to gross space mutants all day isnt my idea of an awesome time
3758
especially the ones that sing oh god
3758
no i flip out to ill jams because they kick ass
3758
obviously
3758
yeah case the fuck closed
3761
i know its crazy what kind of foresight this guy has
3761
im telling you coincidences like that are unreal they dont even happen
3761
most of the time
3761
dude our shit is SAFE
3761
gonna sleep pretty sound tonight
3761
with that big fucking payload of safety you just got dropped on us
3761
gonna be all huggin my pillow and shit
3761
grinning like a goddamn bear full of honey
3761
asshole thinks its candy
3761
doesnt even know he just stepped on a security rake and got a face full of fucking safety
3761
alright
4735
hey
4736
oh looks like you got caledfwlch
4736
you found that pretty fast
4736
yeah i guess so
4736
i think its welsh
4736
thats an awesome question
4736
tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better
4736
caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc
4736
and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options
4736
hahahaha
4736
with unreal air as a mount fit for a true artifact knight
4736
did that shit ever land or what
4736
fuck
4736
top priority make more
4736
thats an order from your celestial fuckin spirit guide
4736
it was stolen
4736
by one of hephaestus's minions
4736
yeah lord of the forge
4736
yeah pretty much
4736
anyway he gets pissed off you broke it
4736
and he wants it back
4736
to do something important with it though not really sure what
4736
hes a pretty ornery dude
4736
kept raving about how he was waiting for the forge to come
4736
which he needs to complete his work
4736
but in my timeline the forge would never come
4736
so he was extra pissed off
4736
volcano
4736
yup
4736
both
4736
theres all sorts of stuff i suddenly knew about the game when i became this orange feathery asshole
4736
i am fuckin filthy with wisdom its sick
4736
i mostly know stuff about your personal quest
4736
what used to be my quest but i guess i got to deal with not being alpha dave no more
4736
shrug
4736
its all good
4736
anyway that sword
4736
its important to getting your shit figured out
4736
you were supposed to break it to get it out of the thing
4736
like another personal sort of mythological milestone you were supposed to clear
4736
well i dont know
4736
maybe if john was to try with his pure heart and shit it woulda popped out like a champagne cork and fuckin hero confetti woulda blasted him in the face
4736
but you
4736
we
4736
we had to break it
4736
theres a lot more i know about your quest
4736
all tangled up in ridiculous riddles and bullshit enigmas
4736
and maybe its all a moot point anyway in this timeline who knows
4736
but i think ill spare you all that crap
4736
cause its kind of boring
4736
and youll find out anyway
4737
oh yeah why
4737
rose beckoning you again
4737
yeah they werent too happy with my reckless indiana jones bullshit either
4737
i got your back dude dont worry
4737
when you wake up
4737
ill probably get going
4737
ill just sort of
4737
release myself
4737
go do my own thing
4737
after this i dont think youll need me
4737
seems like youve got the stable time loop thing figured out already
4737
which means youll be alright
4737
future yous will get you out of trouble
4737
if youre gonna live up to the responsibility of eventually becoming them
4737
and by virtue of loop stability it sort of means you cant technically fuck up anymore
4737
but dont let that idea go to your head itll mess you up
4737
dunno
4737
fly around
4737
up away to the sun like a fucknig piece of gargbage
4737
see if i can catch up with bro maybe
4737
elusive bastard
4737
who knows
4737
i completely lost track of him
4737
in that timeline and this one
4737
the dude is fucking inscrutable we both know that
4737
thanks man
4740
caw caw motherfuckers
5789
hey
5826
been better
5826
what happened to you
5826
oh
5826
i turned into a bird and got in a fight
5827
what this thing
5827
legendary sword
5827
long story
5827
shenanigans mostly
5827
well
5827
basically im from another timeline
5827
we couldnt win the game there so i came back to help dave
5827
dave from this timeline
5827
as a sprite im supposed to help him with his quest
5827
shes doing alright dont worry about it
5827
so things kind of became even more crazy in this timeline than the one i was from
5827
and it was clear dave was never gonna do the quest i didnt get the chance to finish
5827
not even after you brought the forge
5827
your volcano
5827
so
5827
after laying low for a while
5827
i just went and did whatever i could myself
5827
got caledfwlch
5827
the fuckin welsh sword dave broke
5827
went to look for hephaestus again
5827
figuring there wasnt much hope in beating him this time either especially being injured and all but what the hell right
5827
but then
5827
thats when you lit the forge somehow
5827
well no
5827
not you other jade
5827
sounds like you came back because jade made the decision for you
5827
i made the decision to come back myself maybe itd be different if you had the same chance
5827
i think everyones on top of this
5827
theres not much for us to do anymore
5827
i guess so
5827
but not really for me since im not the real dave anymore
5827
thats a bit complicated
5827
see it turns out
5827
i had no idea how the denizens worked at all
5844
i busted into his palace
5844
to finish the quest
5844
i was expecting him to be asleep and was gonna figure out some way to wake him up
5844
but like last time i saw him
5844
he was already awake to greet me
5844
they are
5844
as sprites were programmed to know things like that about the game
5844
but i guess not everything
5844
it seems like if you try to go fight them too soon
5844
you find them awake and theyre like
5844
what the fuck are you doing here already
5844
which is what happened last time i saw him
5844
before i became a sprite
5844
and i stupidly tried to fight him which was a bad idea because hes hella strong
5844
and the whole time he was raving about shit
5844
about a stolen sword and missing forge
5844
but i wasnt really listening
5844
if i had i might have understood
5844
he wasnt actually trying to kill me he was giving me the choice
5844
wait i mean The Choice
5844
i always forget i can talk underlined for important shit
5844
i guess i made an unwitting choice
5844
by deciding to flee
5844
i figured he was unbeatable so i decided to get the fuck out of there
5844
so i snapped a quick captcha to get his huge hammers code and then gtfo
5844
like i said he was awake again
5844
but this time i wasnt in any condition to fight
5844
so i didnt
5844
and thats what i didnt get
5844
hes this terrible angry monstrous guy but theres no need to fight him
5844
so he looked me up and down all hard
5844
saw the broken sword
5844
and like before gave me the choice
5844
yeah
5844
no
5845
it was different
5845
i think it must be always different
5845
depending on the circumstances
5845
i dont know what the choice is when you face him the way youre supposed to
5845
but im showing up as this bleeding bird sprite holding his broken sword
5845
so thats pretty odd situation
5845
he sees i got his sword and its busted and you can tell hes pissed
5845
but like before its like restrained anger
5845
like hes always about to just fucking flip but still keeps it together
5845
so he can tell me
5845
he can repair it
5845
and make the deringer with the forge lit
5845
he says he can repair anything
5845
but only one thing
5845
and i had to choose
5845
so i said ok fix the sword
5845
meh
5845
doesnt matter really
5845
i just thought making the sword felt like the right thing
5845
so i gave him the sword
5845
but it still wasnt all that simple
5845
he needed lava from the forge to make it
5845
which means echidna had to be awake
5845
our denizens had to have some kind of truce to make it happen
5845
see what i mean about it being complicated
5845
so jade must have done something right
5845
to wake her up and get the forge going
5845
dont know what she did though
5845
are you sure
5846
reckoning
5846
its getting close to the end
5846
more meteors are getting by the portals
5846
the battlefield will probably be wiped out soon
5846
would there be a point
5846
yeah me too
5846
what would you want to do
5846
if you werent scared
5846
well
5846
i was going to bring this sword to dave
5846
no
5846
i was gonna say
5846
im not in any shape for more adventuring
5846
i figure this is probably my last stop
5846
but maybe this is a way you can help
5846
if you want
5846
maybe you dont have to actually go anywhere
5846
you oughta have a lot of special powers remember
5846
because of ascending to doghood
5846
try doing your spacey thing
5846
i mean not to sound condescending or anything but its got to be like borderline omnipotence pretty much
5846
just put your mind to it
6243
yeah no shit
6244
let me check it out
6244
maybe ill humorously defile willis and afflecks dumb skyward yearning faces
6244
come on dude hand it over
6244
too late i already did it with sprite powers while he wasnt looking
6245
ahahahaha you fucked up
7841
wake up sleepy head
7841
wait why did i even say that
7841
stay asleep all you want like i give a fuck
7842
but you are kind of missing some important shit here
7842
we spent three faux relativistic years cruising through the metaphysical asscrack of nowhere
7842
and when we finally get here youre all tuckered out
7842
like yall didnt sleep enough on this boat already
7842
some of the sicknastiest shuteye anyone ever got i owe to this friggin boat
7842
dude this is a big deal everyones waiting for us out there
7842
i mean...
7842
probably
7842
i dont know where we are some green hilly place with all these stone henges sprinkled around
7842
did you know there could be a plurality of stone henges i didnt but guess fucking what
7842
henges APLENTY where this place is concerned
7842
hey wheres jade
7843
i guess she left already?
7843
maybe there was an emergency somewhere and her doggy senses led her there
7843
maybe someone fell down a well
7843
what do you think john do you think our teen parents fell down a well
7843
nah i sincerely doubt that any of them would be that pathetic
7843
whatever it was it must have been important enough for jade to ditch us like this
7843
either that or
7843
maybe she was that desperate to finally get away from me
7843
between you and me john
7843
i didnt really handle things with her as well as i could have
7843
oh well maybe real dave will treat her better
7843
or not i dont know
7843
i did her a favor cutting bird dave out of her life
7843
nobody really deserves bird dave as a boyfriend or a friend or anything its like getting one of the janky daves from the bargain bin at the dave depot
7843
or one of the marked down daves the day after national dave day
7843
its like somebody taxedermized your dave and expected you not to notice
7843
"feathers what feathers haha no that dave is totally normal and ok"
7843
you should just go back to being bros with real dave when you see him
7843
ill be fine ill just flap around and do my thing alone
7843
im completely alright with that at this point
7843
we had our ups and downs john but all in all it was cool to go on this road trip with you
7843
there were some times man
7843
the times
7843
im telling you they were unreal
7843
i bet you people would pay good money to see every second of the madcap stunts that were going down on this ship basically 24/7
7843
if hulls could talk wow
7843
haha just joking it was seriously boring as hell
7843
but i mean it was still cool so yeah
7843
hey
7843
whats that ring anyway
7843
ive seen you with that ring before and i guess i was just like
7843
ok john has a magic ring for some reason
7843
no need to mention that or anything
7843
but where did you even get it
7843
you cant even hear me you got your snooze on so hard
7843
aint gonna wake you up to hassle you about no ring
7843
i probably should have said all this stuff when you were awake anyway
7843
like the stuff about friendship
7843
fuck it ill just leave another one of my patented magic notes taped to your shoe or your cowlick or something
7843
my magic notes rule ill miss leavin em taped on stuff
7844
i sure do talk to myself a lot dont i
7844
wow why have i never made this observation
7844
i probably needed to be a bird for exactly three years to finally have that epiphany
7844
i wonder if real dave ever had that epiphany
7844
probably not cause hes not a bird
7844
the bottom line is being a guy whos also a bird makes you think
7844
anyway im out
7845
p.s. happy birthday john
7845
have some watermarks for the road
8502
what
8504
over what
