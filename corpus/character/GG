hi happy birthday rose!!! <3
did you get johns present yet?
yeah i know!!
what will you make with it?
well john did tell me what it was duh.....

you see not everybody always means the opposite of what they say the way you and dave always do
yep!
i finally finished a present for him
ive been working on it for years!!!!
heheheh.... :)
i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time
mail takes a while to get anywhere from here!!!
i dont think you really mean that!
err.......
no :(
sorry but you are sort of hard shop for <_<
besides i have something for you today that i think you will like better than some thing in a box!
it is a tip!!!!
did you have a pet a long time ago that died?
ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?
ummmmm ok....
thats fine!!!
it doesnt really matter i think, just.....
what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to life?
yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!
i just thought you might find it interesting
oh i dont know
im just saying is all
i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave about it
they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!
hey!!!!
how is your adventure going john?
thats good!!
hmm well i think whatever it is it must be pretty important!
dont lose hope john i think it will all turn out for the best if you stay positive....
just keep listening to your grandmothers advice!!!
oh uhhh.......

yeah maybe that was it!!
heheheh :D
oh well john
i want to explain lots of things to you....
some things that i know
im just......
waiting!
oh! john!!!
i forgot i was messaging you about that meteor that fell near my house!
oh boy.... well........
it turns out i was confused about it...
really confused! o_o;
see i guess i fell asleep for a while and.....
lost track of time
that happens!!
well.....
its hard to explain!!!
but...
i know what it is now!
and now i know everythings going to be ok!!!
oh gosh john i really want to tell you all this stuff!!!
but i cant yet
i really think you need to wake up first!

<3
hahaha yes ok but we cant talk for long!!!
well yes i do but its just that you will lose your internet connection soon!!!!!
and we wont talk again for a pretty long time
not until you enter!
yeah!
lol what did you want to know?
there sure are a lot of challenges but yes i am sure!!
dave is cool, you know he will come around when the time is right
he just has a lot of work to do first
and so do you! 
youll need to keep searching for a stable signal and power source, it will be hard but dont give up!!!
and dont worry about me either, focus on playing with john first
it all starts with you two!
haha dark? thats ridiculous!
i dont really know what to tell you other than its not going to be what you think it is
and most importantly you will have your questions answered, but they will be the ones you havent thought to ask yet!
just be patient and be brave youll see
it will be fun!!!!!!
uh oh looks like youve got to go
take care rose! <3<3<3
oh nooooooo
>:O
you can leave me alone!!!!!
how can you even be talking to me after i blocked you....
AND after i logged out????
i get that youre a jerk and you should shut up!
goodbye you jerk!!!!!!!!!
yay thank you john!!!!! :D
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that!
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!!
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait!
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does!
<3......
uhhhh hold on
ok im back sorry
i had to tell someone to go away!
yup :o
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
i have counted twelve
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
but i think they are mostly harmless
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe
john did you get my package??
darn! are you sure? it was in a green box.....

no i havent talked to her yet but id like to soon
ive got a lot of catching up to do with all of you!
sorry ive been so scarce ive just been so busy running around like crazy and looking after my dog and stuff all day!!!!
i think he just locked me in my room actually :\
yeah
:D
hey john can you hold on i have to talk to dave and start playing this game with him
sburb!!!! duh what else!
oh jeez i was asleep when i said that silly!
of course i know what it is
from the ruins
its daves copy
i know right! hehehe
oh!!!!
that reminds me since im setting the game up with dave to be his server you are going to need to do the same thing for me
can you see from where youre standing the place your dads car would have fallen?
you should go there and get your copy of the server and set up with me.....
oh and also get your package!!!!!! :)
johhhhn will you stop trying to trap me!!!
you TOLD me the car fell remember?
jeeeez
JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!!!!! 
john im not any more psychic than you though
hahahaha oops ok!
i mean i know lots of things but im really serious its no more information than what you have access to 
but you dont know it yet
anyway we can talk more about it soon.....
i wont have to be so coy with you anymore because im pretty sure most of the stuff that was supposed to happen has already happened
i couldnt tell you about it because it would have messed it up!
just give me a few minutes while i set up this game!
and say hi to the salamanders for me
<3
yo yooooooo!!!!!!!
so youre finally playing the game with rose?
shes probably just exploring im sure she will come around soon....
but its great that you got her out of there in time!!!
so how does it feel to be a BIG TIME HERO
mister braveybrave mcheropants
hehehe 
but it turns out to be CRAZY what kind of basket ball this man plays!
ummmm......
the HOOP IS ON FIRE...
ok i forget how it goes
yes!!!!!!
so now it is my turn to be the star!
i will be your hero
its me
i installed the game!
im connecting to you as the server player
dont worry!
you can keep playing with rose while i just set up a few things
i figured id get a good head start to avoid all the drama you guys are always getting into 
such a bunch of drama queens!!!
(DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA)
yes!
itll come when it comes regardless of what we do
the timer really just lets you know when its coming
yes look here it is!
http://bit.ly/d7kXrQ
it is REALLY REALLY big
ok i dont actually know :(
hehe yeah....
thanks i will! <3
these darn birds are in the way!
what are they doing in your apartment anyway!!!
also they are adorable
ohhhhhhh
kind of like all those silly naked puppets are your bros thing?
also i think i cant put it down because of the wires on the floor.....
i wish i played more games
this is hard!!!!
:P
oh fuck!!!!!!
hi dave!!!!
hehehe what??
4 hours until what?
ummm....
i................
i think i might be!
im not panicking i feel fine!
<_<;
i wont look ok jeez!!!!!
stop being a huge baby and go peeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
:(
dave
:(
dave this poor bird
the one with the sword through it!!!
but isnt this your sword?
:|
all i know is........
its sharp and its through a bird and its a sword
end of story!!!!!!
i am going to help the poor bird
what do you mean i just brought the cute birdie back to life!!!
isnt he great?
gosh im SOOOO SOOOORRY!!!!!!!!
i was tired!
well you are out of luck.....
i will wake up when im good and ready!
yes why
ummmmmm....
the right side...
why??
okaaay......
...
duuurrrrr dave i was going to build some stairs up there durrrrrhhhhhh
gosh i dont know i guess i didnt find the time to make them because i keep getting punched in the face by robots and stuff!!!!!!!
;p
i dont know!
nope....
what was it doing up here?
i think your sprite wants to hatch it!
awww
hmm...
i dont know it looks like its pretty warm where you are
maybe not too long then????
i guess we'll find out!
:(
ok some of these things we can deploy but some things we dont have nearly enough grist for!
no no weve got enough for that.....
but its still pretty expensive
yeah me too!
and we have 2000 to work with
ok 1998 ._.
ohhh...
how much did rose start with? when she was playing with john?
k
i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection!
no!!!!
i cant buy the holopad thingy and the intellibeam laserstation
hahahaha no theyre right here!
they cost a fortune
yeah ive got that too!
i will deploy it
yes i think that is how it works
when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!
i suppose just hang on to them for a while........
and then later
just do whatever you are naturally compelled to do with them!
yay thank you john!!!!! :D
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that!
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!!
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait!
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does!
<3......
uhhhh hold on
what do you want?????
this is nonsense
every time i believe something you say you laugh at me and call me a gullible human!!!!
its so childish
D:
i dont know what youre talking about at all.....
its another prank
no
you mean the robot you think is stupid?
the one youve mocked me for having on a number of occasions???
this is the worst prank youve ever pulled!!!!!!
why should i do that?
ok im back sorry
i had to tell someone to go away!
yup :o
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
i have counted twelve
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
but i think they are mostly harmless
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe
dave here punch this code!
L229BxoG
and then put it in the jumper shunty thing and see what it does
well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features....
hang on ill give you more codes!!!
hehehe......
yeah i bet hes right!
wow no i dont think so...
hes being a bit more literal than that!
what did he say?
:)
well what he meant was.....
that you have a dream self
who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep
we all do! all four of us i mean
but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep
because you havent woken up yet!
yes
no you would not be out of line!
in fact im asleep now
:p
no only i can do that!
because of my robot
you guys can probably make your own i guess......
but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!!
um.......
ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming!
shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless
about things burdening her
which is to say you!!!!!
things about who you really are and what your purpose is
but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet
thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!
im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious
or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?
i dunno! its for you to find out
maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue?
the....
er
didnt dave tell you?
._.
he said he was going to tell you <_<;
yeah hes pretty tied up right now!
noooooooooooooooooooo
he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep!
but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(
yeah hes pretty tied up right now!
noooooooooooooooooooo
he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep!
but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(
ummmmmm.....
oh! yes it appears so!!!
i guess! ive been pretty busy here
ive had to stay asleep for a long time because john is supposed to wake up soon
but he just wont wake up!!!!!
im pretty sure im supposed to be the one to wake him but i dont know what to do :(
huh??
oh......
well thanks for trying anyway!
i hope so!
what am i doing when i wake up?
oh no!!!!!
yes i know what you mean....
that sounds like it would be fun!
but you guys never even played pranks on me, you were always just kinda mean D:
well i know i havent trolled you guys!
or not yet.........
heheheh
oh yeah!
i totally forgot about that
does it really blow up or was that another trick?
hmmmmm
you could ask me in the future!
is he not a nice guy?
hmmm....
well maybe hes just been through some tough times
maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt?
for whatever its worth i think youre a pretty nice guy too!
also you seem to be the only one who ever thinks to talk to me while im asleep!
why is that?
oh no!!!
dream selves can die?
i never knew that
or even thought about it....
i guess it makes sense though
what!!!!!
see what!
go away
bluhhh what are you talking about....
my head hurts
just stop it, stop trolling me
i hate you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!
about what!
i dont remember talking to you at all
my dream was horrible!!!
i dont know what that was, i have never dreamed anything like it
oh god....
prospit :(
is it really gone?
uuuuuuuuugh D:
oh......
that was you?
argh
sorry but
could you please
not use all those stupid parentheses??????
i can hardly read what you type and its giving me a migraine
what about the -E thing, can you stop that too? it is also annoying and stupid
meh :\
hehehe
ok, sorry for sounding bossy
you seem pretty nice, and you sure do look exotic
i kind of always thought you were all like
a bunch of really obnoxious humans
hey feferi, i would like to remember......
but everything is so foggy right now
i remember prospit being attacked
and
falling.....
aaaand
i dunno :(
do you know what happened?
fffffff
yeah, i gathered that! XC
ohhhhhhh!!!!!
i do remember you!
i remember you were talking to me about my lusus, and i had no idea what you were talking about
and still sort of dont :\
but you must mean bec
also it was shortly before your friend sent me a weird message
about how my robot was going to explode, and i should talk to him when it happens
this was months ago
it was the most awful and angry one
i am so sick of him, i really dont want to talk to that pathetic jerk ever
thats his name?
hmmmm
thats right, it was about some kind of plan...
which he said me from the future told him about?
i thought it was total nonsense at the time
but
i guess he was telling the truth
so maybe i should talk to him? i dont know
ewwwww
ewwwwwwwwwwww!
fish aliens are weird
ok feferi, it was nice talking to you
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i am never going to sleep again!
never never never never never never
yes, im so tired
:(
well, ok
bye
ok, my robot exploded
now what smart guy!
i knew i would regret this
talking to you is so terrible
its making my headache worse
uuuugh shut uuuuup!
will you just tell me what you wanted?
i cant believe i fell for this
it was just a setup to troll me some more
why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it
thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word
and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!
you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont
aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!
i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me
and that is really really shitty!!!!!!
i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever
bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!
yes
as if my day needed another reason to get worse
what does that mean!
is this another prank
you are seriously the worst at pranks
:|
oh jeez, why am i doing this
this is so stupid!
bluhhh youre so funny!!!!!
are you enjoying yourself karkat?
well obviously i know some things youve said are true
its just hard to take everything at face value when youre always so nasty!
ok i understand that you are another group of players and you are in some sort of trouble
but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you
and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours
it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn!
uh huh
sure karkat, whatever you say!
aaauugh what the hell!!!
i cant take this anymore!!!!!!!!
i dont even know what im reading here but its preposterous and ive had it!
i am just so angry, i cant believe i let you push me around all those years
you are completely out of your mind, i was too nice by just blocking you and typing frowny faces and stuff
i should have let you HAVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHUT UP!!!!!!!
future karkat, if you really are future karkat......
where do you get off thinking you can just suddenly act like were pals because you said you apologized????
if you want to apologize then great i am all ears! but just mentioning it off hand and then yelling at yourself the same way you yell at me all the time as if i need a knight to come save me from yourself is so lame, not to mention completely insane
i cant even believe the things im typing here! this is so stupid, talking to two of you at once is the worst thing imaginable
you treat everyone horribly, even yourself, i cant even fathom how awful it is to be you
past karkat, youre acting like a bigger jerk than he is and i think you know that! why dont you take his advice and grow up
as if theres even a real difference between you two. three hours is hardly any time at all, you are the same person YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!
stop it!!!!
ugh, i dont know whats worse, jerk karkat or goofy sycophant karkat
i cant stand it, whether youre trying to be nice or just being a crazy asshole, you are just so weird!!!
im through humoring you, i dont even care about this stupid exploded robot mission, whatever that was
hahaha, FAT CHANCE!!!!
dave wait dont go!
youve got to save me from this insanity :(
i cant wait for future you to future kiss my ass!
i also cant wait for past you to past drop dead and go to hell, PAST TENSE!!!!!!!!
when are those things going to happen?? or will have already past/future happened?????
i want to put another reminder on my finger so i know when its time to throw a party!!!!
jesus will you just ban me already????
my head hurts so bad now i think im going to cry
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa XO
i will just ban myself!!!!
*JADE HARLEY BANNED HERSELF FROM RESPONDING TO THE GRUMPY SHIT HEAD MISERY ZONE, AND IS NEVER COMING BACK*
pchoooooooooooooooo
john are you there???
yes!
im so relieved to talk to you and hear youre ok
i mean.......
are you ok john? your dream self i mean
:(
yes, but that was not prospit. that was its moon which was severed by the crazy derse agent
i dunno!
really?? :D
<3
i dont know! i did not give him one after applying the upgrades
i gave her a girls name when i was very young, but now she is a different bunny, and also a boy i guess?
its up to you john, he is your bunny
hahahaha
again?
you were at roses house??
what!!!!
ugh he is so weird
you shouldnt listen to him!
D:
he is angry and a huge pain in the ass
have you ever talked to two of him at once????
dont ever do it! you will get a headache
noooooooo, think again
????
:|
you mean from armageddon?
john that is so stupid
but also kind of cute i guess
ok then the bunny will be named after your silly movie star fantasy crush
yeah......
that reminds me john
have you looked in the lab yet?
the big room in the sphere at the top of the tower
could you do me a favor and not look in there?
its nothing that secret or personal or anything....
it is just something kind of sad and weird for you to see
it is my dead dream self
it has been there for years, i always knew i would die but i did not realize it would go like this....
what?
oh no!!!!!
im sorry john :(
i understand
ummmmmmm
i think i would rather not talk about that either
you did????
oh nooooooo
john that ring is really important, it belongs to the white queen!
when you go to sleep again, you should try to find it and keep it safe!
yes i have seen it, it is so huge ._.
how much time do you suppose we have?
hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is
but they usually do!
yes, youre right
i dont know...
there are so many possibilities
hmmmmmm!
yes, it sure seems that way
well
maybe you will get that chance john
yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance!
i once dreamt that we would
sure, why not!
that is what i believe this game is for in part
you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave...
dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members
wait, he did????
that is
soooo cooooool :O
i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!!
i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him
we probably have so much to catch up on
i dont see him in his house either :(
oh, ok...
jeez, i feel so out of the loop :(
yes! ok here i go
what!
augh, nooooooooooooooo
oh god, dont get me started :|
he was a strange and silly man
hmmmmmmm, perhaps
is that allowed?
yes, thats a good idea
it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted
he called it the typheus minion
i always hated it!
i guess so
it is probably a coincidence though
yeah maybe.....
i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster
well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with!
:p!!!!!!
joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy
YEAH RIGHT
now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better....
but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer
after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P
maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine!
oh???
:O
omg
john that is incredible
i cant wait to make stuff like that!!!!!!
except...
all my awesome stuff exploded with my room :(
yay!!!
what is the problem!!!!
yes
nice!
how much time?
D:
john, try to be more careful!
um.....
what?
dave!
are you busy?
i dont have much time!
i am about to make my entry item, and its a little confusing
i think the more players we add, the trickier they are to... um......
activate!
like yours was
i figured we could brainstorm about it, while john fusses with the kernel
helloooooo?
:o
:\
whaaat....?
dammit dave!!!!!!
this is really urgent!
._.
oh.............
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
but youre a troll
and thats what trolls do!
even when they say they wont
sometimes especially!!!!!!
ok.....
even though i still have no idea what youre talking about
whats a lusus!!!!!
:\
ok feferi. what is it?
i dont understand
whats a dream bubble?
ugh
feferi i thought you said you were going to stop using your typing quirk!
i dont know... im sure i remember you said that
oh
yeah it is
i dont know what i was thinking....
i just had a major case of deja vu!
i felt like we already had this conversation
actually
it still sort of feels that way
its not going away :o
ummm
what do you mean i never explained it to you?
if this really is the first time we talked, why would i have?
XO
feferi that one was a stretch even by your fish punnery standards
aaah why do i know that you like to make fish puns???
actually
i do remember this conversation
it was in the past!
but if it was in the past, then where am i now?
so what is going on?
i dont think i am asleep....
i am not on prospit
oh...
vaguely
so this is a dream?
sorry
i think
i am in the game now, right?
um
why are you here!
are you asleep too?
oh yeah
i do remember that
then why are you here now?
hey!!!!!
last time i talked to you i was asking for help and you were just nakking at me
what was up with that bro???
you did?
ohhhhhhh
yes, i did get around during that battle didnt i?
it was really intense!!!
those stupid things are impossible to kill :(
in the heat of the fray i didnt notice you!
where were you?
yeah im fine, thanks for asking!
what do you mean you remember seeing me?
was i jumping through time or something?
youre from the future?
:p
john told me you have been doing some time traveling
that is.....
really really awesome!
i knoooooow
it is a really neat place but its freeeeezing :o
wait!
dave!!
uuugh stupid lousy cool dudes
an hour?
:O
i can not believe how cool that is
this is me believing neither that, nor its coolness :O
hmmmm...
i dont know if i get that but ok!
i will?
ok........
but anyway youre right, its coooold!!!!!!
i have to go back inside
i wish i had winter clothes
and if i did, i ALSO wish that my wardrobifier didnt blow up with all of my beautiful clothes inside it :C
im so horribly unprepared for this.... i have never even seen snow before, can you believe that!!!
derp yes dave that is so where i lived
that is as biographically accurate as it gets about me!
no???
isnt it great?????
lava is NOT better than snow :|
you cant play in lava, its no fun
you can only die in lava
eww dave no
no this is so lame
i am hearing an insane and stupid guy say stupid idiot things while wearing dumb sunglasses for lame morons!
heheheh
why dont we play in the snow later
as soon as you get some....................................
..............................
...................
..........
...............
.......
....
...
..
.
time 8)
i know youre joking around, you are not too cool at all, you dont even think that
brrrrrr
i forgot :\
i cant!!!
all that stuff blew up
its a long story that involves a pinata and a gun and a very naughty doggie
so anyway, that reminds me ive got to talk to john!
ive got to get him to make me some new gizmos...
assuming thats even possible
john has magic cyclone powers?
whoa....
you guys are all so much better than me, i feel sooooo lame
heehee
maaaybe
:)
oh no
did he lose it in a magic cyclone?
we do?
doing what??
yes
oh jeez, a few hours????
fastest hours :o
but that costs so much grist!!!
omg...
what does this thing do?
on the back of cards?
but
we can already read those!
hmm
but isnt the whole point of captchas that only humans can read them?
and not robots???
anti spam?
yeah obviously!
oh nooo
whats the good news?
dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here
oh....
to give it to john?
but...
you are already roses server player!
and john is mine!
not to mention im yours!!!
can you really be a server player to your own server player?
but i guess
i thought that john sort of.....
HAD to be my server? you know?
well youre from the future right?
dont you know already if itll work?
pretty smooth dave
shades for everybody
8) 8)
so you will be the server for BOTH us ladies???
you just keep getting smoother, i cant handle all this smoothness
ohh...
i guess that makes sense
ok i think i understand that!
yessss thanks dave <3
um
what do you mean rose will check out? :\
uhhhh ok
it does doesnt it
how long?
ok thats not THAT long :p
yaaaaaaaaaaaay!
oh hi!
i remember you, you talked to me a lot in my dreams
yup!
thats because my dream self died
pretty catastrophically!
thanks, but i think im ok
i felt pretty shaken up at first though
yeah i have done a lot of sleeping myself :)
wow why did you sleep so much???
oh no what happened that was so terrible?
ok sorry for prying!
what did you want to talk about?
permission for what?
with bec?
uh....
what do you mean by commune?
and
what do you mean the first time!
you did it before?
ohhh
like a psychic power??
pretty sweet!
when did you do it before?
hehe what?
omg......
that wasnt a senior interloper, im pretty sure youre talking about my grandpa!!!
and if im interpreting correctly....
youre saying you used bec to make me shoot him???
augh thats so awful!
oh boy
ok it is basically an old man, who serves the same role as i guess a lusus does on your planet?
he was like my dad, he took care of me!
sigh...
well im not blaming you or anything
it sounds like you were just trying to help
and you did save my life
but......
i mean jeeeez
talk about a misunderstanding
uh
sure?
.... it is?
oh nooo
how did that happen?
:|
ummm what kind of device?
oh you mean a wheelchair!
how...
did that happen?
D:
im so sorry
um also
i didnt realize you were paralyzed
not that im saying sorry for that! that would be rude i think
i am just saying sorry for your loss
oh?
wow nice!
um
that.....
i dont know if i agree with that!
well
thats good i guess
i just wish...
maybe you'd told me what happened when i was younger?
i spent years wondering about it!
when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it
and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!!
she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time
but of course i got older and realized that was silly, but then i just speculated that maybe it was suicide
which was just a really sad thing to think about!!!
buuuut...
even if you do, i dont remember you doing so!
er
ok :\
.......
woooooow...
you sound really confused to me!
heheheh
youre incredibly silly
i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here!
rufio?
what do you mean fake?
ohh like an imaginary friend....
heh, ok
that
sure is a philosophy you have there!
oh??
well, what is it?
yes
sure!
red feelings?
you mean
whoooooaaaaaa
wait
really? :o
um.................
well
i dont think i can reciprocate!
i mean
youre nice
but i dont really know you...
i dont even know your name!
ok tavros
i dont know if youve fully thought about this!
you dont actually know me very well either
well no
i was being nice
because
i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me
but......
things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations!
i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming...
i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real
dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit?
sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you...
but i dont know what else to say
jeeeeeez, um...
tavros i am really flattered you like me and all
and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut...
i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess?
i aaaalso think...
and really this is just polite friendly advice!
that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time
it...
oh man im sorry to say
it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose!
and all things considered i think we should just stay friends
or really........
continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well!
sorry :C
aaaah no! you should have self respect
just...
oh boy this is frustrating
can we talk about this later?
i have some things to do!
why dont we get back to the original point
why do you want to commune with bec again?
uh-ohhh
what is your idea this time?
wow, i dunno about that!
but hes my best friend!!!
and you have already managed to get one of my family members killed
but all of our adversaries have inherited his powers!
i would imagine the strongest guy would have all of his powers, and then some!!!
i am really not comfortable with this
you said you are asking me permission first and i appreciate that
but if you are asking im afraid my answer is no!
what?
no way!
that would be smug and arrogant and would make you a bully!!!
later if my friends and i want to ask bec for help and decide thats our best hope, then thats our business
until then, just please stop meddling!!!!!!
nooooooooo dont dont dont dont dont
im serious
uuuuggghh i think my headache is coming back
no...
its fine
i just really dont want you to do that ok?
i have to go now
bye tavros
it is the prettiest tree i have ever seen!!!!!
ok great!
everything about that makes total sense
ok
is this conksucky enough
<3
well...
i am not even sure if i am technically a u.s. citizen!
which one were you again?
wait
werent you the guy who was always trying to hit on me??
uh...
but
im the wwitch!
i mean witch
rose?
i do not have a score to settle with rose!!!
why would you think that?
i think you are projecting your own attitude on to others
just because you tend to hate and/or hit on everyone you meet doesnt mean everyone else is that way
rose just sent me a code for a crystal ball, shes my friend and is basically the best!
wait do you have a thing for her too???
did she reject you or something?
:|
uh huh...
wow what are you talking about
hey look at that, time for me to get going!
no i dont want it!!!!!
more like a legendary piece of shit!
yes but i dont like you very much and i feel really icky about accepting a present from you
siiigh
fine
what?
oh...
hmmm...
i have seen this before
i am very sure its the same rifle included with johns present
but...
bigger of course
yes but....
i did not provide the weapons!
my penpal did
the guy who helps me build the present
we worked on it together but he supplied the bunnys weapons
im pretty sure hes from the future!
because he said hes my grandson
umm yes
oh no!!!!!
aaaaa please dont tell anyone i told you about him!
augh how could i let that slip to you of all people
wow ok!!!!
i wasnt going to say anything
he didnt want me to tell my friends who he really was
i guess maybe he was concerned about upsetting the timeline? i dunno
maybe!
i have wondered about that, assuming he is right...
he was so nice, and it really did feel like i was talking to family, so i really dont think he was making it up
i couldnt help but try to imagine his parents...
and more interestingly.......
his grandfather :O
i still wonder who it could be...
although i guess at this point
the options are pretty limited :o
like an heirloom? i guess it could be
do you even have those? if you dont have parents how could you?
ewwwwwwww
hmmmm
then maybe that is how this heirloom should work
well i dont want to use it!
so ill just dump it outside the house with the trash
and if it is fated to find my penpal one day then so be it!
maybe you should have been nicer to me!
in any case i dont appreciate the spirit in which the gift was given so this is what i will do!
dave!!!!!!
any dave out there please listen!
dave i just saw you, and you were dead!
you were in a green suit and covered in blood, oh god it was terrible :(
if that was a future dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!!
oh
i am confused :o
ok...
i am still not sure i get that!
but i guess i am relieved?
wheeeew! there i just was
how did that poor dave die?
was it jack?
D:
what about your...
um....
oh no i dont even know if you know about this
;_;
is it something you would like to talk about
ghost dad???
oh...
yes he mentioned something about it
i guess i didnt realize its full implications....
but time was short when we talked!
ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him
its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D:
anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad
you were pretty close with him right?
heheh
sure
dave we have to stop him!!!!!
jack!
he shouldnt get away with this
yes
why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??
oh :(
what is the scratch?
really??
hmmmm...
so was that like a hint?
about what im supposed to do :D
well maybe im just being naive...
but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!
are you suuuure we cant beat him?
i dont know if we should rule it out!
ok
thanks dave!
hey tavros!
i was thinking about your plan
about uh...
"communing" with my lusus :)
maybe its not a bad idea!
are you there?
hmm, i guess you are off doing something else
oh well, hope youre doing ok....
talk to you later!
karkat!!!!!
yes
im going crazy here
i never thought id say this, but im actually almost relieved to talk to you
or really ANYBODY besides that lunatic
SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!!
are you joking??? look at this mess!
okay...
i made the mistake of prototyping my dream self who has been dead for years
and shes completely crazy and theres no talking any sense into her
hmm?
hmm what
:\
what are you getting at???
well...
i mean, i understand why she is upset
but she is completely inconsolable, and wont listen to reason about anything!
and i guess i could deal with that but...
the frustrating thing is that shes actually me :(
i really dont think i would act like that
will you stop saying hmm!!!!!!
fascination?
what do you find so fascinating?
my feelings?
well...
at first i was sad
because she made me remember all the sad things that just happened
but im trying to be strong about all that so we can keep moving forward
and if i can then why cant she?
but she just went on and on
and i started getting angry...
ugh i have never been so angry in my LIFE!!!
I SAID STOP SAYING FUCKING HMM
what does THAT mean?????
is that supposed to be someone with a halo and goofy teeth?
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?
oh
haha oops
yeah, pretty much
considering what??
oh come on...
this is NOTHING like that!
because she's...
well
she's ACTUALLY INSANE
but
those are you
im not her!
i dont know
it just...
...
oh my god
youre right :(
so then i guess
im a hypocrite :(
wait...
so me arguing with my dead dream self
and smacking her around while screaming at her
makes me SANE???
hahaha, wow
you are so weird
you want me to apologize?!
for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself???
after taking so much crap from you for all those years?
no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT
shut uuuup!!!
what
are you saying you want to apologize
ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again!
maybe your "present self" should own up to it!
laaaaame
hahahaha, that is so ridiculous
why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally?
:o
hmmmm...
yes, hm
ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me
and youre right, i dont actually know you
i just know the part of you who acted like a bully
i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry
so i will accept your apology and give you another chance
and i will apologize for calling you crazy
obviously i am not in much position to judge :|
so you say you have been talking to me from the future?
ok, so what is the plan?
i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly?
yes
ok, i can do that
but why, what does it do?
its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out
i dont think im following...
you were told?
by who?
oh...
future me?
uh... ok
well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me!
hey!!!
oh yeah! dave told me about that.
what is it?
ok then...
what was the thing i told you to tell me to do?
right now, i mean
ok
then what
draw it?
and then?
password!
I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!!
whoops sorry
ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p
well......
it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation?
both are!
but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be
so we can have one right now if you want
in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already!
but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........
PASSWORD :P
nope!
because i told you
exactly!!!!!!!!!!!
hehehe
yum :B ??????????????????????
hmm, i suppose those are acceptable
to keep the conversations linear!
i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation
you have to give me that password to start our next conversation
this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now!
i know, but trust me its better this way :)
i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from!
but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation
and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since!
bye kanaya <3
thanks i think!
what do you mean by pre blackout rose?
umm, ok...
but what do you mean by blackout???
hmm @_@
im doing what you told me to do!
im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment
so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about
which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :(
oh
what is a sylph?
a magical witch???
thats awesome
breeding duties?????
uhhhhhhhhh...
please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like!
it sounds like
it involves
a lot of breeding :\
oh
does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it?
ok then, thats pretty neat
yeah, whew <_<;
how so?
what is your role?
whoa, cool!
so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns
:o
errr.......
yes 8|
what!
you think so?
i think you can do it!
yes...
didnt you say your lusus was a grub?
thats perfect!
if you were raised by a mother grub, then you are in a great position to raise one yourself
it is like...
a sort of family legacy!
a really cool alien family legacy
dont mention it!
so how does this cloning stuff work?
i want to try anyway!
if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left
yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower
didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place?
my house is freezing now
it ran on geothermal power before...
and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet
yes i would like to hear about that later...
but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium!
lets see how dave is doing.....
its...
so small :o
but
clone babies can barely even fit on that thing!
i mean young humans!!!
you know, that we milk producers nurture hatchless within?
then what is the objective?
what am i breeding????
:O
i cant get over how tiny this thing is!
its so cute
so the baby frogs show up on this pad here?
i cant wait to try it
oh
lol
dave just has a lot of funny stuff to say about all this
oh you know, a bunch of silly stuff
theres too much to copy/paste!
here ill save it all to a file and send it to you
hahaha
alright how do i get started!
ok, here is a frog on the screen
on no, is it trapped in ice?
was your planet covered in ice too?
cool!
anyway, i will try to rescue this frog
so i push this button to appearify it?
ok........
oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!!
this will not do
i dont understand!
but i am intrigued...
ok, that makes sense i think
how can i appearify some frog slime?
so it is like
a sort of backwards frog breeding
clone first, catch later?
ok, i will try this
heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky
he looks frozen solid too
so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???
that sounds like fun!!!!!!!
hmmmmm
k hang on while i clone this fella.....
yaaaaaay!!!
i will think of something...
i wont let the poor little guy suffocate!
so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones?
it is?
huh...
so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?
am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?
sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O
oh!
why?
him?
so he is a boy frog?
the speaker?
hehehe
CROOOOOOAK
then the speaker is like a god, but there are a lot of them?
like one for each session, kind of like the kings and queens?
it is pretty catchy...
if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense!
thats good
ok then what?
what do we do after i make this big god froggy?
does it have something to do with the new universe we create?
you said he was a genesis frog
does that mean we bring him into the universe and...
he makes new planets or life or such?
really???
yes i got that!
you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?
but your species is too!
especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic
but i dont do that!
i try to say what i mean as much as i can
from what?
haha, you mean from rose?
yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!
they inculcate that stuff like crazy
so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?
are you best friends now??
why?
oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?
what the heck does that mean!
yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!
you did???????
yeah! :D
jeez, i hope not...
me too!!!!!
wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common
well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature
i can understand that
are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?
you mean your guardian?
uh oh...
im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous
she didnt mention anything about this when we talked
but then she seemed preoccupied
yeah, i will!
lol yeah i guess so!
ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...
theres still so much i want to know!
i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!
yes! <3
if i have cause to?
oh!!!
that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear
yeah! i guess someone told you?
aaaaa you see??????
you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!
i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...
i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from
ok lets put the system in play starting now!
i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again
the password is...............
CROOOOOOOOOOOAK
it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!
whoops!
eleven then :p
kanaya :o
that sounded
just a weeeeeee bit
sarcastic ;D
you are just becoming multicultural, thats all
i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well
it mostly involves saying fuck a lot
heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad
ok! go hatch that orb!
i will be waiting
later!
john!!! :D
wow, finally!
nope!
dave was able to set up as my server player
he is building up my house right now so that we can deploy some equipment up there
yep!
:o
thats ok, i wont tell him about it
well, maybe you can.....
i will try to put in a good word for you B)
im not sure!
something to do with cloning i guess? it serves some purpose in my quest as witch of space
a nice troll named kanaya has been advising me on stuff about that
have you talked to her?
you should!
a bunch of trolls are not nearly as bad as i thought
even karkat! he has been helping me too... sort of, hehe
oh yeah, he said plenty of stuff like that, but i dont think he ever actually meant it
flying off the handle is part is of his charm in a funny way, once you know that about him
heheheh
shhhhhhhhh
yeah!
hmm what else... theres been so much going on, its been a little hard to keep track of it all!
why dont you tell me what youve been up to first?
..............
whoa :O
john where did you get that nice flying car??????
sort of!
she gave me the code, and i made a cool pair of goggles with it
it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car
and your chauffeur familiar, i guess?
you did???
:(
hmmmmm...
maybe, but hang on let me try something
yes!
what have you seen?
:O
like what, what did you seeeee?
frogs?
no...
sure does!
nope! but that sounds pretty interesting
i wonder why i would be surrounded by frogs?
hahaha thats true!
i hope i am not planning on putting them in a cauldron or anything o_o
whew!
bluh. yes :|
i prototyped my dead dream self and tried to get her to fight jack
but it turned out to be a BIG MISTAKE
god i cant believe how dumb that idea was, she was an emotional wreck
oh, she went off to cry somewhere else... good riddance!
hehe i guess so
what!!!!!
oh noooo
who?
i dont think so!
well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree
what process?
and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused
ohhhhhh!
that makes sense
dave had mentioned you reached the god tier
but he did not say what it involved D:
he probably didnt want to make me worried
or that!
but he also said that no one else would do it but you...
actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead
its too bad really
i wonder what space powers would be like??
oh well
!!!
youre right...
i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :(
DX
i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly.
why dont you tell me about your new friend?
he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
haha! what is he doing with that!
probably!
you are just going to have to deal with the fact that you are becoming a famous hero john, and people everywhere will idolize you
:o
thats great! john you have to get that ring from him!
hmmmmmmmmmm
that is a problem!
you do?
and what?
8O
ok john.....
i trust you
so i will trust in your trust in him
im going to be a supportive piece of shit all day and fall down all this trust!
lol
john, i already found your dad!
yes i found him with my goggles almost right away!
but i didnt want to interrupt you
he is with roses mom
they are in a castle, having some sort of tea party together
they appear to be enjoying each others company!
its quite adorable actually
RED ALERT!!!!!!
AWOOOOOOOOOOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
durrrr oh really john :p
but really, they make a nice couple and i think it would be great if they got married!
i guess so
yes they are pretty special
i dunno
who are they to stand between two youngsters in love?
yes john, two people must be in love in order to get married
it is one of the rules!
so what do you say john, are you in love with rose?
and if not, are you prepared to fall in love with her?
wellllll? :D
i didnt even know karkat made a shipping diagram...
i will have to make him show me
<_<;
whaaat...
i dont know about that!
i clearly need to take a good hard look at this prophetic document
and possibly tell karkat what an idiot he is!
uh
well, i dont actually know where he is relative to you!
so i dont know if i can give you directions
there might be some way to do that...
these goggles are actually REALLY COMPLICATED!
i will look into it and get back to you
in the meantime, why dont you fly around and keep looking?
at least now you know to look for a castle
and maybe the clouds will give you some more tips!
sure! <3
later!
ummmmmm hey guys i hope im not interrupting!!!
oh no!
i can leave
:o
its ok! i can take another nap later when you guys arent busy...
well...
i have just been enjoying these little naps more and more lately!
each time i go to sleep i meet more new people and learn so much
but i still cant get karkat to take a nap, boy talk about a guy who is anti nap!
seeeeeriously!
he is the douchiest of crabby crabs who ever douched a big douchey crab
but yeah, its been fun, i should really thank feferi again for setting it up so we could meet like this!
yup!
ummm probably in another bubble
but youll find her! maybe during your next nap...
yeah!
you were really nice and helpful
i think your outfit looks so cute! i love your wings too
i am not sure :o
what!
i am ready!
yay!
wait! before we do...
hi kanaya! it is nice to meet you
you dont like it???
yes i know you told me!
yes but you probably havent yet
not from your perspective..... i could not help but overhear you are asleep now
you told me all about what happened after you woke up!
about how you turned into a vampire
isnt that daves puppet?
:\
bye!
guys why do you have daves puppet?
what is going on here!
rose jeez!!!
finally
you sure seem to be absorbed in whatever youre doing on that computer...
were you talking to someone?
oh no no i dont blame you for not responding!
you must be very upset
are you ok?
um
because
uhhh i figured you would have found out by now but i guess you still dont know?
about...
johns dad
and.......
your mom :(
rose?
hello???
oh noo :'(
rose please say something
you are making me nervous...
umm
because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation?
i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it
john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!
and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?
i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...
argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(
whew, ok
you know...
now we have all lost guardians
dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\
and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians
i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes
......
i am so sad
rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am
oh
well
i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash
yeaaah...
errrr, i dont know?
wellllll
no!
but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope
hm
then what will you do?
what does that mean!
oh no no no no no!
rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!
he would probably kill you!
i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it
what? who?
aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????
rose who is this!
i dont even know whats going on anymore
SHHHHHHHHHH!
please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight
nooo :(
rose, maybe white text guy is right?
the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...
but what if they are not actually good?
no...
but i still dont trust them!
whats this weirdo talking about!
oh yeah
i noticed you found it!
i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up
is he saying you can use it?
omg
does it work???
then maybe you should try it!
well
since we dont know much about the gods...
why dont you ask it about them?
i guess that is a way to put it
john!!! i am worried about rose!
im pretty sure she is on her way there to look for jack!
i cant say for sure because i cant see her with my goggles anymore for some reason, but i am fearing the worst
just in case, you should to try to intercept her before she does something stupid like try to fight him!!!!!
also, um...
i guess you probably still dont know about your dad yet do you?
darn, why do i always have to be the one to break terrible news :(
er
john?
oh god please dont tell me your computer was in the wallet you just gave that guy.....
dammit john!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one of these days you will learn the value of having plenty of backup computers
in fact whenever you finally leave the battlefield i am going to give you the code for a nice pair of lunchmuffs
and then i am going to force you to keep them on your head AT ALL TIMES!
yeah, youre never going to read this are you :|
pw.
listen fuckass
i am going to need a password before we continue
plz <3
....................... :|
no karkat, that was not quite the password
but you were on the right track :p
do you even remember the right password?
youre being deliberately dumb
it was...
IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF?
remember?
i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez.
i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system?
why would i want to do that??
the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!
i have this on good authority from both sources
you see, that is your problem
okay, one of your many, many problems...
you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!
even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before
it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing
so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!
its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out
exactly :D
ok
yes
yes, we still are!
this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.
i can understand her just fine!
we already talked about this
echidna and i have an understanding now ;)
well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly
you might have actually learned something!!!!!!
did you ever talk to kanaya about it?
her situation was very similar to mine
it doesnt sound like you got the whole story
or maybe you just werent listening to her :p
this was kanayas suggestion
yes!
im talking to her right now actually
durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius
a few hours in your future!
you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you
she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all
it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!
yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!
but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask
siiign, what are you even talking about?
aw
well...
youll find him
i know, i made an exception
but only one!
kanaya thinks we should all talk about this
she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy
:x!!!!!
she is opening a memo
yeah...
its ok though. as long as he is tailing me like a lost puppy, at least hes not killing anybody
i remember the episode!!!
but hes ok now
and im kind of starting to think that was just his way of saying hi
my dog used to fetch my bullets too!
i really think he believes he is my dog, on some level
dont worry, im keeping my eye on him
aaaaaa no no no, bad jack, bad!!!!!!
yeah...
the poor froggies :(
youre probably right, they really seem to drive him crazy
this is not the first time i have had to reprimand him
he was growling at echidna and i had to tell him he was being very bad
he destroyed some of her really nice statues too
keeping him in line really makes me miss bec, he was such a good dog
not to mention a best friend
jack is just...
exactly
huh?
but you are a programmer arent you? that is at least kind of like being a scientist, having some technical savvy...
we know! you are clearly very good at being all of those things
but now we need your help with frog science. can you help us?
shhhhhhhshhhshhshshsh.....
SHOOSH
no future talk!!! lets stay on topic
kanaya means she is a very pretty girl with pointy fangs who has a bright sunny complexion and wears fancy dresses
and...
she drinks blood >_>
hee hee
yup :)
karkat...
that information qualifies as..........
FUTURE STUFF!
no wait! just please listen a little longer?
not exactly...
she just helped me remember
something from my past
if i accepted her terms
yeah because you never told me yours!!!
hmm
yeah she made me promise to do something that sounds impossible too
except......
i actually agreed :o
i have no idea how im going to keep my side of the bargain, now that i think about it
oh right
where the last frog is!
or was...
the thing is
the frog we need is nowhere to be found in the medium
it was on earth!
but only very briefly
it was when i was young
before i woke up on prospit
i had begun sleep walking
both on the island and on the moon
and in my dream it was very bright
i saw something in the light
i couldnt tell what it was so i got closer
but before i got there i woke up
and found myself by the lagoon surrounding the ruins
i was about to walk home
when i saw something appear on a lily pad
it was a frog!
an amazing shiny frog, not like any other ive seen in the lagoon
it hopped over to me and i picked it up
but then, just like that...
it died
later my grandpa made a robot for me to help me with my sleep walking
it could do all the walking while i stayed safe in bed!
it could also record my dreams
i am sure he always knew my dreams were going to be special
i suspect he knew it before i was even born
hopefully!
no, it completely slipped my mind
well, like it was before
the choices she gives you seem to have to do with facing mortality
and making it clear if you choose one path over another it will lead to your death
and that your death may even be necessary to accomplish a goal
yeah
but
that is not really what made this hard
i mean
nobody wants to die of course
but at least...
that is a clear thing
you either do you you dont
you know?
it might be
she said
that if i accepted her help
that i would have to make a promise
that whenever we left this place
and wherever we end up going
she had to come
not just echidna but all the denizens
their palaces their consorts their lands...
everything
i have to bring them all with us
oh sorry!
i was distracted
no not by all the scratchy stuff in the sky
theres something coming down...
its hard to make out
but
i think
it might be...
shaving cream?
its like
hey!
...
karkat?
Oh, that's fine!
I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.
Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!
As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.
I talked to him yesterday. That's as much help as I can be!
Hoo hoo.
I love that thing. :B
What do you need with him?
Does this have to do with your crazy pen pal project?
Sorry, J. :(
This would be the birthday present... for your grandmother?
Her and me.
"A joint gift from her and me." Grammar, Jake!
So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?
You are a very strange and silly boy.
Well,
Godspeed, then! I do hope you can pull it off.
No!!
Hey! I have believed in you too.
However, believing somebody isn't the same thing as believing IN somebody.
But that much said...
I think that maybe I am getting ready to believe some of the wild stories I've heard?
Or, if not believe outright, reserve judgment on, at least.
I don't know!
I'm still not sure what to think. But what I wanted to tell you this morning was...
I had a really wild dream last night.
And you were in it.
Sh! Not like that.
It was so real! I think we were in the game, even though we haven't started playing yet.
I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.
Um...
Not a heck of a lot!
I really want to tell you all about it, but it will take some time to explain, and we both have things to attend to.
You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!
Yes, ok, good luck Jake!
Why, hellooooooo.
:B!
Gosh! So formal today.
D'aww.
You needn't worry about easing my nerves.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be nearly as thrilled about today as I am!
That is reassuring!
No, I haven't seen her online yet today.
I'm really hoping Lalonde won't flake out on me this time. Have you heard from her?
If you say so.
Oh!
I wanted to tell you, I had an amazing dream last night!
I believe it may have been of the sort you described. A dream of awakening, presuming I haven't just flatout lost my marbles.
I was in a bright gold city. Above was a brilliant blue sky, but the horizon was dark as night.
Was this the place you told me about? What was it called...
Ah, shucks, does this count as a "causal spoiler?"
I didn't see you there. At least, I don't think I did!
Ok then.
I mentioned this briefly to Jake, and he didn't have much to say before we parted ways.
I will gather that if this is all true, then it means Jake had not awoken yet?
I don't know.
But there was one thing about the dream that was very troubling.
I'm becoming nervous to consider what it might mean.
Hrm. I'm still not sure I appreciate what that means, but I appreciate that a nice gesture has been made if you say so!
I guess I should just start believing all of this now, huh? Rather than learning it to be true later and feeling the fool for all my curmudgeonly skepticism?
For starters, I guess I could drop my reservations about your story?
I can write off much to tomfoolery as I'm no stranger to a good prank myself. But quite honestly you seem too kind for this charade. Not the type I'd expect to trot out such persistent falsehoods beyond their humorous welcome.
So what do I know! Consarn it, maybe you are an alien girl from Uranus, and together we are about to play a game which determines the fate of existence. Sign me up!
Omg.
Overreact much? I kept you waiting for all of two seconds!
Where have you been today?
"All of a sudden."
This hit you just now? We made plans to get in touch early this morning, and I have seen neither hide nor hair of you all day.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Grrr.
Now I know you're joking around to get my goat.
Nooooo, stop. :(
Yeah. Because it's weird!
And you're drunk. :P
I don't see why you don't try to court the favor of Mr. Strider. If you ask me, he and you are perfect for each other.
Lordy.
How can you be this fargone so early?
It isn't even noon yet.
You're three hours ahead of me!
Tsk. What would your mother have to say if she caught you?
So even if your insane and paranoid theory happens to be true, your response is, "Screw it! Time to help myself to all this mind game booze."
Groan. You are completely impossible like this.
I cannot believe you chose to do this today of all days. I should have known better!
Here I am waking up bright and early, waiting all day with my nose pressed against this glass for the mail to come and wondering if you'll ever log on, and all the while you are just getting blind stinking schnocker-bottomed drunk.
&%#$@!!!
The alpha!
Jeez-Louise, you are hopeless.
Are you at all ready to play if it comes?
Not this again.
The "Batterwitch" DOES NOT EXIST!
It is an idiotic urban legend.
How many times have I explained this? My great, great grandmother who founded the company and is accused of holding this identity would have to be almost two hundred years old if she were still alive today. The idea is such preposterous hogwash it's hardly worth dignifying with a rational response.
The iconic face of the company isn't even a real person! She was fabricated long ago during the company's fledgling years.
Such cuckoobird nonsense.
In any case, I don't understand the nature of this second guessing, besides chalking it up to your unwelcome inebriation.
We had agreed you would play with me. You sounded excited about it!
Have you even obtained your copy yet??
Through your various technologically crypotgraphic means, I presume?
:|
I am quizzically narrowing my eyes trying to solve the joke you are attempting, assuming it even is one.
Oh.
Really?
Hrm. That is a bit puzzling. I thought this software was highly proprietary.
Ump, yes, I know. You've made yourself clear.
But what doesn't add up about your story is,
I believe SOMEBODY doesn't want me to play.
How else do you explain the recent attempts on my life?
"there"
So this hypothetical monstrosity wants me to succeed, but also wants me to die?
Makes a lot of sense!
I see. This is sounding less like a crackpot conspiracy theory by the minute!
Hm. It's tempting, and I'm curious as heck to play it.
But the mail should be coming any minute! I've waited this long for it, so I might as well use the official discs addressed to me.
When it comes, I do hope you'll change your tune.
Not to mention brew yourself a pot of coffee and sober your drunk butt up.
Hoo hoo! Ok, fair enough.
But I believe that when we start playing together, you'll come around.
Personally, I can hardly contain my excitement over it.
If years ago someone told me, which incidentally someone DID, that today I would have an exclusive opportunity to play what is absolutely the most cutting edge immersive simulation game ever released, developed by a company which has already done so much for the advancement of humanity, I would have said, "Shucks, buster, sign me up!"
Yes?
What!
Shoosh you, drunky! :B
Oh...
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
The thing.
The flappy thing!
THE FLAPPY SWINGY DOODAD.
THE ARM DEALIE.
THE DEALIE, LALONDE, THE DEALIE!!!
THE GODDARNED RED SWINGY FLAPPY LEVER ARM THINGAMABOB, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.
ON THE MAILBOX.
IT'S UP.
IT'S UP, IT'S UP, IT'S UP.
NO, WHO CARES ABOUT THAT! THE DEALIE, THE DEEEEEAAAALIEEEEEEE!!!
IT'S UP, IT'S UP, IT'S HERE IT'S HERE IT'S HERE!
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
Brb.
Oh, that's fine!
I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.
Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!
As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.

You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!
Yes, ok, good luck Jake!
J, how goes the bunnyquest?
Tell me about it.
Dad has the whole house in full fatherly lockdown mode. Talk about blowing a few measly "assassination attempts" way out of proportion!
So I'm currently mulling over my next move.
What is it that has you hamstrung? Did you ever track down the slippery Mr. Strider?
Sounds dangerous!
Why is it that our two best friends in the world always seem to place themselves at the source of all our problems, while simultaneously presenting their only solutions?
I'm debating whether or not to enlist his help in the matter of my current imprisonment. But I'd rather keep it as a plan of last resort.
We'll see.
So I take it you're out and about now?
Right. Well, not to keep you too long, since we both still have our missions ahead of us, but I wanted to tell you about that dream I had.
Hoo. :B
Ok, but, I should say that the nature of the dream was a bit worrisome.
And I'm concerned it may have implications for the game we're about to play.
So it's probably best that I tell you about it before you leave.
I woke up on the planet which we have been told about by our mutual acquaintance.
The one covered in golden cities. Prospit, remember?
Yes, you're right. It was the moon, actually. I could see the planet on the dark horizon.
I was dressed in a golden dress, like a sort of nightgown, and I could fly. I left my bedroom, which was at the top of a tall tower. Surrounding me were the gold cities, just as described.
Behind the skyline was darkness. But just above was a bright blue sky and puffy white clouds.
Yes, probably.
Are you sure you haven't woken up there before?
I see. The impression I have developed is that this is supposed to be a real place, and all who dream there have shared experiences.
Did Jade ever mention seeing us there?
Hrmm. Anyway...
I explored the moon, and began to notice people gathering in the streets.
But they weren't human. They were funny looking, perfectly white creatures.
Well, I don't know if they had much to do with chess here.
The more closely I observed, the more they appeared somewhat despondent.
Yes.
I determined they were in mourning, actually.
Shoosh! I'm getting there.
More and more Prospitians were filing out of the buildings every moment.
They all began to form a single, major procession.
When I got closer, I could see that some were in tears.
I realized this was a funeral.
I heard whispers, but couldn't make out what they were saying, so I got closer.
They were all saying the same thing, over and over.
"The Page is dead."
"Our hope is lost."
Jake.
The Page was you.
Yes, I saw your body lying in a sort of coffin, on a bed of flowers. You were dead as a doornail.
Everyone was so distraught!
Including me. :(
But before I could get too horribly upset, let alone make sense of any of it, I woke up.
I of course immediately wanted to tell you all about, but it was still well before sunrise for you, and you were surely still asleep.
Then as the day went on I guess I became distracted by other things. You know how it is.
I hope I'm not too late to "warn" you, though to be frank I don't have the foggiest clue what it is I'm warning you about.
"Dear Jake, oh please do try not to... have already... died in my dream? Likely while you were sleeping, perhaps peacefully?"
Still, I think you'll agree that it's to be viewed as a troubling omen.
I care very much for you, and I don't know what I'd do if I lost you both in my dreams, and here in this world.
So for whatever good it does, just please be extra careful out there today!
Hooray! Will do. ;B
Now let's get this silly old adventure off to the races before the coat of dust it's growing gets any thicker.
Oh, no.
I'm just trying to leave my house!
Is this the real you, btw?
Ok. Just making sure!
Jake was having some issues with it earlier, and I don't think he received its obfuscating tendencies in the humorous spirit intended.
Oh, so you're talking to Jake then?
:B
Was it that bad?
Why not just turn it off then?
Who?
These lectures I presume are roughly similar in complexion to those I'm familiar with?
Those wherein I have, and I quote, "got to be more like Jake?"
I sincerely doubt that I am!
Let's not talk about my "issues" again, shalln't we?
Shush!
The word shalln't escape my vocabulary any longer, just as you SHALLN'T nitpick my language! That's my turf you're on, buster.
What were you saying?
About leaving the responder on!
Jake?
True.
Dialogic?
Are you saying you have conversations with your own auto-responder?
Hrm, that's interesting.
I guess I always thought it was just a really elaborate gag!
Sometimes your sense of humor seems more impenetrably advanced than your robotics. I'll never understand this tapestry of irony you weave.
Maybe I'm just stuck in the dark ages of pranksterism with my funny mustaches corny old joke book.
Is that a note of bitterness directed at your superstar brother I am detecting?
Oh lordy. Yes, yes, I know. I don't need another ironic lesson in science fiction!
Flaws?? Talk about understatement. Those movies are unwatchable.
Unless your name is Jake English.
Ermm...
If you say so!
I dunno. Call me a simpleton, but I just like funny jokes.
Well, aside from thousands of dollars in corpse-repair richer, I can't say.
I can think of cuter places for him to sleep, frankly!
Oh, please.
Anyway, property damage and desecration to cherished elders aside, Mr. Bear has been a lovely addition to the family.
Oh... no.
I keep forgetting I'm supposed to!
Sorry.
I will name him right now!
How about Lil' Sebastian?
Yeah!!!
So then, are you saying Mr. Sebastian here was an ironic present?
Relayed strictly for guffaws?? >:B
Huh?
What! Really? :O
I thought you said you didn't have such an heirloom to complete the plushie trifecta?
Ooh. Risky!
So it's from a movie?
Nope.
Wait...
Wasn't that some bit of action schlock from the 90's?
Some of the silly nonsense referenced in his work was well before my time. I don't have the wherewithal to investigate all this minutia.
That does sound a tad obsessive. Wasn't he furious about your burglary?
Why didn't you mention this when you gave the gift? More irony?
I see. So it was like a private joke, and if anyone besides you was in on it, the joke would be ruined!
D'awwwww.
Wait, real sentiment, or ironic sentiment?
Or is there no difference?? Am I missing the point here?
This is fascinating, if a wee bit more dissertation than I bargained for this morning.
I have so much to learn. And I am not even saying that "ironically!"
Will you teach me your ways one day, sir? Perhaps an apprenticeship will open?
Tempting, but that rain check will have to stay unendorsed for now.
Lil' Seb is beginning to act out, and I must put his fidgetiness to constructive use!
Um, no?
This is news to me. I never gathered that "team leader" was a thing for this game.
Are you sure? I have my doubts.
I believe as a group we will have the temerity to succeed, without my having to order people around like an insufferable bossypants.
Hm?
That's stupid!
Precisely!
There is a BIG difference!
Oh yes?
Then this whole affair will be one of D. Strider's grand productions in puppetry?
These lessons we talked about...
They've already begun, haven't they? :o
Holy moly!
Um, thank you, but no.
I'm not ready to get dialogic with my cyberself just yet. My friends keep me busy enough as it is.
Speaking of which, I really need to go. I know you love to talk my ear off, and it's always a treat, but let's catch up later after the game starts, ok?
And if I do need your help, I promise I'll take you up on your offer!
The one where you, hopefully not literally, offered to catch me in the crevice of a great big squishy butt! Hoo hoo hoo!
Gtg!!! <3
Heyyy.
Ahem.
Ro-Lal?
Oh?
With whom?
Yeah.
Um... which one, precisely?
If the chats and surplus dinners were truly important, I wouldn't want to interrupt.
Actually,
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You see, I was just the target of another assassination attempt.
Two, in fact! One here in the real world, as I attempted to retrieve the mail.
Luckily it was thwarted by a certain cat who shall remain nameless.
But in the process of being rescued from the explosion, I was knocked unconscious.
And in my dream, there was another assassination attempt.
This one I believe was successful!
I'm becoming convinced that our "dream selves" are being picked off by violent hooligans.
Perhaps.
The one who accosted me was a knife-wielding lunatic.
And it's reasonable to deduce the same forces were responsible for Jake's death on Prospit as well.
It looks like we are in the clutches of an actual caper. A real life mystery!
Which under different circumstances would be quite exciting.
But the truth is, I think we are all in great danger!
Yeah, yeah. :p
But that wasn't all there was to the dream.
Shortly before I was stabbed, I had a rather long gander at Skaia.
Yes.
I would say a pretty substantial gander.
I saw things in the clouds.
Yes.
Things.
Things happening in the future, I think.
Many events pertaining to us. All of us, and other people I didn't recognize.
It was a bit overwhelming.
It made me feel small. Insignificant, relative to whatever it is we're about to involve ourselves with.
And honestly...
It made me feel pretty foolish too.
I began to wonder why I ever had the audacity to think I know much of anything about the world we live in or the journey we're about to take.
Or to think I could ever rule anything out.
I have a feeling that whatever I saw, it means you've been telling the truth all along.
About everything.
And I'm starting to feel like a complete idiot for doubting you.
I've been one great big horse's caboose, and I think you're owed an apology.
Do you think you can forgive me?
Why?
I did.
And at this point, I guess I have no choice but to use it. I guess you were a step ahead of me yet again.
Because the one in the mail detonated in my most recent assassination attempt.
:B
Hoo hoo! The tactic was quite underhanded, yes.
I don't blame you.
Where we were, by my estimation, was a place wherein I was about to awkwardly attempt to swallow a helping of humble pie.
To somehow make it up to you for my years of stubborn mistrust.
Hm?
Oh!!!
Oh gosh, what a doofus.
You see?? I clearly don't have all the answers!
I really had some nerve challenging anyone, on practically any subject.
That's fair. But I would still like to make a gesture.
Even if it's one partially motivated by self interest, seeing as I clearly have much to learn.
I would like to give you a free pass for a day.
It is good for twenty-four solid hours of absolute credulity from your best friend.
:B
It means that starting now, whatever you tell me, I will have to believe you.
I promise!
Yes.
Um,
Are you there?
Ro???
Oh.
Hmm.
Exactly how dramatic are we talking, here?
Shall I go retrieve a magazine?
Sigh.
Hmm.
Everything, I guess. I'd like to get completely up to speed, if possible.
Some reiteration certainly couldn't hurt.
But this time I won't work so hard to sift the fantastical from the plausible.
Sure.
Oh, I know that!
That was always something I had no trouble believing, considering the public documentation even reclusive celebrities receive.
And frankly, the family resemblance is obvious.
Anyway, it would be disingenuous if I found your relation far fetched, since we're all apparently related to noteworthy people. It's just one of those funny things.
Maybe we should start at the very beginning.
Do you remember around when we first started talking?
And you claimed you were the one making my pumpkins disappear?
You later proceeded to try to prove to me that what you were saying was true.
But none of your attempts thereafter would ever bear any fruit, pardon the pun.
Yes, I know what pumpkins are. It was a joke, silly.
What I'm trying to say is, in thinking back to those days, when you couldn't verify your claims, it made me think the whole thing was a big ruse.
And I think this unfortunately began a pattern of mistrust. It was always hard to rule out the possibility that you could be joking about other things as well.
I couldn't begin to explain the science behind such a technology either.
But I guess the important thing is, regardless of how or why it works, this is a story you continue to stand by?
That is, you are still taking credit for the mysterious disappearance of all those pumpkins I grew years ago?
...
Did you gank them when my gourd was down?
Very well!
Then I believe that is what happened.
That's all I am trying to say here.
Now... nothing, really.
You may continue to tell me anything you would like with the confidence that I won't doubt you.
So by all means, go ahead!
Oh, come on!
That is a question!
It's not any sort of revelation, or statement for me to take at face value.
Dadburn it. This isn't that difficult!
And for the record, it's not great.
GETTING STABBED BY A BAD GUY. IT ISN'T ALL THAT PEACHY.
So, you're not in the mood to tell me things?
Um...
Madrigogs?
Yeah, I understand.
It's not about pity!
It's more like a gesture I'm trying to make.
Or maybe that's not quite right.
It has more to do with setting things right for myself than making it up to you.
Does that make sense?
Shoot, I'm doing such a terrible job explaining this! :(
The bottom line is, I WANT to believe the things you say now.
That's all you need to know!
*Shudders uncontrollably at "word" usage.*
Sure!
I don't know.
The baking chest, maybe?
D'aw.
That's sweet of you, I guess?
What are the restrictions?
Well, what immediately catches my attention is this enormous book.
I wonder how it squares with your size restriction?
My Unabridged Sassacre's!
It's a very rare edition, and a precious family heirloom, so I don't know if it would make an ideal candidate for the journey.
But what if it gets damaged!
Oh! Silly me, what was I even worried about!
That wasn't even a Freudian slip.
Doctor Freud just tripped over an errant phallus, tumbled down a flight of stairs, and broke his neck.
And then his cigar exploded comically in his face.
It was spectacular.
Couldn't we send Wise Guy instead?
At least it can be easily replaced.
?
HM??
No, I reject your proposal that we "fuck" Wise Guy, whatever that actually means, or for that matter, the spelling of any adorable rodents named after African nations.
I don't... think so?
About what?
I am not being a tightass!
Oh god dammit.
Take the book! What do I care!!!
I fail to see what offering up a priceless book for your wildly capricious science experiment has to do with my resolution to be less stingy with my beliefs, but alright.
Yes, let's just get on with it.
It worked!
The book is gone!
What is it?
Did you receive the book?
Don't tell me.
The book is damaged somehow, isn't it?
Sigh. Is it at least SOMEWHAT intact?
Or was it completely incinerated in transit?
I just KNEW we should have used Wise Guy. I can't believe this.
Oh.
Then what's the problem?
Will you tell me what happened??
About what?
Yet another exploding game trap?
Yes.
But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.
Why?
She was probably just trying to protect me from the Batterwitch's latest assassination attempt.
Sheesh, I can't believe you all finally got me saying "Batterwitch" too. Who would have thought?
What? Really?
...
Why would she do that?
But...
If she felt so strongly that I shouldn't play, she could have told me.
Or, told me more forcefully, I guess. I would have listened!
Maybe.
:(
Maybe she was justified in taking such an extreme measure. I sure hadn't been taking her seriously.
She even warned me not to play it until she got back, but I went ahead anyway because I was too impatient!
Actually...
Now that I think about it, she was probably going to disarm it or such when she got back, seeing as her objective had essentially been accomplished already by an ACTUAL assassination attempt.
After that, I told her I would believe her about everything.
That probably made her feel guilty about setting me up, so she told me not to touch the file until she returned.
But then I went ahead and ran it anyway like a doofus.
I think she just wanted to be believed.
Shucks.
Am I an awful friend?
I'm not so sure about that.
Heh!
You're right.
I guess that's a pretty apt metaphor, even though it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.
I just wanted to start playing the game so badly!
Now more than ever. I have reason to believe the stakes have increased dramatically.
I think our dream counterparts are all marked for death, and if we are to stand a chance, we must move quickly.
Oh, she told you already?
Um.
Are you being ironic again?
Dersite? You mean the other planet? The evil one?
What did the story say about me?
I didn't realize you had woken up in the game already.
When did that happen?
I guess I shouldn't act surprised you didn't tell me. What with all your highfalutin secrecy.
Pretending? Why?
I'm still not sure I'm following.
Why are you maintaining the appearance of being asleep? On Prospit, it seemed as if the people there regarded me and Jake very highly. Like celebrated figures.
Is it not the same way on Derse?
In other words, read newspapers, get a feel for "the word on the street," and such?
As might a detective? :B
You mean... secret agents??
Who's that?
I guess I should find all that ominous.
But I cannot lie, sir.
Nothing you have said has made me one iota less excited to begin this adventure!
Those dastardly agents can try to assassinate me all they like. I just want to get started!
Right.
Still fixing to pull the strings for us, per your extensive puppet metaphor?
Hrm.
Alrighty, I think I can make that concession.
Sounds like a plan.
I do hope she comes around. It would be a bummer to play without her.
Say, do I even have any machines that survived the explosion besides this one?
I guess not. :p
Still, some nice things were surely destroyed.
I think Detective Pony was caught in the blast.
It's unlikely Acorn survived. :'(
So, since I'm apparently out of "neutral devices,"
Which computer is Seb installing the file on?
Gotcha.
My poor dad.
He surely heard the explosion. I've put him through so much today.
Oh no...
I just had a dreadful thought.
The kitchen is just below my room.
What if he had begun baking his afternoon cake when my computer exploded?
Maybe I should go look?
Though I'm a little afraid to.
I hope so.
The Crockers have something of a legacy when it comes to losing forebears in mysterious explosions.
I would be so sad if I kept the tradition alive like this.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Heyyy.
Ahem.
Ro-Lal?
Oh?
With whom?
Sigh.
Oh god dammit.
Take the book! What do I care!!!
I fail to see what offering up a priceless book for your wildly capricious science experiment has to do with my resolution to be less stingy with my beliefs, but alright.
Yes, let's just get on with it.
It worked!
The book is gone!
What is it?
Did you receive the book?
Don't tell me.
The book is damaged somehow, isn't it?
About what?
Yet another exploding game trap?
Yes.
But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Wait...
What?
Oh gosh. Another large contraption!
Okay.
Say, what's with the red text, Dirk?
Are you typing your most important instructions in red now?
...
Alrighty, I am in my father's study!
I have kindly asked Mr. Sebastian to hand over the reins to this silly computer shaped like a man.
What now?
What?
Who's right?
:B
Yes!
Oh, wait.
It's Roxy again.
Can you hold on? I'll try to make it quick.
:?
I'm not sure that qualifies as innuendo at all.
I honestly think you misspell things intentionally more often than not, regardless of blood alcohol content.
You just typed wonk five times in a row!
What is this urgent thing about, anyway?
Is it about your boobytrap?
Because you're too late. It already blew up my whole bedroom, thank you very much.
Yes, me too. Right now in fact, and I'm in a bit of a hurry!
What is this about? What are you even doing?
Before what's too late?
Oh my god.
This isn't happening now...
No! Cease your lascivious porcolating at once!
Roxy, I can see you're set on just wasting more of my time.
I understand if you don't wish to play this game, but please try not to interfere with those of us who do!
My chance?
What are you talking about?
A move? You mean, a romantic one?
On you?
Um.
On me?
Oh.
Ohhh.
I didn't think...
That...
Hrm.
Are you sure?
Well then.
This is quite a development.
Poor Dirk!
Well, surely when he reveals his feelings, Jake will...
I mean...
He couldn't possibly...
Yes?
Because Jake is not a homosexual!
Are you saying he is?
Then what are you saying?
But...
I thought it reasonable to presume he takes a shining to ladies.
He does speak fondly of certain females from his favorite films, does he not?
Well, now I just don't know. You have me completely bamboozled about this.
What do you think?
Okay. Then what does your acute seabeast scanner make of Jake, then?
Oh brother.
Then, your guess is as good as mine?
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to conclude from this.
Yes.
But you just said you don't know!!!
Oh, not this tightass baloney again.
What?
...
No way!
We settled this, remember?
My prior resolution made it definitive; I was to be regarded as exceedingly permissive in certain respects!
So ridiculous. >:P
I promised to BELIEVE what you say, not DO it!
If I agree to say something, will you stop tormenting me about it??
Fine.
But let the record show that this resolution has almost nothing whatsoever to do with your use of the phrase "SEX LAND."
Just...
I need to think of what to say, and wait for the right moment. Is that ok???
Well, 
He does often profess his love for adventure, I suppose.
Omg.
I really don't have a moment to spare, do I?
Jake!
Hey there. I was actually about to message you.
You did?
Wait...
What did she tell you?
Did she goad you into writing this message?
What ways?
Provocative my behind!
She is skirting dangerously close to meddlesome territory.
??
Has one of his gadgets been causing trouble for you over there as well?
Deterred from what?
Our stuff?
Um...
Yes.
Okay.
Have we?
Is there something you want to say to me, Jake?
About how you feel?
...
Go on.
No, it's ok...
Please continue!
Uh.
Wait...
What?
Wow, um.
Well,
I
No!
I guess...
That...
Sure was the thing I said! Ha ha.
No!!!!!!
Oh my God, what am I saying here?
Jake, I didn't mean it! I didn't want to make you feel that way!
...
No? :(
It is?
You have?
You would??
Friends!
Oh boy!!
Everything else?
I don't think I'm following.
And mixed metaphors, apparently?
I really don't, Jake.
What?!
What's happening?
Jake, could you just tell me what you're talking about?
Haha, yes!
Friends!!!!
Well what are friends for Jake!!!!!
Me?
HOO HOO HOO!
I'm just
Terrific!
I'm feeling so...
Friendly!!!
I clearly just want to be a good friend and bring all my AMAZING FRIENDLINESS to bear on your problems.
Friendlystyle! Ahahahah?
Shit I mean
Ahahahah!
What?
Courtship??
Huh!
Really?
Yeaaah.
What's inevitable?
Uhhhhh...
I don't think you have to do anything you don't want to, Jake.
Wait.
DO you not want to?
Well...
No.
I don't think that makes you weird, Jake.
I think
That
I think that it's great if you are open to exploring those feelings.
Yes.
As a matter of fact you have.
Heh.
Whee!
Whoops!!
Hmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is what I am good for, it seems!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Yeaaaaaaaah..........
Say, Jake?
Not to cast doubt on your feelings, but are you quite sure all of Dirk's actions have been for the sake of courtship?
You did say his robot was prone to assailing you, did you not?
Is that really an affectionate gesture?
Oh.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
Yeah.
I can see how such a complicated relationship could keep you preoccupied.
I guess I can't blame you.
Maybe you should just...
I don't know.
Maybe you should just go for it.
Hell, why not.
Just tell him you know how he feels and that you're open to the idea?
...
Yeah sure why the hell not.
Well,
He likes you.
You seem to like him well enough.
Just...
Yes.
Why not??
Sounds good to me!!!
And why would that be?!
What, are you expecting me to advocate a more conservative approach?
To tell you to keep being shy and cagey and keep beating around the bush indefinitely??
What would ever give you that idea about me!
I BELIEVE YOU WILL FIND THAT AS REFRESHING BOLDNESS GOES I AM SIMPLY THE BEST THERE IS.
Screw it!
Ask him out.
Just kill the suspense already.
Become boyfriends and such.
Have some babies!!!
Okay I think I have to go.
I have this stupid game to play.
Get this shit out of my face.
Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it, and if I did, I sure wouldn't want to talk about it with you!
I just want to go to sleep and not wake up forever.
Oh, hello.
Did what, exactly?
Sure.
Yes. Sorry. I'm still feeling a little overwhelmed by what just happened.
A giant pit seems to have swollen my house whole! My dad is missing too. I think I should try to find him as soon as possible.
Ha ha, you call this grumpy?
Not exactly!
That's good.
But wait...
I thought you said you've never met him?
Then how did he make a mess in there?
Did he break into your room while you were asleep?
Huh?
Uh...
Oh.
It's rather desolate. Pretty eerie, actually.
I haven't run into anyone at all. I think I might be alone here?
The balloons are nice, I suppose.
Yes. But what about your brother?
Hey!
Roxy!
You won't believe where I am right now.
Ok, maybe you will.
But I'm in the game finally! It's considerably more outlandish than I was expecting.
No, I was thinking...
Well, I don't know. Something more like...
THAT'S why you're contacting me???
Roxy, please, I don't think you understand.
There are MYSTERIES here.
REAL MYSTERIES AND PUZZLES TO SOLVE.
Groan.
Hardly.
If you really want to know, I completely blew it with him forever. Satisfied?
He asked me if I liked him, and in the heat of the moment I panicked and said no.
And then he went on this whole thing about Dirk, and...
That's that.
Can we drop it now?
It's not a "love report!" Will you stop it?
What? There's a fire?
Oh, gosh.
Please be careful!
:(
Jake! Wait!
Oh no.
Thank you!
That last skull was a doozy, to be honest.
Har har.
Hey, I thought you couldn't see me once I left the house?
Oh yeah?
Blehhhh, why??
That figure would be sitting pretty at one hundred percent.
Ok, let's stop talking about stupid things for a minute. What a completely absurd environment for our typical blithering discourse.
I am hot on the prowl for more clues about this strange and mysterious land!
What?
Anyway, I think I'm getting closer to finding where my house went.
Then I can reunite with dad, and together we can sleuth this great big pickle of a planet!
Yes, I knew it!
Oh no!
Golly, why did he have to leave??
This really complicates matters. I hope he doesn't get lost.
Yes. Good idea.
Got it! Thanks!
What?
Um.
Oh!
No!!
I am not going to destroy my dad's car.
There has to be a better way to gather up grist, though.
No, and I can't say I'm too disappointed.
Of course I have!
Levels?
I think I've done a fair job of scaling my echeladder without resorting to the slaughter of innocent, fictional monsters, thank you very much.
I'm getting a little tired of various iterations of Dirk Strider telling me how I need to be more like Jake.
I know you think Jake is neat. I know all the Dirks just ADORE Jake! I GET IT!
You don't need to remind me about that. I'm suddenly having flashbacks to a few years ago when he would ambush me almost every day for a pointless round of strife.
Boy does getting swatted with brooms and having cakes shoved in your face get old fast.
Well. Yes.
I am not going to spar with Lil Sebastian!!!
He is too quick and deadly to fight with.
And also, too adorable. :B
You could be right.
I will give it a try.
Welp, let me have it!
A hard time for botching up the pooch!
I think I just locked the door with that muttonheaded stunt. And now that mirrored obelisk is good as gone.
Oh brother.
That is really, really robo-smart.
Ok?
Alright, I think I can do that.
What should I do in the meantime?
Oh stop it!
None of our friends will answer me. What could they be up to?
You must at least know what Dirk is doing.
Some what?
She's fighting robots too, you mean?
Why?
What? What issue!
Are you sure she's not just trying to kill them?
It wouldn't be her first assassination attempt.
But it nearly worked!
I would be dead right now if not for the whims of GCat.
So, you're saying she's only pretending to hunt us?
Then you're saying Dirk and Roxy aren't really in danger from the robots?
Augh! I just want to talk to my friends and see if they're ok.
What about Jake?
Then I guess I'll just sit here and worry about everyone quietly until Seb gets back.
What?
Oh yeah!
I forgot about her.
But I suppose that's because she's always the one to contact me. I never get a response when I message her.
You can do that??
Hello?
Are you there?
Oh my! You answered!
You never answer.
Well, no. I don't mean to be accusatory.
I am just surprised.
Well... nothing in particular. Just thought it would be nice to catch up.
I was beginning to think I was the only one of my friends left alive.
Maybe this gloomy place full of salamander bones and dusty old relics is starting to get to me.
Not to mention the most unwelcome presence of entrepreneurial clowns and their enormous codpieces.
I'm still trying to track down my father. I've been gathering clues, and I may be getting close.
Do you by any chance know if I might see him soon?
Hmm...
Are you there?
Phew! That's nice to know. Thanks.
You aren't usually forthcoming with future tidbits. Er, not that I was always especially eager to believe you about them anyway.
But I think I've been coming around on that lately, for what it's worth.
So, um.
Hey.
Are you ok there?
You seem rather preoccupied.
What's wrong?
Is it your brother?
That sounds awful!
I had no idea things had gotten this grim for you. I am so sorry.
Are you sure it's hopeless with him? You can't reach a truce, just for the sake of playing?
I think you have alluded to this before, but I never really understood.
What game?
Try me!
Of course not. I wrote off your reticence as one of your many eccentricities long ago.
I still want to understand this game with your brother, though.
Could you describe some of the other rules?
Hemotyping?
But your race has varied blood color?
Then what would yours be?
Jeez. Why?
Are you saying you have such powers?
But he does not?
Maybe he is jealous of you, which is why there is such resentment?
The way you described it, I had always envisioned your contentious relationship as one played out mostly online.
And also that you and he had never met. Yet some things you have said lately appear to contradict this?
I understand.
That makes sense, but I'm not sure I see how it applies.
:B
<3
You were??
What is it? Or is it a surprise?
Your juju?
Where did you get it?
Um... gosh.
It sure sounds like you two are up to your necks in this crazy game.
Not such a big fan of games?
Um.
Beauty?
Really?
What is it?
Shucks!!!!!
Ok, what do I do?
Upgrades? What upgrades?
Wait, is that how this stupid "Delirious Biznasty" application got on here?
Why?
Sheesh.
Very well then, Mister Zipperlips.
Whatever! Let's curtail the horseplay this once while I help Roxy.
Ok. I installed it. Now what? Should I run it?
Okey dokey. Doing that now.
Hey, I can see her room! :B
That's a really nice room there.
But where is she?
Hah, her drink is still there. So she can't have gone far.
I don't see her anywhere in the rest of the house.
I see plenty of plush wizards and window gizmos, and... pumpkins? Really, Roxy?
What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?
I just tried messaging her. But no response.
She said things were on fire when we last talked?
Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.
But judging by the view from her window, it looks lovely outside.
What exactly is the danger I am saving her from here?
OH NO!!!!!
Roxy, where are you??? :(
How do you know she's not hurt?
Then what is?
Oh...
Yes.
What IS that??
Right. Let's see.
There's hardly any space in here to put anything. I'll have to make some room.
I don't want to damage any of her belongings though.
WHOOPS!
Dag nabbit. This trackpad is AWFUL!
Lousy dad computer.
Why does he have to buy his computers at the Dadly Depot?
Why does he have to buy EVERYTHING at the Dadly Depot?
I really need to keep looking for him soon. Thinking about our expeditions to the Dadly Depot is making me miss him.
There. Those seem like suitable locations for the equipment.
Hey, where's Lil Seb?
I think he went through the door.
He just disappeared on that platform!
I think it might be some kind of transport device, that works via teleportation.
A kind of "transportalizer," to coin a completely silly and novel term.
But I think that's where my dad went too!
I have to follow him.
It'll be fine!
I'm bringing my computer with me. I can tend to Roxy's entry along the way.
Hey! Where are you??
I can't find you anywhere in your crazy house.
It's just wizards and pumpkins as far as the eye can see.
I hope you're ok!
Please get back to me as soon as you can.
Oh. Hello, Jake.
Um, not really? Roxy and I are just setting a few things up here.
No, it's fine! It's really nice to hear from you, actually.
I was starting to worry you might have forgotten.
Oh no...
Never mind.
No, Jake.
We didn't need your help raiding a tomb. But thanks for thinking of us.
I don't know what this clueless pair of damsels would do without you.
Yes. It has to do with the day I was born, which was almost exactly sixteen years ago.
Didn't you get Roxy's invitation?
It was my understanding that she gave you and Dirk notice weeks ago.
Mm.
Jake. I... what?
Well, if you recall, the party is actually tomorrow.
Like I said, we're just setting a few things up.
Roxy is putting up some decorations. I baked a cake. You were of course free to join us early too. I just thought since I hadn't heard from you in quite some time, you had better things to do.
Yes. So?
Jake, what was it you actually wanted?
Mmm.
...
It's been more like five months.
Mmhmm.
Yes.
Many times.
Mmhmm.
Mm.
That's nice, Jake. I'm kind of busy though.
What did you actually want to talk to me about?
Actually, why don't we just talk about it tomor-
You don't say.
Mm.
Mmmm!
Mmhmm.
Hmm!
Jake.
Jake.
Jake!!!
Shut up!
Shut up!!!
JAKE.
PLEASE.
STOP TALKING.
JAKE.
I SAID SHUT UP.
JUST,
SHUT,
THE FUCK,
UUUUUUUUUUP!!!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S THE MATTER???
I AM SICK.
AND FUCKING TIRED.
TO DEATH.
OF YOUR INSUFFERABLE BLITHERING BULLSHIT!!!!!!
I AM SHOUTING!
THERE ARE LITERAL SHOUTS OF ANGER COMING OUT OF MY ACTUAL MOUTH, AND THEY ARE DIRECTED AT YOU!
OH MY GOD. WHY ARE YOU SO CLUELESS?
I CAN'T STAND IT!
IT'S NOT ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY!!!
THE FACT THAT YOU FORGOT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP, BUT THAT'S NOT IT. SEE, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!
OH, AND COULD YOU PLEASE STOP SAYING SHUCKS BUSTER?!
SHUCKS BUSTER WAS MY THING! AND YOU STOLE IT!
NO, IT WAS MY THING, BUT I ALLOWED IT TO BE OUR THING! BACK WHEN YOU USED TO GIVE A SHIT! BUT NOW IT'S JUST MINE, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE!
.................
JAKE, LET ME ASK YOU.
DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE TALKED?
NO. TRY A FEW WEEKS AGO!
AND EVEN THEN, YOU MESSAGED ME JUST TO TALK ABOUT SOME STUPID SHIT THAT HAPPENED WITH DIRK.
A TEDIOUS GESTURE WHICH YOU THEN SAW FIT TO REPRISE ON MY BIRTHDAY OF ALL DAYS, WHILST CONSIDERATELY FORGETTING ABOUT IT!
AND EVEN WHEN I REMINDED YOU ABOUT IT, YOU STILL BARGED AHEAD WITH YOUR SELF-INDULGENT RELATIONSHIP CLAPTRAP ANYWAY!
YEAH! THAT'S BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME WE CHAT, YOU DO NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT YOURSELF!
YOU NEVER ASK ME HOW I'M FEELING OR WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO. YOU JUST LAUNCH INTO YOUR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS, AND I JUST LISTEN LIKE AN ACCOMMODATING FOOL AS ALWAYS!
SO I JUST STOPPED BOTHERING! WHY SHOULD I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THAT REPEATEDLY?!
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE MOST THOUGHTLESS, SELF-CENTERED PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!
I CAN'T BELIEVE I USED TO FEEL...
JAKE, HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU HOW IT MUST FEEL FOR SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HER FRIEND GO ON AND ON ABOUT HIS BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS WHEN...
WHEN ALL ALONG SHE...
BUT SHE JUST COULDN'T SAY BECAUSE SHE BLEW IT AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO...
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M BOTHERING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. NEVER MIND.
YEAH. I...
I know. :(
RAAARARRAAUUUAAAAUUAGHGHGGHGGGGHHGH!
NO!
YOU AREN'T COMING TO MY PARTY!
YOU AREN'T COMING TO MY PARTY, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A PARTY!
GO RAID SOME TOMBS WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND. GO MAKE OUT WITH HIM OR BREAK UP WITH HIM, OR WHATEVER IT IS YOUR FICKLE, SELFISH HEART DESIRES!
I AM AT THE END OF MY ROPE WITH YOU!
I AM FED UP WITH YOUR STUPID MOVIES AND YOUR STUPID ADVENTURES AND YOUR STUPID OLD TIMEY CHARMS AND YOU STUUUUUUPID DASHING GOOD LOOKS. WHO NEEDS ANY OF IT?????
OH, WILL YOU PLEASE,
JUST,
STFU BUSTER!!!!!!!!!
What the?
Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.
You are the absolute last person I want to hear from right now.
And the bottom of that list is pretty competitive territory at the moment!
I don't want us to become friends!
We all thought you were gone for good. And we liked it that way!
Please don't tell me you've found a second wind of petty trolling in you.
Whatever. And what's with the ugly green text?
Reading your malformed sentence fragments was unpleasant enough as it was.
"Whom" you can see, moron.
And no, you can't!
Calliope said you couldn't see us at all in our game session. So I think you're lying!
Oh, dear God.
WHY???
How wonderful for you.
I don't care how all-seeing and all-powerful you think you are.
If your intent is to waste my time with more of your pitiful bullying, you are out of luck.
Because that is exactly NOT the sort of crap I am in the mood for today.
Toodle-oo!!!
??
Hrm.
Nope. That makes very little sense.
Yes, I see it all too clearly now. You're really quite the charmer!
Uh huh.
So you're actually trying to claim that you find me attractive, from the alleged "bad means good" point of view of your hate-driven species?
Eww.
You pig.
Excuse me??
Oh, that's just great.
The ONE TIME we had a generic girly pillow fight, and it turns out some pervert was watching us.
I think I need a shower.
Assuming I can ever take one again in peace!
What?
...
Really?
What do you mean, exactly...
By "clout?"
Do you mean...
My...
Why am I even having this conversation!
What? No!
Are you insane?
I don't care where you are, or whatever the hell it is you "unlocked" to spy on me.
You aren't allowed to sit there all day leering at my boobs!!!
My... what?
Wait, what were YOU talking about?
Screw you!
Tell me what you were getting at with all that!!
The stuff about "clout," and my "bulbous locations."
Spacetime??
WHAT!
SHUT UP!
I'M NOT FAT!!!
GO FUCK YOURSELF!
Oh cripes.
What is it?
Oh goodness, no. You poor delusional thing.
I don't care what progress you think you've made. You will never be a good artist, dear.
Groan.
That is the most pointless and incomprehensible load of drivel I have ever read.
Your "portrait" is every bit as abysmal as I was expecting. And for the last time. I AM NOT FAT.
I think your claims of attraction to heavyset women, which you present as "flattery," is an obvious ruse to get me to feel insecure about my appearance, and it isn't going to work!
SHUT YOUR STUPID FACE!!!
UGH, THIS BIRTHDAY IS SO AWFUL! I CAN'T STAND IT!
WHY IS EVERYONE TREATING ME LIKE SHIT TODAY?
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?!
SHUT UP!
I'M DONE HUMORING YOUR PERVERTED ADOLESCENT MIND GAMES!
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO CALLIOPE!
CALLIOPE!!!
WE WANT YOU BACK! PLEASE COME BACK AND SPARE US FROM THIS LECHEROUS NINCOMPOOP!
CALLIOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK?!
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
NO!!! THAT CAN'T BE TRUE! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE EVEN YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE!
WHAT?? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY FATHER!
WHERE IS HE?
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN!!!
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ok...
So he's on Derse, then?
And I suppose you have??
No. Don't say that. Shut up!
YOU BASTARD! I SAID SHUT UP!!!
STOP IT
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!!!
FUCK YOU! HE'S NOT DEAD!
MY DAD'S FINE, I'M NOT FAT, AND I HATE YOU! I'M NEVER TALKING TO YOU AGAIN!!!!!!
AND STOP WATCHING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What.
What.
I think it fell into the crypt.
I think it fell into the crypt.
Ha.
In the interest of appeasing the irony gods, let's go with the latter.
Oh lord. The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid "sweet sixteen".
What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.
And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.
And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!
Haha. Thanks, Calliope.
Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.
I understand.
Boy, you really let him have it back there!
I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.
At least, it did at the time.
I only wish I could have stayed as lucid as you during our...
Transformation.
How did you manage that?
Okay.
So instead of keeping my cool like you, I just started gushing over him like a lovestruck loon, surrendering any sliver of dignity I might have earned by telling him off earlier.
I just cannot believe some of the things I said. Oh God. I told him I wanted to get married and have babies!!!
I know! But...
It's one thing to write off something you say to an altered state of mind. But what makes the admission so mortifying to me is...
I actually MEANT it.
And I'm sure he must know that by now.
And now I feel so humiliated I just want to die.
I would ask him to shoot me right here, if I could bring myself to say a word to him.
Woo!!!
We are all such WINNERS.
Ha.

Tell me about it.
Same.
But I always felt you had the advantage over me too!
Because you're... YOU.
You make things happen, and I don't.
It doesn't really. But that's fine. :B
Clearly we both used some poor judgment.
Looking back, it seems crazy to me that we both jeopardized our friendship over a mutual infatuation with, let's face it, one spectacularly goofy kid.
YES.
Yeah. That might have saved us a lot of grief.
It's not like I hate him now, even though that's probably what he thinks. He's still my friend.
But the extent to which I centered my whole life around a childish fantasy about him is just painfully embarrassing in hindsight.
I wonder if I'll ever be able to look at him again without feeling miserable about myself?
Me neither. :\
Perhaps.
Or maybe we just don't need anybody.
As anything other than friends, I mean.
Tell me about it.

Why would you think that?
Why would you think that?
Is everything ok?
I... see.
That's ok.
You were saying?
Yes.
Actually, once you did stop, it made me finally realize it was a problem for you for a long time.
And I didn't say anything at the time, but it made me wonder if I wasn't doing the right thing before.
By failing to point out you might have a problem? Or just going along with it and participating in lively banter any time you clearly had too much to drink?
Was I just being a bad friend?

But it turned out you couldn't bring her back. At least not the way you thought.
So what was it that made you finally decide to give it up?
Dear, sweet, precious Fefeta!

No, it stopped.

Yes.
No, not at all.

No, not at all.
I remember.
You said I would be the leader of our team, in name and in spirit.
Although I never really felt like it.
