4022
Taaaaaaaavros.
4022
Red team is going to 8ite the dust!
4022
And I know you are on the red team.
4022
Yeah, you totally are.
4022
My team's got no use for a 8oy that can't make no use of his legs!
4022
You were f8ed for a team of losers, full of 8lind girls and lame 8oys and cranky iiiiiiiim8eciles.
4022
::::)
4022
Oh????????
4022
Whaaaaaaaat. Promised who?
4022
Omg, who's that????????
4022
I h8 this guy already!
4022
Haha! So he's imaginary! A fake.
4022
Like a made up friend, the way fairies are.
4022
Made up make believe fakey fake fakes.
4022
Who told you to do something so fraudulent?
4022
Oh maaaaaaaan, what a meddler.
4022
I h8 her meddling! Why is she always meddling?
4022
I don't know if it was a joke, 8ut man.
4022
I don't think it was a joke. It was more like........
4022
Ok, complete this analogy.
4022
Laughing is to a joke as meddling is to ........?
4022
Exactly! That's what she just did to you.
4022
It is worse than a joke. It is worse than anything you can do.
4022
Next time tell her to can it! That's what I do.
4022
But she keeps 8ugging me. 8ugging and fussing and meddling. What's her deal!
4022
I guess it's flattering that she wants to talk to me so much though. I guess I don't mind. It's cool.
4022
Anyway Tavros, you've been amazingly 8oring as usual, so I'm going to go.
4022
This show needs to get on the freaking road.
4022
8elieve it or not, the 8lue team doesn't have a single player in the session yet!
4022
While you guys have like two or three or such!
4022
Un8elievable, I wonder what the holdup is. Oh well, let's face it! You guys need the head start.
4022
Ok, anyway, good luck to you. It will be just like old tiiiiiiiimes.
4022

4022
Adios, Toreasnore!!!!!!!!
4044
Araaaaaaaadiiiiiiiia!
4044
I know!
4044
So we're a8out to get started right?
4044
Have you tricked Sollux yet?
4044
Do you have Mr. Two Eyes all 8efuddled and flustered in your we8 of lies?
4044
Or Mr. Four Eyes?
4044
Hmmmmmmmmm.
4044
I don't know. Which nickname do you think would 8e suita8ly derogatory in this case Aradia?
4044
::::P
4044
Ok, whatever. The point is.
4044
Once you have pulled the finely woven silken mesh over his dum8 different colored eyes, you and I will start playing the game and 8e the 8lue team leaders.
4044
That's how this will work right????????
4044
Wait do you mind if we are co-leaders? I forgot to ask! I just assumed it was ok with you.
4044
Great. That's the spirit!
4044
And when I 8ring you into the game, whatever the hell that means, then we can send each other stuff right? That is how this works right?
4044
Awesome!
4044
8ecause I have a present for you. It's a surprise, and it's going to 8e great. From me to you.
4044
Just from me. From me alone and no8ody else.
4044
I can't wait to see the look on your face when you see.
4044
Hey speaking of which, what will the name of our team 8e?
4044
No no no no no. I know that.
4044
I mean the name of OUR team. You and me. Just uuuuuuuus.
4044
::::)
4044
I just thought it would 8e really fitting.
4044
Kind of like a fresh start, you know?
4044
I don't know, what are our shared interests? I guess I never really thought a8out this! I guess I'm used to thinking of you as the enemy. There must 8e some overlap in profiles.
4044
Come oooooooon, let's 8rainstorm!
4044
Man, it'll 8e great. We'll 8e unstoppa8le. Surely you must admit it will 8e nice to re8ound from the Team Charge de8acle!
4044
Oh maaaaaaaan, I'm so dum8! Here I am running my mouth and opening up old wounds, while at the very same time trying to make amends! What an idiot.
4044
Hey speaking of which, that loser isn't going to 8e on the 8lue team is he?
4044
Your old team 8uddy!
4044
Oh thank fucking goodness! Talk a8out dead weight. You made the right choice, leader! I mean co-leader.
4044
Man, now I've got this huge 8eefgrub lodged in my nook just thinking a8out him.
4044
I'm going to go give him a hard time.
4044
Let me know when you're live! Later.
4072
Wellllllll?
4072
Hey 8oy-Skytard, are you going to just stand there all night?
4072
Make your move, make your move, make your move!
4072
Weak! Weaky weaky weak.
4072
Yes. Your 8l8tant excuse making is the weakiest lame that ever shit the coward 8ed.
4072
Roll your dice. Make your move.
4072
Advance or a8scond!
4072
8ut a8sconding is what you do 8est!
4072
I 8n't managed to cloud a scenario yet you couldn't squawk out of in a 8lazing trail of cluck8east feathers.
4072
You cannot hope to 8eat Tavros Nitram in an a8scond-off.
4072
He is simply the 8est there is!
4072
Hey pipe down!
4072
Make your move!
4072
Advance or a8scond, advance or a8scond!
4072
Roll, Tavros! Roll!!!!!!!!
4073
No one can help you, Taaaaaaaavros!
4073
::::)
4073
Time to decide!
4073
What does that have to do with your present cowardice?
4073
Are you going to roll?
4073
Why not?
4073
So, you give up?
4073
Why not roll and make it official?
4073
Why would you want to cheapsk8 me out of 8onuses like that? It's so thoughtless.
4073
Am I going to have to take matters into my own hands?
4073
To make your move for you?
4073
8ut if you are going to 8reak the rules and refuse to roll, what choice do I have!
4073
I h8 that it had to come to this 8ut what can I do!
4074
Tavros, have I mentioned how cute you look in that plucky little outfit?
4074
Why if I didn't know 8etter, I'd say I was playing with Pupa Pan himself!
4074
Isn't that what you want, Tavros? To 8e like Pupa?
4074
Of course you do! What 8oy wouldn't want to 8e like Pupa! So dashing and 8rave.
4074
He is everything you are not!
4074
For one thing, he can flyyyyyyyy.
4074
Do you want to flyyyyyyyy, Tavros?
4074
Have you ever tried to fly? I 8et you haven't!
4074
How a8out we take to the skies, Pupa!
4074
Hahahaha, oh you like that idea, Pupa? Yes, you do. I can feel it in your simple, mallea8le 8rain.
4074
You want to fly so 8ad!
4075
Fly, Pupa!!!!!!!!
4075
Flyyyyyyyy!
4075
Hahahahahahahaha!
4076
Aaaaaaaahahahahahahahaha!
4076
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!
4076
Haaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaa!
4076
Adios, Toreadum8ass.
4076
:::;D
4078
Psssssssst.
4078
Hey 8rave leader.
4078
Can I join your team?
4078
Vile 8acksta88ing sociopath? Karkat, did you copy and p8ste that phrase directly from your personal ad descri8ing what you are looking for in a lady?
4078
That's not a 8ad guess! 8ut man! Karkat you sure are giving me a hard time.
4078
I don't see how we're supposed to 8e 8ecoming friends if you recoil from my olive 8ranch like I'm twitching a mummified 8ovine phallus in your direction.
4078
Not even h8 friends?
4078
Yessssssss. I'll take it!
4078
Anyway, I was just joking a8out wanting to 8e on your team.
4078
I'm already on the 8lue team.
4078
Yes, Aradia and I have an arrangement. We will 8e co-leaders.
4078
(But really I will 8e the leader! Heh heh. Shh! Don't tell anyone!)
4078
What do you think, Karkat? Can you take on two dangerous laaaaaaaadies at once?
4078
Come on! Aren't you a little nervous that I will oppose you? You should 8e!
4078
Pshhhhhhhh. Those days are far 8ehind me.
4078
Anyway, I can't control just any8ody. They've got to 8e impressssssssiona8le. Like you!
4078
Sure I can. I just choose not to.
4078
I find your mind totally unpalata8le to 8rowse. Looking into your 8rain is like pawing through a smelly dumpster.
4078
Full of 8roken glass and razor 8lades!
4078
And poop. D::::
4078
Oh, 8ack so soon! Did your thum8 slip on the 8utton????????
4078
I guess you can't get enough of me.
4078
::::)
4078
You 8n't got nothing on me and you can't prove shit!!!!!!!!
4078
Anyway, Karkat, I just wanted to say.
4078
<3
4102
Oh my god, why are you talking to me????????
4102
Still sticking with the white text I see. So smooth and stylish!
4102
I forgot how much I loved highlighting it to read all the 8oring things you have to say.
4102
It's like a fun game for super extra handicapped retarded people. Like opening a present! Find out what o8noxious thing the mystery tool typed.
4102
What is it!
4102
You didn't exploit me.
4102
You are just a petty douche with a 8ad temper who likes to pl8y g8mes, and all I did w8s humor you.
4102
So full of yourself!!!!!!!!
4102
Don't ch8nge the su8ject!!!!!!!!
4102
XXXXO
4102
I'm going to log off in a 8ig huff and you have to promise not to use that nasty trick where you log me 8ack on out of petty douchey spite!
4102
And then we can go 8ack to never ever talking, 8ecause man! That was heaven when it was like th8t!!!!!!!!
4102
Mm hmm. Slow down! Man.
4102
I am just wearing out so many pens taking all these important notes! Fuuuuuuuuck!
4102
Fuck you for ruining all my good note-taking pens and giving me this terri8le cramp in my good note-taking hand!!!!!!!!
4102
Blech. What a sno8. You're worse than my meddley meddler meddlefriend.
4102
I thought you said you would 8e 8rief????????
4102
Zzzzzzzz. 8ye, assh8le.
4104
Whaaaaaaaat.
4104
Huh? What kind of question is that!
4104
Is this a trick? Are you trying to sa8otage me? Are you in cahoots with someone????????
4104
Cahoooooooots!!!!!!!!
4104
Cahoots I say.
4104
What? Oh no.
4104
How did that happen?
4104
Really? Are you sure it wasn't sa8otage? I would suspect sa8otage if I was you.
4104
::::(
4104
She was so cool, you had the coolest lusus of anyone I know.
4104
I wanted to meet her some day.
4104
Yeah, meet her corpse! I guess that's not so bad a consol8tion prize.
4104
Seeing a 8ig dead cool mother gru8. Wow!
4104
You were so lucky. My lusus sucks! Haha.
4104
Why did you ask if she's dead, anyway? Do you know something????????
4104
Okaaaaaaaay, I don't really get that. So you can just go ahead think I'm some dum8 flighty 8road again.
4104
Now you have me a little worried. Man! I hope she's ok.
4104
Why would this happen? This is just my luck. Have some died 8esides yours????????
4104
And uh, you know who's, I guess. ::::o
4104
You mean a curse?
4104
Wow, between his curse and my shitty luck we are so screwed.
4104
Whew! There goes another one sailing over the idi8t girl's head! Ok, lay it on me.
4104
Uh. Ok.
4104
Why do you try to help me and stuff? What's the point!
4104
It's kind of bothersome. And insulting sometimes!
4104
So I have a messy room. 8ig deal. My luck fucking 8lows! It's got nothing to do with it and you just don't even know.
4104
Meddler. Why you so meddley, Miss Meddlesome McFussyfangs????????
4104
No way! I'm just fine. Why don't you can it.
4104
::::P
4104
Ok, so you're spying on me. Kind of creepy! Man, m8y8e you should get a l8fe.
4104
Or you know, if you're so h8gh 8nd might8 an8 th8nk you're so gr8at, m8y88 you c8uld oh I d8n't kn8w........
4104
TRY AND ST8P ME FROM DO8NG B8D THINGS????????
4104
U88888888h!
4104
Ok, gr8. Fine! I'm going to check on my lusus now.
4104
8ut I'm starting to think you are full of shit, and I am quite sure she will 8e QU8TE FIN8!
4104
Aaaaaaaah!
4104
Man, why d8dn't I just get th8 last w8rd and sign off real qu8ck like I usu8lly do????????
4104
Let you sne8k th8t stink8n' littl8 ninja quip in th8r8. Ah! So m8d.
4104
Lousy st8pid godd8mn supportive fri8nd!
4122
Equiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuus.
4122
Hey! I'm a8out to meddle with so many losers right now.
4122
So many! All the losers. All of them.
4122
Oh man, was that sarcasm? That sounded like sarcasm!
4122
Pshhhhhhhh, I know! I know you never make jokes. I was the one 8eing sarcastic, you stooge!
4122
I was 8eing sarcastic a8out you 8eing sarcastic. Duh.
4122
The fuck I am! Anyway. Hey!
4122
Did you finish Aradia's present yet? I'm a8out to fuss with her and I want to know if I can keep my promise or if you're gonna make a liar out of me.
4122
Great! Thanks, 8uddy. I'll 8e w8ting here for you.
4122
8ecause I promised I would and it's none of your damn 8usiness! Man.
4122
Quit your prying! Always fidgeting and poking and prying.
4122
Agreeeeeeeed.
4122
So just to review!
4122
We will let Aradia perpetr8 her cute little ploy on Sollux and usurp his power.
4122
Isn't it funny when these chumps try to get all tactical and underhanded? It's really adora8le!
4122
Anyway. She makes her little powergra8, and that's when we 8oth step in and usurp her as co-leaders.
4122
Right????????
4122
Ok, good. Then the 8est team will 8e led 8y the two highest 8loods, the way it should 8e!
4122
Or at least, the highest 8loods who aren't shitty clown worshippers or under water freaks. Sound good?
4122
Yes.
4122
Yes.
4122
Yeeeeeeees!!!!!!!!
4122
Gr8! What a gr8 team we are.
4122
Heeeeeeeey........
4122
You wouldn't 8e planning anything sneaky, would you????????
4122
What! How could you suggest such a thing! Man, so insulting.
4122
Perfect. We have the perfect plan, and no one is plotting any sort of dou8lecrossings or 8acksta88ery or anything like that.
4122
I know! Don't worry, dude. I trust you completely.
4122
8ullshit!
4122
Pro8a8ly just another one of your many daily rage aneurysms.
4122
Why don't you cool your jets and have a glass of gross muscle8east milk????????
4122
Oh g8d!
4122
D8n't you d8re!!!!!!!!
4137
It looks like tonight we will have to 8reak our truce. Or at least suspend it. Hope you don't mind!
4137
Because tonight we will play a game together. For the first time in I don't even know. Forever!
4137
Man, you like to give me such a hard time a8out all that. I can't catch a 8reak!
4137
Can't you see I'm trying to put all that 8ehind me and make amends with every8ody?
4137
No, of course you can't see that. What am I saying!
4137
::::(
4137
I'll prove it to you. I'm giving Aradia a present that will make her feel all 8etter finally.
4137
Then I'll 8e in the clear. Phew! Totally redeemed. You'll see. I mean smell.
4137
Man, why can't you cut me some slack for once????????
4137
It's not like I even did anything that 8ad to you.
4137
I lost seven eyes 8ut you only lost two! I would say you came out ahead in the 8argain.
4137
Ugh! Your sarcasm really stings when here I am just trying to 8e nice. Ok, I guess I deserve it.
4137
Aaaaaaaah!
4137
Fine, 8e that way. But you shouldn't sit there and pretend we're so different.
4137
Remem8er Team Scourge? How convenient all that must 8e to have forgotten! You were so nasty.
4137
Oh man, if you crossed Terezi Pyrope you were fucked!!!!!!!!
4137
Yeah, those were the days.
4137
I mean, days full of mist8kes and r8gret!
4137
But it was still a lot of fun. Watching you dismantle huge teams of Flarpers with nothing 8ut politics and head games.
4137
Without even using any special powers! Wow.
4137
Come oooooooon!
4137
What do I have to do here?
4137
Well if you want to know what I think, you should start changing your tune.
4137
Cause even though you got all these highfalutin morals and fancy reserv8tions, you know as well as me that a killer is a killer is a killer!
4137
There 8n't no ch8nging your ways for good, and one d8y you're going to flail that silly l8ttle cane of yours and not find n8thin to 8ump into, and fall f8ce first into the shit ag8in.
4137
And you're going to do something t8rri8le to some8ody and wish you could t8ke it 8ack 8ut you c8n't!!!!!!!!
4137
And then you'll work hard to win 8ack their trust, and you'll try and try and tr8, and you'll see how hard it is!
4137
You'll seeeeeeee!
4137
You'll see.
4137
I am whispering that and it is echoing and ominous.
4137
You'll seeeeeeee........
4137
You'll seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
4137
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee........
4137
Hahahahahahahaha.
4137
Whoa, what was that????????
4137
There was a loud noise outside my hive!
4137
It sounded like an explosion.
4137
And then another one!
4137
And now something that sounds like an avalanche!!!!!!!!
4137
That dum8ass is probably punching ro8ots again.
4137
I will go outside and look.
4137
You got it! ::::::::)
4144
Well what! I am surrounded 8y ghosts and kind of fre8king out a8out it!
4144
I don't know, I guess I will just curl into a little 8all and cry and hope they go aw8y!
4144
Is that what you want to hear you sick f8ck????????
4144
Who????????
4144
Will that make them go away?
4144
I don't have to do shit!
4144
May8e I don't mind ghosts. May8e they'll 8e gr8 company once I get used to them!
4144
Ok, so why don't YOU kill her! 8e my guest! Wow, thanks for offering. Wh8t a pal!
4144
Oh really, well you seemed pretty excited a8out killing Tavros too.
4144
And you even helped! So I guess that is how you work after all.
4144
I know I did! I still do, I guess. I dunno.
4144
8ut I was never gonna kill these people. They were like, off limits I guess?
4144
These games were just supposed to 8e fun and serve no other purpose!
4144
Yeah ok, you getting off on talking a girl into killing her 8uddies sure is important!
4144
Los8r.
4144
I'm 8eginning to think you really 8elieve that! So delusion8l. You're just a path8tic, lonely gamer who 8uys into his own character profile 8S.
4144
Hahahahahahahaha!
4144
You're the dum8est omniscient person I ever met.
4144
Sure you know a lot, 8ut I know for a FACT there's stuff you don't know.
4144
8ecause you need to add more 8l8tant lies to patch up all the holes in your sad cover story.
4144
::::P
4144
Yeah, 8ut I'm getting closer to 8eating you. You'll see.
4146
Araaaaaaaadiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaa.
4146
Nice trick! With the ghosts and all. Man, you got me pretty good.
4146
Fair enough!
4146
Just wanted to say I'm sorry, that's all.
4146
Yeah I know. I'll make it up to him some day. Don't worry!
4146
Anyway, hey guess what?
4146
I've got a message for you from your 8oyfriend.
4146
He's outside your hive right now!
4146
Take a look.
4146
Well ok, I'm just the messenger. If you want to risk missing him then suit yourself.
4146
L8er!!!!!!!!
4151
Arrivederci, Megido.
4158
Ummmmmmmmm, no?
4158
A8out what?
4158
Oh, that? I thought we were done talking a8out it!
4158
We concluded I messed up and I'm completely horri8le in every way.
4158
I can only feel SO AWFUL, you know. Here, I'm 8anging my head against the desk now.
4158
8ang 8ang 8ang. Are you happy?
4158
Uuuuuuuugh, what do you want from me????????
4158
You should lighten up a 8it. May8e even congratul8 me!
4158
Wow, great jo8 Vriska! Single handedly taking out Team Charge like that.
4158
No more competition from those low class clowns!
4158
Ok, well, change your mind a8out what!
4158
What are you going to do, Pyrope!
4158
Hahahahahahahaha!
4158
You mean from your tree? With all your AMAAAAAAAAZING POWERS?
4158
Tell me, what sort of powers do tree girls have? Swinging from vines and stuff?
4158
Yeah right!!!!!!!!
4158
Complete and total muscle8east shit!
4158
I don't need to do that to know you're 8luffing.
4176
What's your deal????????
4176
Did you just zap Equius into the game? His hive disappeared!
4176
Hell no! I was supposed to get your surprise present from him! Um, that he was keeping for me! 8ut only temporarily!
4176
And then we were going to jump in the g8me tog8ther! As co-le8ders! Remem8er????????
4176
8ut!
4176
Aaaaaaaah!
4176
You knew this was going to happen! You were planning it all along! You're planning all this. I know a schemer when I see one!
4176
No! It had to go the way we said it would. I was going to give you the present I convinced him to m8ke for you. Me! It wo8ldn't have got m8de if not f8r me!
4176
And then you could have a 8ody again and everyth8ng would 8e fine. Then we could go 8ack to 8eing friends again.
4176
Yeah!!!!!!!!
4176
I don't know. I felt like we were even if you didn't think so.
4176
I guess I'm not very good at acting like a friend. Or saying stuff like, hey friend! You're my friend! It doesn't really occur to me.
4176
8ut we were! Why would you play with me if you didn't think I was your friend?
4176
8arf. More of this apathetic 8aloney. Why don't you cut the ghost girl act already? I get it! You're dead and spooky.
4176
Hm.
4176
Uh, okay?
4176
Haha. Pretty odd!
4176
That's cool, you can ri88it if you want. In a weird way it almost makes you sound normal!
4176
So what now? I guess you and Equius co-lead since he managed to usurp me. That cunning 8astard.
4176
I guess I follow you into the game instead? Fine 8y me! I'll follow you guys. Just give me my orders, 8oss.
4176
Oh what the fuuuuuuuuck!
4176
I get it. I finally see now. This is your revenge.
4176
You finally did it, Megido. You got me pretty good. Well played.
4176
What a load of SHIIIIIIIIT. You've 8een plotting your revenge since day one. And I fell for it like a sucker. Can't say I 8lame you.
4176
8ut why not!
4176
I killed you!!!!!!!!
4176
AAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!
4176
You're so infuri8ing! Why c8n't you just h8 me? It would 8e a lot easier th8t way.
4176
Or at least feel 8othered or annoyed or S8METHING! God!!!!!!!!
4176
May8e I sh8uld just rip my he8rt out of my chest and pound it to a 8loody pulp here on my desk with my sup8r strong ro8ot arm.
4176
Pound pound pound pound pound pound pound pound!
4176
Look at that, more nasty 8lue 8lood all over me. Why not! Might as well op8n the floodg8s and p8nt my whole hive with this oh so envia8le cerulean SWILL.
4176
8ecause clearly it's up to me to feel em8tions for the 8oth of us, you misera8le soulless witch!
4176
I h88888888 you!
4176
H8 h8 h8 h8 h8 h8 h8 haaaaaaaate!
4176
I only regret killing you cause it m8de you so 8ORING!!!!!!!!
4176
I don't want to 8e on the red team. ::::(
4176
It's full of jerks who just think I'm a 8ig jerk.
4176
Oh god, I can't w8 for THAT convers8tion.
4176
What? Why would that 8e consol8tion? It's more vague spooky nonsense!
4176
Fuck you for me trying to help you.
4176
Fuck the 8lue team, fuck your conniving, fuck Equius's dou8ledealing and the stupid muscle8east he rode in on, and fuck you for s8ving my life.
4176
FUUUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!
4196
You're going to ask me to join your team, aren't you.
4196
I don't seem to have much choice now! Aradia kicked me off the good team.
4196
You dork.
4196
Do you really think your usual pedantic quips are going to 8ug me now????????
4196
I was just 8etrayed and a8andonded 8y my two accomplices and 8est pals, and on top of that I am soaked in the 8lood of my lusus which I just had to decapit8 myself.
4196
So listening to a cra88y asshole 8e all tickled with his own mediocre retorts isn't going to spoil my evening!
4196
Wow.
4196
Uh, good to know.
4196
I guess. ::::\
4196
What! It's so rude to dict8 hygiene procedure to a lady. Under any circumstance! Even for douchey loudmouths with delusions of leadership.
4196
May8e you should try to think a8out the dum8 things that fall out of your protein chute for once, Vantas.
4196
Anyway, you know my 8lood's the prettiest and you'd o8viously kill to have it.
4196
8S!
4196
Why would you hide 8ehind your lame gray anonymity then?
4196
You do realize everyone thinks that's totally lame, right????????
4196
Fine. Like anyone really cares! It's just lame and insecure.
4196
So why don't you tell me what I've got to do here???????? I await instruction from my 8igshot a8looded leader.
4196
Uggggggggh.
4196
Can't someone else do that?
4196
XXXXO
4196
8ut I h8 that guy!
4196
This is your command decision? Getting someone who h8s a guy to save his life? Pretty weak, 8oss!
4196
I know. I don't really understand it.
4196
It's just a really special kind of h8! It never goes away and it doesn't make a lot of sense.
4196
Oh god, what?
4196
Fuuuuuuuuck, WHAT are you talking a8out?
4196
Whoa really? Oh no shit, REALLY????????
4196
Karkat, holy fuck.
4196
So.
4196
8oring.
4196
Oh????????
4196
I hope you know I already wore out some good note-taking pens today. All the pens.
4196
All of them.
4196
Hahahahahahahaha, you don't even know how much I'm laughing at this.
4196
You aren't reading anything I say are you? You just want to talk and talk and talk.
4196
Oh, yeah.
4196
I started tuning you out.
4196
Are you done?
4196
Did you learn this crap from your awful romance movies?
4196
Hey asshole, stop watching movies for girls.
4196
Argh, ok! Man! Just let me connect to stupid 8oy-Dum8fuck so I don't have to listen to this anymore!
4196
What is it now!
4196
You do????????
4196
I mean.
4196
O8viously you do. Duh.
4196
What for?
4197
Um, ok.
4197
I can try.
4197
What does he know?
4197
Awkward? What do you mean?
4197
Settled down?
4197
Oh, only once!
4197
Are you sure you should trust him? I don't know if I would, 8ut hey I'm not the leader.
4197
This game is so stupid.
4197
Whew!!!!!!!!
4197
Oh, man.
4197
Since you're 8leeding I should ask Terezi what color your 8lood is.
4197
Ok, then I'll ask Jack.
4197
Dammit! Stupid lousy tightlipped sta8happy dou8le agents.
4197
Doesn't Trollian have some kind of viewport feature?
4197
Yeah ok, here we are a8out to em8ark on an espionage mission. A spying tool sounds totally useless!
4197
Another gr8 point, captain.
4197
Fine, I'll be right there.
4197
Just try not to lose too much of your mystery blood and die.
4241
Whaaaaaaaat.
4249
Taaaaaaaavros!
4249
Go outside and look at what I 8uilt for you! You are going to FLIP!
4250
What are you talking a8out. Look at my 8eatiful 8uilding. Don't you think it's a8out time someone got a little cre8tive with this game????????
4250
Everyone always wants to do things the 8oring way.
4250
Didn't we make a truce, Tavros? That we would try to 8e less 8oring from now on?
4250
You don't want to 8reak your truce with me, do you Tavros?
4250
Gr8. Now get clim8ing!
4250
Man. I knew it. Toreasnooze is 8ACK IN ACTION.
4250
I 8uilt that ramp 8ecause we were in a hurry to save your life, remem8er?
4250
A dead Tavros is even more 8oring than an alive and crippled Tavros 8y a slim margin.
4250
My stair structure is lovely and I'm not changing it.
4250
Now hop out of your wheel device and get clim8ing!!!!!!!!
4250
Or crawling. Whatever! Stop 8eing so helpless. It's pathetic.
4250
What's the rush! You're in the game, safe and sound. Look in the sky. Do you see any meteors? I sure don't!
4250
Siiiiiiiigh.
4250
You did not just use that excuse. We 8oth know you can commune with these things.
4250
Hey! Why don't you psychically command them to carry you up????????
4250
Oh my god that is a gr8 idea. Once again, leave it to Vriska to come up with the cre8tive solutions.
4250
What good would that do you?
4250
Whatever the purpose of this game is, it makes you work hard for it!
4250
That way you 8ecome stronger along the way and you are 8etter prepared for whatever's next.
4250
Remem8er when we used to flarp together???????? It was the exact same principle. And that's why you were always outmatched! You were too soft and not well prepared.
4250
Nothing comes easy, Tavros. That is why we go through the trials in the 8rooding caverns when we are young.
4250
To make sure we are strong when we come out!
4250
Do you remem8er the trials, Tavros?
4250
Well, I do, and they were a 8itch.
4250
8ut now that I think a8out it, it would make perfect sense if your trials were really easy 8y some mistake.
4250
That is why you are such a soggy phlegm sponge, and why you got picked 8y such a sad, frail little lusus!
4250
8ut that's ok, it pro8a8ly wasn't your fault. Just a 8ad 8r8k!
4250
You're lucky you have me as a server player, so I can challenge you and help you get strong.
4250
Now hop out of that seat and get clim8ing! I will deliver the device to you once you are at the top.
4250
Clim8, Pupa!
4250
Cliiiiiiiiim8!
4250
No!!!!!!!!
4250
You don't need help from your lame 8ull fairy. He is only holding you 8ack.
4250
God. Pathetic.
4250
This is getting frustrating.
4250
Why did I have to get stuck with the cripple? Just my luck.
4250
Do you have any idea how inconvenient this is? Do you have any sympathy for what I'm dealing with here?
4250
You're so inconsider8. You just sit there looking smug. It's infuri8ing to look at you.
4250
You haven't even thanked me! Or apologized for that matter!!!!!!!!
4250
uHHHHHHHH THANKS VRISKA, fOR sAVING UHH MY LIFE,
4250
uMMMMM IT SURE WAS 8RAVE AND HEROIC AND PRETTY OF YOU,
4250
aLSO uMMM dUHHH,,,, uMMM,,, i AM SORRY FROM THE 8OTTOM OF MY NOOK,,,,,,,,,,
4250
Seriously, how hard would that have 8een?
4250
For 8eing crippled, you ass!
4250
Yes.
4250
Say you're sorry.
4250
8ullshit!
4250
It's something called 8asic decency and civility you fudge8looded 8oor.
4250
Now get down on your useless wo88ly knees and apologize.
4250
>::::O
4251
Apologize, Pupa!
4251
Apologiiiiiiiize!!!!!!!!
4251
Say you're sorry for being a cripple! Wheeeeeeee!
4251
Aaaaaaaahahahahahahahaha!
4256
Hey, what's your deal!
4256
Shouldn't you 8e helping me out of this jam instead of fussing with my plum8ing????????
4256
That's silly. I made so many ramps, you wouldn't even 8elieve it.
4256
I specifically decided I wanted to 8uild something ugly and 8oring. It is now the land of ramps and yawns.
4256
That lousy snitch! May8e I should take his computer away so he can't go crying to fussyfangs anymore.
4256
No, don't!
4256
I'm only trying to help him. ::::(
4256
Fine.
4256
I'll do something NICE.
4256
I have an idea. I will 8e right 8ack.
4256
And for the record, I was going to do this anyway! I was just trying to make him a 8etter player first.
4256
In the meantime, how a8out I serve my client player the way I think is 8est, and you can do the same for yours????????
4260
Quit cleaning up after me!!!!!!!!
4260
You are so ridiculous.
4265
Flyyyyyyyy!
4269
Oh. That's cool I guess.
4269
Um, I don't know? Pro8a8ly 8uried in the stupid sand somewhere like all the others.
4269
The puzzle sucks! All these puzzles suck.
4269
If I have to help you put one more dum8 sla8 of 8oring rock into another stupid wall indent8tion I am going to put an indent8tion in my desk with my f8ce.
4269
Snore. These puzzles are for wigglers. I solved way 8etter puzzles than this in my heyday as Mindfang.
4269
Oh look some ruins. Oh look another mysterious recess in the wall! I wonder if something fits in there????????
4269
It pro8a8ly just opens a secret passage to more wall indent8tions. I am so over this puzzle.
4269
Tavros, let me let you in on a little secret a8out the lore of your land.
4269
It's 8oring!!!!!!!!
4269
The minds of your consorts are very soft and impressiona8le.
4269
As easily manipul8ed as all those imps you've 8een 8ossing around.
4269
I have picked apart their tiny little lizard 8rains and seen through all the smoke and mirrors of their riddles.
4269
I have gotten to the truth they are guarding. The great 8ig mystery 8ehind this planet. And you know what it is, Tavros?
4269
It's 8ullshit!
4269
Meaningless, 8oring, fanciful 8ullshit wrapped in flowery poems to keep you guessing.
4269
It all leads to one thing anyway, and that's what we should put our attention on.
4269
Real gamers cut to the chase. They power through all the nonsense and go for the gold.
4269
They cheat, Tavros.
4269
It is time you learned to start cheating.
4269
Well, it's a good start. You are 8ending the rules and getting stuff done.
4269
Ok I will admit, I am fairly impressed with your progress so far. Even though you still pro8a8ly haven't even killed a single enemy!!!!!!!
4269
No, don't 8other. I know you haven't.
4269
8ut may8e that's ok. May8e it's just your style, and your real strength is surrounding yourself with allies who are much stronger than you.
4269
Like me!
4269
I'm sure there is more than one way up the echeladder. In your case pro8a8ly the only way is to roll gently up the echeramp.
4269
The path of the invalid.
4269
8ut I think it's time to stop fucking around! You need to 8e challenged more.
4269
I have 8een designing a quest for you that should test your true limits.
4269
Yes.
4269
Yeah, well, after she got me in the game, Kanaya just left me in the lurch, pro8a8ly 8ecause she's dealing with her own crisis now.
4269
Which is just as well 8ecause I was starting to get nannied HARD. You wouldn't even 8elieve it.
4269
So I had some time to kill.
4269
I drew you a map!
4269
Here, take a look.
4269
It marks what will 8e your new destination. Where you will find the ultim8 challenge.
4270
I have determined from your consorts that there is a terri8le monster deep underground.
4270
It guards a hoard of treasure 8igger than either of us can imagine!
4270
It is called a denizen, and it is the 8oss of your whole planet.
4270
Tavros, you will go and face your denizen.
4270
It will 8e the most powerful adversary you have ever met.
4270
8ut you can handle it. I 8elieve in you!
4270
May8e! That is the risk you take 8y 8eing a 8rave adventurer.
4270
8ut it is a good opportunity to apply your cunning.
4270
May8e you can rally a huge army to 8end to your will and overwhelm the monster???????? Who knows! It is up to you.
4270
This is it, Tavros. It is time to sink or swim.
4270
No!!!!!!!!
4270
Oh god, every time. Always going and getting to others to 8ail you out.
4270
Anyway, Kanaya is missing in action, and Karkat has his head up his nook with his new sta88y h8friend.
4270
Neither can help you.
4270
Tavros, I know no8ody 8elieves me a8out this, pro8a8ly not even a gulli8le dope like you.
4270
8ut I actually care a8out your advancement as a player.
4270
Everything I have done has 8een to make you stronger!
4270
Ugh, you are useless!
4270
I'm done talking a8out this. Now shut up and point that cherry vehicle of yours toward the X on that map.
4270
Next stop, g8 seven. Let's go.
4270
This isn't optional. You know very well that I can make you go to that g8 whether you want to or not!
4270
8ut I would rather it not have to come to that.
4270
What will it 8e?
4270
Advance or advance?
4270
Oh one last thing.
4270
Equip your 8oy-Skylark outfit.
4270
This will 8e Pupa's last stand!
4270
I mean sit.
4270
Hahahahahahahaha.
4447
::::D
4447
Kaaaaaaaarkat!
4447
I'm sorry!
4447
8ut do you have any idea how funny this thing is? I mean this whole thing???????? I can't stop laughing!
4447
I'm not going to try, I'm just here to say this whole thing is ridiculous.
4447
We didn't really need you to pretend to 8e a little angry general to get any of this done.
4447
We kicked the queen out of there no sweat! It was easy. In fact, I did most of the work myself, right 8efore I found all the treasure and scaled all the rungs.
4447
Hey, I'm gone. I just think you should relax.
4447
You were wound up so tight through the whole adventure, and now here in the present you're a8out to explode. It's insuffera8le!
4447
Hahahahahahahaha.
4447
Hi.
4447
Karkat, shut up! This does not concern you.
4447
Tavros, it's ok. Really.
4447
So you don't feel that way a8out me! That's fine. I shouldn't have expected any different.
4447
I can deal with it! I am not a wimp like you. I roll with 8ad 8r8ks all the time. No 8iggie.
4447
In fact, I already have dealt with it. I was over here dealing with it while you were over there on the floor fooling around with your computer after a cute girl tried to kiss you for some reason.
4447
As it turned out, fooling around with your computer to........
4447
Go cry on future Karkat's shoulder a8out this????????
4447
Hahahaha. You are a str8nge and funny 8oy, Tavros.
4447
Karkat I said shut the fuck up!!!!!!!!
4447
Anyway, though totally unnecessary, your apology is accepted.
4447
Now pick yourself up off the floor so we can go wring some fucking treasure out of this misera8le magic rock!
4447
Actually, never mind, I'll 8e over there to help you with that too, kind of like I do with everything.
4447
Just lie still and try not to start crying or anything, and w8 a few minutes for your timeframe to catch up with mine.
4447
Exactly! I aaaaaaaam smarter than you. You see? You're learning!
4529
Hahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!
4529
You are 8oth ridiculous.
4529
I'm 8usy.
4529
I'm making my own plans! I'm a pretty 8ig deal, remem8er Karkat?
4529
Exactly!
4529
Do you guys realize you are sharing a key8oard and taking turns to argue with each other?
4529
That is kind of cute. ::::)
4553
Joooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooo
4553
oooooooohn!
4553
W8ke up!!!!!!!!
4553
It is 8ight groups of 8ight. I specifically counted them.
4553
It's sort of a thing I do.
4553
Wow. What a nerd!
4553
Um, possi8ly? This is the first time I have contacted you that I am aware of.
4553
John, give me a 8r8k! That was o8viously just my way of getting to know you.
4553
Or it will 8e, whenever I get around to it.
4553
Man.
4553
That was pro8a8ly Terezi! I should have known she would pull something like that. What a meddler.
4553
Yes. The pesky 8lind troll who licks her monitor and smells words and stuff. The one who got you killed. I'm sure of it!
4553
Marquise Spinneret Mindfang. ::::)
4553
Spinneret! Marquise is a title, stupid.
4553
And you don't have to worry a8out me manipul8ting you to your death!
4553
It is completely 8eneath me. Unlike her, I plan on taking the high road.
4553
You see John, you and I actually have some things in common, 8ut you couldn't possi8ly understand why yet.
4553
So I'm planning on helping you!
4553
Hahahahahahahaha.
4553
You can't sleep now, John!
4553
What a8out J8de????????
4553
She's fine. I can see her right now!
4553
8ut she will not 8e for long if you don't get her into your session.
4553
Wait!!!!!!!!
4553
Where the hell do you think you're going to go? You don't even have your copy of the game yet!
4553
Easy! Just w8 around for a few minutes.
4553
See, John? You need me to advance.
4553
Even though you were going to do this stuff anyway, it turns out I am the reason you were going to do it anyway in the first place!
4553
Your timeline is my we8, and suddenly you are all tangled up in it, wriggling and helpless.
4553
Isn't that cooooooool????????
4553
Yeah!
4553
Fuck you!!!!!!!!
4561
She's asleep!
4561
She sure seems to sleep a lot. She sort of reminds me of my goo8er teamm8.
4561
He napped through most of the adventure, and was practically useless.
4561
Hahahaha, no way! Karkat is so up tight, he hardly slept a wink over the whole 600 hour span of our quest.
4561
He didn't even wake up on the moon until AFTER we won the game, hahahahahahahaha.
4561
What a loser.
4561
John, you are pretty weird! I can see why you would piss him off so much.
4561
Tell me a8out it!
4561
Speaking of telling me a8out things...
4561
Why don't you tell me what you were just dreaming a8out that was so important, fellow Prospit dreamer????????
4561
Prospit is the 8est. Derse is where all the rejects hang out. Am I right?
4561
Yes, I know all that! That place is the 8attlefield, which is where your dream self lives now. You will appear there any time you go to sleep.
4561
Prospit dreamers are supposed to end up there eventually. If they're any good, that is. ::::)
4561
8ut you got there so much sooner. Normally a dreamer's journey to the 8attlefield will not 8e so spectacularly sudden and violent. Meteoric, if you will!
4561
8ut you didn't answer my question! What was so important that you wanted to go 8ack to sleep again for?
4561
What's that?
4561
Oh, you mean the adult male human who lived in your hive?
4561
Haha, I was wondering a8out that. I was like, what the hell is this guy doing in this kid's hive? Where is his lusus? Is he an orphan contending with some sort of meddlesome grownup squatter????????
4561
Yes, I just chalked it up as generic alien weirdness and didn't think too much a8out it. Just another series of strange exhi8its from an inferior civiliz8tion.
4561
::::\
4562
W8! 8efore you wander too far off course like a doofus, you need to know how to get to a return node!
4562
So you can get 8ack to your computer. Here, hang on, I am making you a map.
4562
What!!!!!!!!
4562
Ugh. She is still trying to one up me I see. Even preempting my awesome helpfulness!
4562
When did she do that? I mean from my perspective? Do you think she already did it, or hasn't done it yet?
4562
I don't know. Forget it.
4562
I will show her though. I will show her the meaning of helpfulness.
4562
I will help this little human nerd under the ta8le. The very same ta8le you dined at, while I w8ted on you prong and fucking nu8.
4562
God, no!!!!!!!! With a human? Gross.
4562
You won't win? Says who?????????
4562
Well, ok yes, you are screwed. And so are we.
4562
8ut so what!
4562
Just 8ecause you are going to fail doesn't mean it won't 8e any fun along the way!
4562
8y the looks of things, you have a very exciting 24 hours ahead of you.
4562
It'll 8e one hell of a reckoning!
4563
Yes, and 8esides. Continuing on this path and 8ringing Jade into the game I think you will agree is very important!
4563
And not just 8ecause she is your friend and you would 8e kind of upset if she died.
4563
Again.
4563
8ecause you need to complete your prototyping chain!
4563
Only when all players have entered with a prototyped kernel does the 8attlefield assume its final form.
4563
That form prepares Skaia to grow the new universe you will cre8te.
4563
Or in this case, fail to cre8te. 8ut whatever!
4563
That is no reason to deter you from completing worthwhile game o8jectives.
4563
Yeah! You didn't realize that yet?
4563
8oy. How clueless can you get.
4563
What a stupid question! It is the point of the game. It's what happens when you win, and winning is the only point of anything.
4563
Anyway, you should 8e glad it's the point. And you should 8e glad your predecessors were not such a sad sack group of players like you guys.
4563
Otherwise your universe would not exist, seeing as we cre8ted it 8y 8eing incredi8le in every way.
4563
Yep. You're welcome. ::::D
4563
Not knowing what to think a8out things appears to 8e your specialty!
4563
::::P
4563
That's the spirit, John!
4563
That is a winner's attitude, and there is always hope for someone who has that.
4563
Pff.
4563
Laaaaaaaame.
4572
John, why are you standing around wasting time????????
4572
Enough to make me wonder what the hell your deal is!
4572
Dammit, John.
4572
Stop sounding smarter than me. It is un8ecoming of someone so inferior.
4572
Yeah, I know.
4572
It seems a little too sunny for my liking.
4572
The life I left 8ehind wasn't so hot, to 8e honest.
4572
Why don't we not talk a8out that!
4572
What are these movies, anyway? They look just awful.
4572
Are they a8out clowns?
4572
::::|
4572
John, even though your title is quite amusing and pro8a8ly kind of cute, that movie sounds hilariously 8ad!
4572
Is this like the Earth equivalent of Gru8tu8e or something?
4572
Man. I am not watching this shitty video. It looks so 8ad!
4572
Ok, I will 8e sure 8ookmark it and la8el it "dum8 kid's retarded nonsense."
4572
8y the way! Why aren't you using your computer glasses to talk suddenly????????
4572
This device seems less efficient, and doesn't look as cool!
4573
How will you duplic8 it? Isn't it smashed out there on your lawnring?
4573
Oh, gr8.
4573
Uh........
4573
John?
4573
Ok, I will slide you a 8r8k 8ecause clearly your 8lock was just ransacked.
4573
8ut may8e you want to put that away? Somewhere discreet, where you usually keep it?
4573
There is at least one girl spying on you right now, you know.
4573
Your pail is showing, stupid!!!!!!!!
4574
Yes! Come on, will you take a hint and show some decorum????????
4574
Man! Nothing, really. It's just........
4574
Ok, may8e humans don't really have any sense of shame over this sort of thing?
4574
Oh.
4574
Haha, yeah, of course!
4574
That's what I was talking a8out. Your cleaning 8ucket.
4574
In troll culture we consider cleaning products to 8e really indecent or something!
4574
I am 8lushing furiously a8out it right now. Please try to 8e sensitive to my cultural ways and understandings.
4574
Thank you, John. That is very gentlemanly of you.
4574
Now will you quit shitting around and get on with it!!!!!!!! God.
4574
That isn't my real name, you dope!
4574
I ain't telling you that!
4574
It's a sekret. :::;)
4574
You don't even need to say that. I can see you rolling your eyes, remem8er?
4624
What.
4624
The hell........
4624
Are you doing!!!!!!!!
4624
John, stop kissing that adult 8rown male human computer at once.
4624
Man. It is just another waste of time.
4624
Everything you do is a huge waste.
4624
A stupid pointless 8unch of w8stey w8stey w8stes.
4624
You have important things to do!
4624
Remem8er Jade????????
4625
Noooooooo!!!!!!!!
4625
XXXXO
4625
What the fuck are you doing now!
4625
No, that's not what I mean!
4625
I know that's what you're going to do.
4625
You're just not supposed to do it now!
4625
You are supposed to do something else first. And then fly up. It's right here on your timeline. 8y attempting to do the thing you're not supposed to do yet, you are just wasting more of our time!!!!!!!!
4625
I told you, that's my role playing name, not my real one! So your weak 8urn means nothing.
4625
Oh, yes John. I am really going to know what that stupid Earth game is, just 8ecause you put troll in front of it. Stupid.
4625
Pffffffff, dou8t it.
4625
Now shut up and do what you are going to do next!
4625
8ecause.
4625
That's ridiculous!
4625
That would 8e a ridiculous way for us to do things.
4625
Okaaaaaaaay, shut up!
4625
Fine. I will hold your hand every step of the way, since that's apparently how you want to do this.
4625
I said shut up!
4625
Look, you are a8out to make yourself a new outfit, and THEN you will fly up and install the game.
4625
8ecause you look like an idiot!
4625
Seriously, it's a good thing I did decide to 8other you now. Otherwise you would go through the game looking like a little weenie 8oy-Skylark.
4625
It is the most terri8le, gutless class for wimpy losers, ones who have no idea how to handle themselves when a girl talks to them and stuff.
4625
Yes, exactly! It is 8eneath you, John.
4625
You are clearly much 8etter than that. You should dress like it.
4625
Hahahahahahahaha!
4625
I watched you actually say that with a str8 f8ce. Oh my god.
4625
Trolls are an extremely fashion-minded race, John. You should make a note of this, since you pretend to 8e a scientist or something.
4625
John, that is an outr8geous thing to say. You don't even know how important the fashions are, so 8e quiet.
4625
Look at that! You counted out 8 a's for me, John! That is so thoughtful of you.
4625
Really????????
4625
<33333333
4625
I know you are, John.
4625
Now empty out your sylladex and let's see what sort of killer gear we can make for you. 8ut do it fast!
4632
This is the most ridiculous pile of useless crap I have ever seen.
4632
Why did you pick up all this junk???????? Rocks, mushrooms, shoes........
4632
Jegus, John.
4632
Yes. Jegus!
4632
I have no idea! It's something Terezi has 8een saying non stop for some reason.
4632
It is weirdly infectious.
4632
What is it, some sort of human profanity?
4632
8ooooooooring.
4632
John! Is that a frog I see there?
4632
How do you have a frog already????????
4632
It seems awfully early in your game for you to 8e finding frogs. Your session sure is weird!
4632
John, shut your trap! We are in a hurry here.
4632
Ok, I think I can make you a completely faaaaaaaa8ulous outfit using this trash, and may8e some other stuff around your hive.
4632
8ut you have to do exactly what I say!
4632
H8RRY 8P!!!!!!!!!
4632
Oops.
4634
Yes! Isn't it awesome?
4634
Fuck that.
4634
This is a really hot look for you, John. It makes you look a million times more cool, instead of some kind of overa8sconding daggerlance fl8ling pansy.
4634
Now move your ass!
4634
Go go go go go go go go!!!!!!!!
4635
D::::
4635
Yessssssss.
4636
Yes, I know that, dummy! I am in complete command of your timeline, remem8er?
4636
We will not speak again for a while. 8ut for me it will only 8e a moment.
4636
I do not envy the Serketless coldspell you are a8out to endure, John.
4636
Man, calm down! It will only 8e a couple of hours or so.
4636
Sweet Jegus, I have clearly done a num8er on you to engender such a frothing o8session so quickly.
4636
Not surprising. It's just the 8urden that comes with 8eing so damned awesome. 8ut you will figure that out soon enough John, 8ecause I have you well on your way.
4636
Phase two of my program for you 8egins in a little while.
4636
In the meantime, try not to get corrupted 8y anyone too lame. Especially no8ody with 8rown text or gray text, or any shit ugly color at all for that matter.
4636
8ye, John........
4636
W8.
4636
John what?
4636
Ok. Til next time, Mr. Anderson.
4654
Yes, you told him 8ro!
4654
I distinctly remem8er you telling him a8out stairs. 8ut he didn't listen.
4654
He never listens! None of you do, really.
4654
And now all of your extra lives are waaaaaaaasted.
4654
What a 8unch of losers! I'm outta here.
4654
You doofus!!!!!!!!
4684
John! What the hell. There are so many things wrong with what you just said.
4684
First of all, who told you you could just hassle me without warning like this? That's not how this works!
4684
Yes, 8ecause we are trolling you! Those are the rules. We get to 8ug you any time we feel like, and you have to sit there and t8ke it like a chump.
4684
I am too 8usy to 8e fielding your nonsense at the drop of one of your a8surd human hats. I have a ridiculous num8er of irons in the fire. You will speak to me only when I am ready to contact you, is that clear????????
4684
Secondly, I am very pissed off that you figured out my name.
4684
Dammit!
4684
Who told you?
4684
I will find out who told you. And then I will m8ke them p8y.
4684
What video?
4684
John, the way you descri8e movies makes them sound extremely stupid. Why would I want to watch this crap????????
4684
XXXX|
4684
::::?
4685
What is it now!
4874
Psssssssst.
4874
Hey 8rave leader.
4874
John!
4874
Stop ignoring me. My messages should receive top priority.
4874
Who are you talking to? I don't appreciate 8eing snu88ed like this. How ungr8ful can you get!
4874
Maaaaaaaan.
4874
Come oooooooon........
4874
W8ting?
4874
Oh! I guess so. I hardly even noticed! I am like this really huge deal, and have a lot of stuff to keep me 8usy, remem8er?
4874
Don't 8eat yourself up a8out it!
4874
I was the one who put you to sleep.
4874
Yeah!
4874
Yes, that seems to 8e the limit to what I can do to your primitive species.
4874
I guess our 8rains don't really work the same way? Who knows!
4874
Duh! So much more, John. I have a lot of gr8 powers.
4874
When we have more time, I will tell you all a8out them.
4874
John, soon you will understand that you are meant to rise to gr8tness.
4874
This can't possi8ly happen unless you are challenged.
4874
There will 8e times when your limits are tested. This is one of those times!
4874
I know this 8ecause I can see your future right here in front of me. You should trust me!
4874
Oh John, this should 8e so o8vious to you 8y now.
4874
You are going to 8ecome a gr8 hero, that much is sure.
4874
8ut I want to 8e the one responsi8le for it!
4874
And now I am pretty much guaranteed to 8e.
4874
::::)
4874
You don't have to think! Just leave the thinking to me.
4874
All you have to do is dig deep down, find your hero powers, and get yourself out of this jam.
4874
You can do it, John. 8e the hero!
4874
Just like in one of your movies a8out sweaty, rugged adult human males.
4875
It was ok.
4875
I admit it was a little 8etter than I expected.
4875
8ut who cares! Let's not get sidetracked 8y films a8out wounded, muscular renegades.
4875
8y the way, John, have you ever considered growing your hair out?
4875
I 8et it would look fa8ulous.
4875
I don't know a8out that!
4875
I have an eye for fashion. 8 of them, in fact!
4875
Oh yeah. Whoops. ::::\
4875
Don't 8e a8surd, John.
4875
Of course I realized that would happen.
4875
It was pretty much the whole point, you goof!
4875
Jegus, calm down.
4875
Relaaaaaaaax.
4875
Listen, John.
4875
Regardless of what I did, he is already here.
4875
I know this consequence will 8e hard for you to accept, 8ut whenever you feel angry or confused a8out it, just repeat this to yourself.
4875
It should 8ecome your mantra!
4875
He is already here.
4875
Say it, John!
4875
It means what it sounds like! He's already here!!!!!!!!
4875
Here in our session, trying to hunt us down! Man, this should 8e elementary to you 8y now.
4875
No matter what you or I or any of us did, Jack's here now. That's the reality!
4875
And if I didn't stop you, it wouldn't have changed the reality for us here. We'd still 8e hiding on this rock, and he'd still 8e out there, sniffing around for us.
4875
He wouldn't just disappear! That's not how this time stuff works.
4875
All that REALLY would have happened is I would have allowed you to do something you weren't supposed to do!
4875
You would have prototyped with your pretty 8lue doll, 8ecause of course deep down you know you are o8sessed with me.
4875
And then you and all your friends would exist in a splintered timeline. And you wouldn't even 8e a8le to talk to me anymore! ::::(
4875
And then you'd 8e doooooooomed.
4875
I mean, more doomed than you are already. :::;)
4875
Trust me, I am really smart. I have this all figured out.
4875
You just answered your own question!
4875
I did it 8ecause I wanted to 8e the one responsi8le for cre8ting him.
4875
8ecause, John.
4875
It only makes sense that I would be the one to cre8te him.
4875
Since I am also going to 8e the one to kill him.
4876
Don't 8e that way.
4876
Just 8ecause you have your whole reckoning ahead of you to kill Jack, and somehow fail, doesn't mean you have to 8e 8itter a8out it.
4876
Karkat doesn't know nothing a8out anything.
4876
He never really appreci8ted how powerful I 8ecame. No8ody did! I am easily the strongest troll 8y far.
4876
I am also extremely lucky! That is one of my powers, John. 8eing super lucky, and making my foes super UNlucky. ::::)
4876
Yes, and I've got all of it. I am completely untoucha8le.
4876
Nope, I don't have to 8e careful! Too lucky for caution to matter anymore. Them's the 8r8ks!
4876
8ut don't worry, once all is said and done in your session, and 8y some incredi8ly lucky 8r8k of your own you manage to survive the scratch, we might actually get the chance to meet.
4876
And if so, assuming I haven't gotten too 8ored w8ting around and mopped the floor with Jack already, may8e we can take him down together!
4876
John, that's something a loser would say, come on.
4876
You should have no reason to 8e scared of me.
4876
8y the time I am through with you, you should 8e even stronger than me.
4876
This is the way it ought to 8e, I think. ::::D
4876
It is a distinct possi8ility.
4876
What?
4876
John, what the hell are you trying to say?
4876
Whaaaaaaaat????????
4876
You shouldn't listen to anything that loudmouth says.
4876
He had his shot 8eing in charge, and failed misera8ly.
4876
It's my turn now. Scratch that.
4876
OUR turn.
4876
Now quit whining and get yourself out of this mess.
4876
Dig deep down inside that pink, nerdy little torso of yours, find your awesome hero mojo, and do what you're a8out to do.
4876
I will talk to you again after you figure it out.
4876
8yyyyyyyye! <3
4884
Fly, Pupa!!!!!!!!
4884
Flyyyyyyyy!
4884
Hahahahahahahaha!
4884
No8ody, just some loser.
4884
Look at that, you did it!
4957
Aaaaaaaahahahahahahahaha!
4957
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!
4957
Oh my god, I cannot 8elieve how hilariously pathetic that whole exchange was.
4957
Even 8y your wretched standards, Toreadork!
4957
Hahahahahahahaha, oh god I can't 8reathe!!!!!!!!
4957
A8solutely priceless. XXXXD
4957
Pff. Tavros, sometimes your stupidity surprises even me.
4957
Next time you decide to open your heart to an alien girl........
4958
Make sure her chat client isn't 8eing holographically projected for all to see, ok?
4959
It was so em8arrassing just reading that Tavros. I'm em8arrassed!
4959
I am actually feeling genuine em8arrassment. Your o8scene incompetence is actually polluting my otherwise pristine composure. Nice going!
4959
Jade let you down too easy. She's too nice! Someone's got to tear into you for that appalling display, and once again, guess who's shoulders that falls on?
4959
That's right. Vriska's, as usual.
4959
Hey, I'm nice when it matters, and where it doesn't strangul8te the critical development of people I give a shit a8out, ok?
4959
Really I don't know what you see in her. She is completely useless, like you.
4959
W8, of course!!!!!!!! It makes perfect sense. You and she represent the ideal matespritship, how could I have 8een so 8lind!
4959
Two perfectly pointless gru8s in a bucket.
4959
Oh will you please stop going on a8out your fucking self esteem.
4959
I will say this much a8out her, she was right a8out that. How insuffera8le can you get, prattling on and on a8out how confident you are.
4959
Tavros, you give confidence a 8ad name. I gave you all the chances in the world to earn it, to earn REAL confidence, and you failed.
4959
You couldn't even do the one little thing I asked you to! The one thing that would have made you man up once and for all.
4959
So instead you flew away and cried, and decided to sleep away your sorrow for the rest of the adventure.
4959
Do you have any idea how sick that made me? Everything a8out you makes me sick.
4959
When you talk a8out your self confidence, I throw up a little. You don't know what confidence is. Ro8o-legs don't give you confidence, that 8n't no more true than saying my ro8o-arm gave me mine. See what I mean?
4959
Your confidence is faker than even the great Rufio himself, Lord of the Unreal. It's pure fiction, a false fakey fraudy con jo8 from a wimpy loser charlatan 8ullshit artist.
4959
It's shallow and nause8ting, just like you. Do us all a favor and SHUT UP a8out it.
4959
Yeah right!!!!!!!!
4959
I'll 8elieve that when I see it, chump.
4959
Jade is an idiot.
4959
A useless, 8oring no8ody. What has she done for her party other than fuck up every step of the way? What does she ever do 8ut take naps and get in trou8le?
4959
She's awful, and you deserve each other. Oh w8, except she h8tes you!!!!!!!! Ahahahahahahahaha. Even the 8oring pointless girl h8s you, talk a8out a guy who can't get a 8r8k.
4959
Though I guess she's not compleeeeeeeetely useless. ::::)
4959
Ok, Tavros, I gave her credit for something, so I'll give you credit for something too.
4959
Your plan to control her lusus really wasn't a 8ad idea!
4959
And using your a8ility to "save her life" (lol) was a pretty good way to test how effective your powers are across sessions.
4959
Pretty good way to practice, to know where you stand!
4959
Practicing your a8ilities is important, so when it comes down to using them for something that really matters, you know you're ready for prime time.
4959
I know this first hand.
4959
I got lots and lots and LOTS of practice with your little guinea pig friend. ::::D
4959
So really, turns out she wasn't so useless at all! Far from it.
4959
Not really the point!
4959
The point is I'm trying to pay you a compliment.
4959
At this point, you are so sad and disgusting, you should treat anything nice anyone has to say a8out you like a chest full of shimmering 8oon8ucks.
4959
Like I said! Your plan was solid.
4959
Controlling the guardian to go after Jack was a fine idea. Sure would stir some shit up! 8etter than 8eing an insignificant stuttering piece of trash all the time, I say.
4959
And you were definitely on to something a8out doing it "irregardless" (lol) of her wishes.
4959
8ecause it's for her own good! That's what winners do. They do what is right for someone they care a8out even if the other person does nothing 8ut 8itch and moan and act ungr8ful a8out it. 8etter you learned l8 than never.
4959
In fact, I would go as far as saying that if you went ahead with her plan against her wishes, it MIGHT just earn you a smidgen of respect from me.
4959
We'll see.
4959
There's really just one catch.
4960
The catch is it's not going to work!
4960
Are you even listening to me? Man, clear the Rufio wax out of your ears.
4960
You couldn't sic the guardian on Noir even if you were inclined. Not even if I were to MAKE you inclined! :::;)
4960
8ecause you are dealing with a pro here. I already thought of that.
4960
I thought of everything!
4961
The guardian is not going to attack the agents who engineered him in the first place.
4961
Or who I should say were "encouraged" (lol) to engineer him.
4962
I was striking a mutually 8eneficial arrangement! This is often the most effective way to manipul8 others.
4962
I just sort of gave them an idea. Nudged them along in the direction of seizing more power, which they wanted to do anyway.
4962
Remem8er, I already have a lot of experience getting these simple minded agents to march to my drum 8eat.
4962
I was exiling them left and right in our session! I'm an expert at this 8y now.
4963
Tavros, at this point it should 8e o8vious.
4963
I am the unseen hand 8ehind every major event in their session, and to some extent, their whole lives.
4963
At least those events not happening 8y the volition of their own natural incompetence!
4963
Don't you think this is how it should 8e? Shouldn't the greatest player leave her fingerprints on every step of the rise to power of her ultim8 nemesis?
4964
8ut you must agree, 8ecause you were copycatting my idea.
4964
You were 8razenly inserting yourself into Jade's history. The self-insertion plan was my idea, and it's revolting and cowardly for you to deny it.
4964
Hahahaha, sure. Whatever you say.
4964
It's incredi8ly sad how outclassed you are. It's actually depressing that you thought you could 8eat me at my own game. And then most sickeningly of all, you don't own up it!
4964
I have every angle covered already. The human session is on full Serket lockdown. Any effort you make to disrupt my plans will 8e laugha8le, just like everything you have ever done in your life.
4964
The only thing left to do now is prepare to kill Jack myself, and save everyone's ungrateful asses.
4964
It's a shame you're not strong enough to take him on with me. Too 8ad you spent so long sleeping instead of tur8o-leveling like me.
4964
We might have made a pretty awesome team.
4964
Oh well.
4965
Nice deduction!
4965
Wrong, excruci8tingly linear, and laced with the sort of a8solutes morons like to throw around........
4965
8ut nice!
4966
Yeeeeeeees?
4966
Go on.
4966
Yeah! That's the spirit.
4966
Pretty weakslime threat there, 8ut it's a start.
4966
Tell you what.
4966
If you can find me in this la8, you can have at me.
4966
I'll even give you a free shot! No funny 8usiness or anything.
4966
I'll 8e w8ing. <3
4981
Yes, exactly! Pretty exciting, isn't it?
4981
What's that mean?
4981
John.
4981
Would you like me to put you to sleep?
4981
John, I am clearly involved in your rise to power now regardless. That can't 8e changed!
4981
I am giving you the option, 8ecause at some point a hero has to start making choices.
4981
Once you take a 8r8k from hunting treasure and stop getting distracted 8y side quests, you eventually realize that's what this game is all a8out.
4981
The choices you make affect the destiny of the universe you cre8te, as well as the type of hero you 8ecome.
4981
It would have 8een nice if someone was around to explain all this to me, and let me have some control over my own f8.
4981
I had to do this a much less pleasant way. I'm sparing you that indignity.
4981
8esides, it's not like you're some loser who doesn't know how to make tough decisions.
4981
So what'll it 8e, John?
4981
Am I hearing a "yes," John?
4981
You got it. <3
4986
8888)
5366
Hi John.
5366
Your guardians are not here!
5366
Yes, they are in another castle. Don't worry, you'll find them later.
5366
In a while! Man, settle down.
5366
I am telling you that you will find them after a little more questing around in your awesome 8lue godhood. So why don't you relax and talk to me for a while?
5366
Why don't you have your hood up, 8y the way?
5366
You look gr8 with the hood up. And anyway, we should 8e showing a little pride as the only ones to make god tier, don't you think?
5366
John, are you mad at me?
5366
Then what's the matter?
5366
I still find it a little hard to understand the sentimentality you attach to these adult humans.
5366
It just seems so strange to me. 8ut hey, that's alien culture for you.
5366
Yeah, sort of.
5366
Except I never liked mine that much. ::::\
5366
Even after I prototyped her, things were pretty chilly 8etween us! I spent most of my adventure avoiding her. Haha.
5366
John.
5366
Are you suuuuuuuure you're not mad at me?
5366
8ecause I tricked you into getting killed!!!!!!!!
5366
Would it help if I said I was sorry?
5366
Yes, I am here.
5366
Sorry, I wasn't sure what to say for a moment.
5366
I am just so incredi8ly relieved you are not angry with me.
5366
Yes, I did.
5366
I don't know, John. You'd 8e surprised how often people resent it when you try to help them!
5366
8ut see, you really get it. That's why you're special.
5366
<33333333
5366
Yes.
5366
Well.
5366
Not exactly.
5367
I know how this is pro8a8ly going to sound, especially to a human.
5367
8ut I just killed someone.
5367
Not exactly.
5367
I'm not sure what his deal is. I haven't seen him in a while.
5367
8ut we are not under attack.
5367
Not yet, at least.
5367
He was a friend.
5367
Someone from our team.
5367
It's a little complicated.
5367
Yes.
5367
8ut really, that's not why I killed him. He was no match for me, and I could have just incapacit8ed him or flown away or whatever.
5367
The truth is I killed him 8ecause at the time, I thought I wanted to, and sort of felt like I finally had to.
5367
8ecause enough was enough! You don't even know how frustr8ing it was to 8e friends with him.
5367
I used to really like him and always wanted to help him get stronger, so that he might stand a fucking chance to actually make it on our world.
5367
8ut he was just soooooooo weak and indecisive. He wouldn't change!
5367
And when he tried to change, it was too little and too l8. Always l8. L8ey L8ey L88888888.
5367
Too l8 to kiss me.
5367
Too l8 to kill me.
5367
He couldn't do it when I really needed him to. So when I saw he was actually serious a8out trying to kill me now of all times...
5367
I just got SO AAAAAAAANGRY. I am still a 8it upset thinking a8out it.
5367
So I killed him.
5367
And I'm pretty sure he's dead for good now.
5367
I know!
5367
I know our races are completely different. And I really h8 the idea of you thinking worse of me 8ecause of this.
5367
8ut I don't have anyone else to talk to a8out it!
5367
No no no no no no no no!
5367
I mean, yeah, they're fine. 8ut I can't talk to them!
5367
For one thing, they would pro8a8ly just 8e pissed off at me for killing Tavros.
5367
And more importantly, there's no waaaaaaaay I could tell them how I really feel a8out it.
5367
Horri8le!!!!!!!!
5367
If any of my friends knew that, they would think I'm weak.
5367
Do you?
5367
We aren't savages, you dope!
5367
Uh, yeah........
5367
Let's say close enough!
5367
Yeah, see.
5367
This is where our cultures clash, I think.
5367
It would 8e difficult to explain exactly how killing is viewed on our planet with all the nuance involved.
5367
It just isn't the 8lack and white thing humans seem to think it is!
5367
On my world, I would 8e completely vindic8ed for killing him! He is far lower on the hemospectrum than me. He managed to disrespect me time and time again, 8ut I kept letting him live! In fact, the amount of slack I cut him would 8e considered scandalous 8y those in my class.
5367
I had every reason to kill him. And yet...
5367
I feel 8ad a8out it like a lame weak fudge8lood, just like he was.
5367
And the fact that I feel 8ad is why I'm sort of freaking out right now!
5367
No. That's not how it works.
5367
I'm supposed to 8e just fine with it.
5367
This was sort of like a test, and I'm afraid I might 8e failing.
5367
Well, it was the first time I killed some8ody.
5367
W8! Ok, that's not really true. What I meant was, it was the first time I killed some8ody I cared a8out.
5367
Yes. Sort of a lot, actually. 8ut there was a really good reason for that!
5367
Oh, it doesn't matter. Pro8a8ly many thousands.
5367
God, I know how this sounds! 8ut I had to feed her. My lusus I mean. I've 8asically 8een playing this role as a slave in the food chain my whole life. It is what she selected me to do.
5367
Hell yes.
5367
Yeah, 8ut I never felt anything a8out it. It was just normal life for me.
5367
Yeah. OH!
5367
Ok, that's not quite right. He's the second person I cared a8out who I killed.
5367
Man, I always forget a8out her!
5367
I guess she wound up getting me 8ack pretty good though, so we're even.
5367
Oh, also, TECHNICALLY I attempted to kill that same guy around the same time.
5367
8ut I just wound up paralyzing him! Oops, hahahaha.
5367
8ut man. That was sweeps ago.
5367
I think I had a really juvenile attitude a8out killing 8ack then. I think I was trying too hard?
5367
I was always really o8sessed with 8eing the 8est at stuff, and I guess I was trying to 8e precocious in that respect as well, and prove to everyone how 8rutal I could be.
5367
8ut I was such a confused kid! I didn't know anything a8out what killing really means. I was trying to fake it, and it caused me nothing 8ut pro8lems.
5367
Yeah, I know. I wish we didn't have to 8e so different. I'm just trying to 8e honest with you, 8ecause like I said, I have nowhere else to go.
5368
I guess I have to admit I don't actually know that much a8out humans either!
5368
Other than that you are all pretty soft and mild mannered and seem to 8e friendlier, and think killing totally sucks.
5368
I really have no clue what it means to grow up as a human, though.
5368
8ut I do know what it means grow up as a troll, and what's expected of us.
5368
When a troll comes of age, you 8etter 8elieve it means they're going to start killing.
5368
It's what we do as a race. We are very effective conquerors, and as such, we practically domin8 our galaxy. Or... used to.
5368
The ones that don't learn to 8e ruthless? They're 8etter off DEAD.
5368
And the reality is, it won't 8e long until they are. That's just life for us.
5368
Well, thanks John. That's nice of you to say. 8ut let's face it, it doesn't fucking matter anymore, since our whole race was wiped out!
5368
May8e for the 8est, when you think a8out it.
5368
8ut at least paradox space gave us some purpose 8efore wiping us out, right?
5368
At least we got the chance to cre8te you guys, and all those twinkly stars you used to look up at.
5368
So 8ecause we got that chance, it means we'll never actually get to come of age and enter troll society, and see if we got what it takes.
5368
8ut that doesn't mean we stop growing up!
5368
I think the game knows it's always gonna 8e played 8y kids, and it always rigs it so they enter right around the cusp of sexual maturity, whatever the race is.
5368
Which kinda makes sense, since if they succeed, they've got their whole lives ahead of them to do whatever the hell they're going to do in their universe, like start repopul8ing and whatnot.
5368
That means the game also knows it's got to deal with all these damn kids who are coming of age while playing it!
5368
I really think how successfully they mature is tied to success in the game. It challenges the players in all the ways they need to 8e challenged to grow, which is different for every individual, and veeeeeeeery different for every race.
5368
I don't think we were so hot at that aspect of the game. In fact, I'm sure we were quite awful. Hell, even I wasn't that gr8 at it! I actually just kinda fell ass 8ackwards into the god tier, to 8e honest.
5368
8ut what really gets me is this didn't even occur to me until just now, while I was sitting around thinking a8out it.
5368
It was so o8vious!
5368
That was why the game split us up into two teams.
5368
It knew as we came of age, we'd pro8a8ly start killing each other.
5368
So it just provided the stage. Red team vs. 8lue. It was so simple! All we had to do was what we were naturally inclined to. It might have worked out 8etter for us.
5368
Yeah, you'd think that would 8e counter productive! 8ut then again, may8e not.
5368
If we really did take the team thing seriously, and started killing each other, may8e it would have meant more god tiers?
5368
May8e all of us would have made it????????
5368
Damn, can you imagine? We would have 8reezed through the game even faster, killed the king without a sweat. May8e claimed the reward 8efore Jack even showed up?
5368
Or if he did, may8e we could have 8eaten him then and there instead of scurrying off like cowards!!!!!!!!
5368
In retrospect we failed at this so spectacularly, I am amazed, and kind of ashamed.
5368
It turned out that the only one of us with the guts to kill someone was already DEAD! Hahahahahahahaha. And 8oy, did I have it coming.
5368
Yes, she was a ghost, and then 8ecame a ro8ot. Then she 8ecame a THOUSAND ro8ots. Then Jack killed them all 8ut one. Then she 8lew up.
5368
Oh, and she also had that exact 8izarre laptop you are using right now. How weird is that?
5368
Not crazy enough, apparently!
5368
Actually, this is pro8a8ly Karkat's fault.
5368
When it comes down to it, he was pro8a8ly too good a leader! He actually did manage to get the two teams to work together toward the same goal. It could have easily deterior8ed into a feud otherwise.
5368
He was just so loud and annoying and o8sessed with leadership. He wouldn't shut up! So it was just easier to go along with his plans.
5368
He sure kept us working together, 8ut in the end I think we paid for it.
5368
It wasn't natural! Pretty fitting, really, since he's kind of a freak himself. He's not even on the hemospectrum, the weirdo.
5368
I really dou8t he would have handled it as a leader if the shit ever hit the whirling device.
5368
He likes to pretend he's all vicious and 8loodthirsty, 8ut I know he 8n't got that in him. I have a sense for these things.
5368
He'd 8e so pissed if he heard me say this, 8ut I think he'd cut it 8etter as a human than as a troll.
5372
What a8out him?
5372
Hmmmmmmmm.
5372
Yeah, you're right.
5372
And to tell you the truth, part of the reason I wanted to kill him was to protect them. It's not just a8out glory you know.
5372
8ecause if I don't do it, then who will?
5372
Yes, I know a8out your plan.
5372
I guess two plans are 8etter than one, right?
5372
Man, I don't know anymore.
5372
It's one reason I'm freaking out a8out this. A8out feeling 8ad a8out a simple, perfectly justifia8le killing.
5372
If I can't handle that, doesn't it mean I'm not as strong as I thought? What hope do I have against Jack if that's the case?
5372
Aw. ::::)
5372
I don't know. Even though I'm conflicted, it still feels like something I have to do.
5372
I admit, I'm pretty scared thinking a8out it.
5372
Not of him necessarily, 8ut of the fact that I apparently don't know myself as well as I 8elieved.
5372
What if I'm not as lucky as I thought?
5372
What if I do not in fact have ALLLLLLLL of the luck?
5372
Exactly!
5372
8ut then, if there is no chance of catching a 8ad 8r8k, then taking a risk doesn't even qualify as 8r8very, does it?
5372
It isn't even a risk, 8y definition!!!!!!!!
5372
So if this is going to mean anything, I guess I just have to find the strength from somewhere to go through with it.
5372
More than just the fakey strength that comes from turning a 8lind eye to all your flaws. You know what I mean?
5372
Hmm........
5373
You know how I said I couldn't rel8 to the attachment you have for your guardians?
5373
Well, I guess that isn't completely true.
5373
There are adult trolls who we can rel8 to, if we choose to, and if we are lucky enough to discover who they are.
5373
8ut it is not really in a familial sense, at least not socially speaking, the way you understand family. They are more like figures of legend, who are said to have more in common with us genetically than any other troll. 8ut we can never meet them of course. Only look up to them, and follow in their footsteps, 8ecause they died centuries ago.
5373
Yeah!
5373
We are each supposed to have one, and if you 8elieve the lore a8out it, your destiny will 8e tied to theirs. You will find clues pointing to them and who they were, 8ut you will only notice them if your eyes are open.
5373
You then can choose to take up the life they left for you. And if you do, they will always 8e looking out for you, and guide you in finishing what they started.
5373
I don't have to 8elieve.
5373
I am completely certain it is true, and I know who mine is!
5373
I have 8een doing my 8est to honor her legacy for most of my life.
5373
I even named my roleplaying character after her!
5373
She gained all the levels.
5373
AAAAAAAALL.
5373
OOOOOOOOF.
5373
THEEEEEEEEM!
5374
It was 8efore I ever started gaming, or rounding up other kids to feed my lusus.
5374
I was nearing the age where I would 8e expected to feed her.
5374
And she was starting to get so 8ig, that she would have to crawl out of the caverns soon, no longer a8le to feast on stray wigglers she caught in her we8.
5374
It was kind of an intense sym8iotic thing, a particularly demanding lusus-troll relationship, and only really strong kids are supposed to 8e a8le to handle it.
5374
So of course I was terrified of the responsi8ility looming!
5374
I really didn't think I would make it. I was sure I'd fail, and my lusus would either get angry and eat me, or she'd just die and then I'd 8e culled.
5374
8ut then I saw a shooting star one evening.
5374
I tracked down where it landed, and found a chest with my sign on it.
5374
A sign is an insignia we must wear, specific to our class. Each class has a huge alpha8et of signs, so when someone shares yours, you know you have a lot in common. I was so excited to see it.
5375
It was her journal!
5375
She documented all of her amazing adventures as she sailed around the world, commanding a notoriously deadly fleet of Gam8lignants.
5375
It was so thrilling reading it. It really felt like she wrote it just for me, like she was talking right to me and telling me how to 8e like her. She even left notes on where she 8uried treasure and stuff, which I followed l8er when I started RPing. I found her dice that way, and so many other gr8 things.
5375
Learning a8out her gave me the strength and confidence to do what I had to do.
5375
Yeah!!!!!!!!
5375
And that's not all.
5375
Not that I really needed it proved to me that she was my ancestor, 8ut that's exactly what happened while playing this game.
5375
It turned out that in addition to cre8ting us all in the ecto8iology la8, Karkat cre8ted our ancestors too!
5375
8ut he never 8elieved in any of that, and just thought they were random extra wigglers serving no purpose, the stu88orn jackass.
5375
The more common 8loods are less inclined to give a shit a8out that kind of stuff, legends and tradition and all that.
5375
Those in the upper classes like me put more stock in it, and rightly so.
5375
Oh yeah. Wow, I never thought a8out that.
5375
Hahahaha. That is an admira8le calling, John. Every 8it as dignified as the path of the Marquise!
5375
Yeah, that's so awesome!
5375
I agree.
5375
Haha, oh man...
5375
I was just thinking a8out your life on Earth.
5375
You had it so easy! You don't have to go hunting for clues a8out your ancestors at all.
5375
There was a picture of her hanging RIGHT THERE on the wall of your hive.
5375
Hahahahahahahaha!
5375
I don't know why, 8ut that is just so funny to me.
5375
Your lives are so simple and easy. It must 8e really nice 8eing a human, even though you're all so weak.
5375
8ut may8e it's ok to 8e weak, if that's what's normal.
5393
Go where?
5393
Are you sure you don't have more important things to worry a8out?
5393
John, please. I thought you were done getting the future spoon fed to you like this.
5393
I have told you that you will find your dad eventually. That should 8e good enough! Don't you think it's time to start taking your responsi8ility more seriously?
5393
We just concluded that I am going to go fight Jack. And there is a possi8ility I will fail! He could kill me easily for all I know. 8ut it's something I have to try.
5393
And if I do fail, your plan will serve as 8ackup. There is a lot riding on you, John. On 8oth of us!
5393
I'm not telling you to do anything. Just reminding you of what's at st8ke.
5393
Why don't we just call it what it is.
5393
A 8ig fucking 8om8 in the core of your 8attlefield.
5393
Yes, you could pro8a8ly go looking for a sanctioned entry point.
5393
Or you could just do what winners in a hurry do.
5393
Cheat!
5393
It's practically always possi8le.
5393
I won't tell you how, 8ut I will point out you could start making 8etter use of your powers than facilit8ing noisy joyrides.
5393
Is that what Earth is like, 8y the way? A 8unch of humans flying around in little wheeled pods constantly 8eeping at each other with their chauffeur familiars????????
5393
Anyway, I'm just saying it's time to do something useful and impressive with your powers, deli8er8ly for a change. You are a god now, remem8er?
5393
Use your imagin8tion!
5393
That windy thing of yours is more vers8tile than you think.
5394
Good.
5394
I think it's time for me to get going too. I will prepare for 8attle.
5394
What?
5394
Yeah! You got it. I will message you 8efore I leave.
5394
Of course.
5394
It will 8e a certainty.
5394
That said, there is no need for any sort of farewell right now.
5394
Go do your amazing windy thing, John. 8e cre8tive! I will talk to you l8er.
5594
John!!!!!!!!
5594
You're heading into the 8lackout, so I won't 8e a8le to see you until you leave.
5594
8ut don't worry, I can still sense you are there. 8ecause of awesome powers, remem8er?
5594
Smooth move, ditching your computer like that, 8y the way. That was some incredi8le leadership you showed!
5594
Now I have to contact you through Rose, thus exposing me to the risk of actually having to taaaaaaaalk to her........
5594
Your carelessness has put the Heroes of Light in a very awkward position, John. I hope you're satisfied.
5594
Hahahaha, just kidding. She's o8viously a little too "preoccupied" at the moment to 8e sassing me.
5594
Just 8orrow her computer and talk to me when you get the chance, ok?
5594
I will 8e w8ing. ::::)
5749
John!!!!!!!!
5749
You're heading into the 8lackout, so I won't 8e a8le to see you until you leave.
5749
8ut don't worry, I can still sense you are there. 8ecause of awesome powers, remem8er?

I will 8e waiting. ::::)
5750
........
5750
........x8
5750
........x8x8x8x8x8x8x8!!!!!!!!
5750
All of the dots, John. All 16.777216 million of them.
5750
Still dead, huh?
5750
Or are you too 8usy weeping over her corpse to pick up that headset and answer me????????
5750
You can't fool me, John. I know you are not staying dead for long.
5750
And it is not just 8ecause I can clearly see you're alive in the future! ::::P
5750
You see, we are 8oth the 8est there is, and therefore we have special privileges when it comes to mortality.
5750
It's hard to keep a god dead for good. We can only die under very specific circumstances. Didn't I mention?
5751
Nothing too glorious a8out the way you just died, I 8et.
5751
Let me guess, even after all my lessons, you allowed yourself to get sucker sta88ed, right? Pretty lame!
5751
I mean, lucky for you it was lame. I guess 8eing lame pays off when dying a hero's what gets you killed.
5751
If our Hero of 8reath reached god tier, he would have 8een completely indestructi8le! Lol.
5751
Damn, I forgot, I was going to stop ripping on that guy, since he got sta88ed through the chest and died. Haha, whoops.
5751
Anyway, I figure you're pro8a8ly safe from a just death too, since I'm pretty sure you haven't done anything all that despica8le.
5751
Yet. ::::)
5752
I don't know for sure, 8ut I'm 8etting that if I go to fight Jack, it will wipe out all the 8ad things I've done.
5752
I think if I die it'll 8e a hero's death, so it ought to stick.
5752
Pretty good motiv8tion to win the fight though, don't you think?
5752
One way or another, I think this will 8e my last 8ig challenge as a gamer.
5752
As such, I would like to pass my dice on to you.
5752
It is very important to me that they stay in good hands, John. That you continue their legacy, and that of my ancestor.
5752
82THE8TH
5752
Use the code! I'm sure I can count on you to make something awesome with it.
5753
Still not alive yet? Man.
5753
You 8etter hurry up! She pro8a8ly doesn't have much time left.
5753
Trust me, what she's going through on Derse right now isn't much fun.
5753
Ok, I guess I should mention why I'm trying to contact you now of all times, rather than just skipping ahead.
5753
Remem8er how we talked a8out your 8ackup plan? The one you have devised to defeat Jack, in the off chance I fail?
5753
Well, it's not going to work if Rose is dead, is it?
5753
You have to wake her up! 8reathe some life into her. Do the windy thing, with your lips!!!!!!!!
5753
You know what that means........
5754
Gotta kiss her.
5754
Don't worry, I still can't see you, so there is no reason to 8e 8ashful or anything.
5754
And since we are a couple of professionals here who are focused on winning, we 8oth know it doesn't have any meaning.
5754
It's not l8ke I would 8e jealous even if I could see.
5754
Why wo8ld I 8e?
5754
Or may8e that didn't even cr8ss your mind........ haha.
5754
M8n, why am I ev8n t8lking a8out th8s.
5755
Let's just forget I said that. This isn't really how I wanted this convers8tion to go!
5755
I guess I was assuming you'd 8e talking 8ack 8y now. So now I'm just talking and talking and spinning my wheel device like an idiot.
5755
May8e I don't actually know how I wanted it to go.
5755
I guess I could just shut up and skip ahead on your timeline a little, talk to you when you're alive.
5755
That would make sense.
5755
So
5755
I guess
5755
I will do that.
5755
8ut then........
5755
May8e if I did, I wouldn't actually say what I wanted to say.
5755
So
5755
I will just say it.
5756
To 8e honest, I am nervous a8out this fight.
5756
8ut I'm still going through with it, for a lot of reasons.
5756
To save my friends, or at least the ones who are still alive. Oh, and I guess to save reality itself from 8eing totally fucked up. There's that too.
5756
8ut I think what's motiv8ting me to win this fight the most is........
5756
The possi8ility of getting to meet you when it's all over!
5756
May8e I can finally put all this terri8le stuff 8ehind me.
5756
And I won't have to worry a8out 8eing the 8est anymore, or proving what a ruthless killer I can 8e.
5756
May8e I can try out whatever is supposed to 8e normal for a human. Who knows, it might not 8e as 8oring as it sounds!
5756
May8e
5756
If you're not too freaked out 8y all the 8ad things I've done........
5756
Or the fact that I am an alien
5756
We could go on a d8? ::::O
5757
Don't worry, it could 8e a human d8, whatever that entails.
5757
No weird alien stuff, I promise! And no killing or murders, or even talking a8out killing or murders and such. Just whatever you like to talk a8out and think is cool.
5757
I could even 8e persu8ed to watch more of your a8surd human films.
5757
Do you like any others which feature that rugged human with the long hair and wounded arm?
5757
You know the one. The sweaty guy with the mutil8ed animal and the speech impediment.
5757
Those would 8e tolera8le to watch, I 8et.
5758
Well, think it over.
5758
8efore I go, I'll get in touch one more time l8er on, when you're alive and may8e have something to say a8out it.
5758
Oh yeah........
5758
Sorry a8out your adult male guardian. I wasn't trying to 8e deceptive 8y not telling you.
5758
I decided not to, 8ecause I didn't want to 8e the one to make you sad a8out it.
5758
Was that selfish of me? I dunno.
5758
You would have found out regardless. Like we all did. There are things we care a8out that we just have to leave 8ehind.
5758
It just sucks for those who aren't in as much a hurry to leave it all 8ehind as me!
5758
W8.
5758
Someone's coming, hang on.
5759
Oh god.
5759
She's wearing her RP outfit! What the hell is she up to?
5759
Man, she's got her dum8 dragon doll and everything. Guess she means 8usiness this time.
5759
Dammit, I've got to go deal with this now.
5759
Anyway, if you actually get around to reading any of this, thanks for listening, John.
5759
If my outrageously gr8 luck has any say in the matter, we will 8e meeting up in no time!
5759
Just please consider what I said.
5759
Ok........
5759
L8r! <33333333
5764
OH GOD.
5764
OH MY FUCKING HELL, THIS IS SO INSANELY AWKWARD AND SAD.
5764
HANG ON
5781
Hi, John human.
5782
Yes, I can see that. Two ugly garments, and seeds for some kind of strange earth vegeta8le? Pretty lame present, John!!!!!!!!
5782
Not as awesome as something you will 8e wearing later, thanks to me.
5782
Calm down, I just thought I would foreshadow my existence to you at this quaint moment on your timeline.
5782
It is way too tempting not to let you know I have taken gr8 care to 8ecome a very important feature of your life.
5782
Or for that matter, to let you know that I will 8e giving you a present so much 8etter than the useless crap you're shoving in that 8ox.
5782
I will 8e giving you the gift of immortality!
5782
Yes, as a matter of fact. Nice guess!
5782
It will come at a cost though.
5782
The latter, jackass!
5782
In order for you to claim it, you will have to 8e quite gulli8le and allow me to arrange your murder.
5782
8ut you will 8e! You will happily go along with everything I tell you to do.
5782
And then, once I have completely earned your trust, I will kill you John. ::::)
5782
8ut this is all true. I've seen it already. You have no idea how delicious the dramatic irony is right now!
5782
You will die. I will lead you into a trap, and watch you 8leed to death on a 8ig stone sla8 with a sword stuck in your chest.
5782
There is nothing you can do a8out it. In fact, it has already happened!
5782
I'll leave you alone soon enough.
5782
I was just feeling pretty pleased with myself, a8out all the 8rilliant plans I made for you and your friends.
5782
Stopping 8y in your past to mess with your head is really just a courtesy, 8ecause I like to think we're pretty good friends 8y the time I get around to killing you. ::::D
5782
I guess so.
5782
8ut my inevita8le grisly murder of you notwithstanding, you're a pretty fun guy to hassle. It'll 8e difficult sparing you from the privilege of my company until your game 8egins.
5782
Please, John. As if there is any conceiva8le sequence of events which could lead me to consider you as a via8le romantic partner, in any quadrant. Even the pale ones.
5782
Yes.
5782
I mean, I was going to.
5782
8ut now I guess I'm not.
5782
8ecause this isn't really happening.
5782
It did, once.
5782
8ut now it's just a memory.
5782
I guess I must 8e dead.
5783
The conversation as it went 8efore is already over. I said good8ye, and you 8locked me. Don't you remem8er?
5783
Exactly. 8ecause we've already 8een through this. You're either asleep, or dead like me.
5783
Man! I can't 8elieve I let her trick me like that. Such an amateur mistake.
5783
Hey........
5783
Do you have any recollection at all of the last message I sent you 8efore I died?
5783
Yeah, I figured. Just as well. I made some pretty em8arrassing confessions to you.
5783
I guess I'm getting what I asked for in a way. Even though it's not what I pictured.
5783
I asked you if you wanted to........
5783
You know.
5783
Hang out.
5783
Yes.
5783
So what do you say?
5783
Or, what do you think you might have said?
5783
Yeah.
5783
John, there is no present! You are not in your hive, and you don't have anything to send. She received it a long time ago. None of this matters anymore.
5783
If you don't 8elieve me, you are free to look out your window.
5783
It might help you remem8er.
5783
And........
5783
You will 8e a8le to see me.
5783
If you want.
5805
Yes, John. Horns and all. That totally proves I am an alien 8eyond a shadow of a dou8t!
5805
Now what do you make of these 8lank white eyes of mine? What do you think THAT could mean, hmmmmmmmm?
5805
Humans have literally the dum8est extraterrestrial lore. Weren't those supposed to 8e aliens on one of your posters?
5805
Well if you want to know, normally, we have 8right orange eyes, with gray irises. They fill in with our 8lood pigment as we get older.
5805
Also, normally I have this one goofy eye with seven pupils 8ecause I'm kind of a weirdo. 8ut I guess that's gone now that I'm dead.
5805
Not that you 8elieve me, 8ecause you just refuse to remem8er anything.
5805
So you don't remem8er anything a8out the game at all, then? The destruction of your planet? 8ringing your ancestor 8ack to life as a clown woman?
5805
Putting a huge flaming ocean out with your magical wind? Jack Noir? Dying, resurrecting, and possi8ly dying again? Is any of this tickling your sponge?
5805
Fuck, I cannot 8elieeeeeeeeve how cold it is on this planet. How can any species possi8ly 8e a8le to survive somewhere like this?
5806
Oh.
5806
Ok.
5806
Sure, John. Let's just say that's what it was.
5806
Thanks.
5806
So, is this how humans 8egin an earth d8?
5806
With simple acts of flattery and kindness?
5806
No. I've decided this definitely will not 8e a d8.
5806
Not until you remem8er something, at least.
5806
Now that you mention it, me too, pro8a8ly. Your goofy awkwardness is a 8it contagious, frankly.
5806
So now what do we do?
5807
Hey........
5807
This thing isn't slimy at all! What the hell.
5807
I've noticed humans don't seem to keep any slime around the hive. And yet you are strangely cavalier a8out your open display of certain........ receptacles.
5807
What's the deal with that? Is it that you're just that ashamed of your secretions as a species?
5807
So 8izarre.
5807
Sure.
5807
My custodian had her ways of making me tougher too.
5807
That's fine.
5807
What else can you show me?
5807
Sounds gr8.
5808
Does your planet usually have these kind of temper8ture swings?
5808
No thanks. I think I'll keep it on.
5809
I know what happened.
5809
I saw it.
5809
Yes.
5809
Do you want to know?
5809
It might jostle your memory.
5809
I 8elieve this lake is where Jade landed. You landed a little ways over there, a8out where your hive is now. You clo88ered your nanna to death with the aforementioned joke 8ook. 8ut it wasn't your fault. You were 8oth just little wigglers, riding meteors from the future.
5809
You cre8ted yourself, your nanna, Jade, her grandpa, not to mention Dave and Rose and their guardians, all in a la8 using paradox slime, and sent them 8ack in time as the silly gru8s with arms and legs you call 8a8ies. And here you were dou8ting the usefulness of slime!
5809
Yes, a8solutely.
5809
I paid close attention to all this, 8ecause I thought it might give me some clues a8out us and our ancestors, who were made the same way.
5809
Any of this familiar?
5809
Yeah. I figured as much.
5809
Since you seem 8ent on staying in your dream 8u88le coma, why don't I continue the tour?
5809
Sort of.
5810
We are going on an adventure.
5810
Through your memories.
5810
Through mine too.
5810
This would 8e a really fun thing to do on a d8, I think!
5810
If we actually were on a d8, which we're not.
5811
If that's what you want to think to keep you comfy in your stupor, sure.
5811
This is my home planet 8efore it was destroyed.
5811
It's called Alternia.
5811
That is my hive, which is a thing that you refer to as a house.
5811
It's where I grew up.
5812
No shit!
5812
It is 8ig and fore8oding and ostent8ious, just the way I wanted it.
5812
As a 8lue8lood, I was entitled to 8uild such a home. Something to set me far apart from the commoners.
5812
Of course not. Ro8ots 8uilt it for me when I was very young.
5812
8ut I was allowed to dict8 instructions. Expected to, in fact.
5812
Really?
5812
I still find it interesting what sort of mundane facts humans tend to 8e impressed 8y.
5812
Anyway, my design kind of got 8oring as I got older. A huge castle hive sounds great, 8ut it starts feeling pretty cavernous and lonely after a while. There were so many 8locks I never even used!
5812
Your tastes change, 8ut you get stuck with growing up in a place suited to your earliest, most juvenile inclin8ions.
5812
No8ody tells you that when you're a kid though.
5812
John........
5812
That 8arely compara8le example is so cute, I don't even know what to say.
5813
This was my custodian.
5814
She was hurt in an accident.
5814
I killed her myself to put her out of her misery.
5815
Yeah. I was really into treasure hunting for a while.
5815
Never mind those!
5816
This was my respite8lock.
5816
From kind of an em8arrassing memory, actually.
5816
John, addiction is a powerful thing. You pro8a8ly wouldn't understand.
5816
Just a fairy dress.
5816
I wore it for this stupid thing I did once.
5816
Don't worry a8out it! Man, this would 8e such an awkward moment on a d8. Again, if it was one.
5816
Let's keep going.
5817
You tell me.
5817
I don't know, John. They're your memories.
5818
Shrug!!!!!!!!
5818
It was your 13th.
5819
Sounds like some things are coming 8ack to you.
5819
Any chance you remem8er me yet?
5823
........
5824
Well, just so you know, he is pro8a8ly not actually there.
5824
Kind of like how my lusus was just a memory.
5824
As a matter of fact, yes, I am a psychic alien. 8ut that has nothing to do with this!
5824
These are our memories, and we are in the afterlife. I keep trying to tell you, and it's starting to get frustr8ing.
5824
Aaaaaaaargh!
5824
Does that mean you'll 8elieve me now?
5824
It's nice that you 8elieve me. 8ut that doesn't mean you remem8er yet.
5824
He died too. You saw his 8ody. Don't you at least remem8er that?
5824
Then what?
5824
Do you remem8er me yet?
5824
This comes as news to me.
5824
You do?
5849
This sounds like Terezi's handiwork.
5849
Yep. That's her.
5849
I guess she got 8oth of us then. Un8elieva8le.
5849
Yes.
5849
Well, not tricked, so much as made a pointless coin flip and sta88ed me in the 8ack.
5849
Oh, sure. She was easily the most underhanded and villainous mem8er of our group.
5849
8ut I did let my guard down. And even when she sta88ed me, I sure didn't think I was going to die.
5849
It turns out immortality isn't all it's cracked up to 8e. Let's leave it at that.
5849
No, I did! 8ut........
5849
Ugh, this will 8e hard to explain to you.
5849
Haha. I guess in her own sick way, she actually set us up on this d8 together.
5849
May8e I should thank her whenever she falls asleep? Or dies, god for8id.
5849
I don't know.
5849
I said it wouldn't 8e unless you remem8ered. And now you remem8er.
5849
8ut you still don't remem8er me, do you?
5849
Yeah, thought so.
5849
This version of you died 8efore I started messing with you. Not that I expect you to understand what that means.
5849
Yes, that's right.
5849
I guess I should have learned to give you more credit 8y now.
5849
I still can't 8elieve I'm meeting a version of you that doesn't remem8er a thing a8out me. None of my gr8 exploits, or any of the ways I helped you. Only that one stupid time I taunted you!
5849
It's a vaguely frustr8ing feeling.
5849
So you remem8er literally nothing I told you a8out myself? Not even the, uh........
5849
Compromising stuff?
5849
Your species would think so. 8ut I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
5849
You wouldn't find that 8oring?
5849
I haven't?
5849
........
5849
It's Vriska.
5849
Yes.
5849
Man, I don't know.
5849
May8e,
5849
You could tell me a8out how you died?
5849
What were the "things that just happened" you were talking a8out?
5850
::::D
5851
Not really.
5851
I'm used to taking shortcuts whenever I play games.
5851
*Snort.*
5851
Against a denizen? Of course that piece of shit isn't going to do anything.
5851
If I were you, I would have chucked it into the forge.
5851
It might 8e alright if you com8ined it with something awesome.
5851
Like some cool dice, for instance.
5852
What's this?
5852
You were right to 8e nervous. Denizens are incredi8ly powerful monsters. You had no chance whatsoever at this stage of the game.
5852
You might have stood a chance after I started helping you. 8ut Terezi really screwed you over 8y leading you here so early.
5852
Why?
5852
What was? Getting killed 8y a monster?
5852
How could you know all that?
5853
This denizen does not look asleep to me.
5853
Well, that explains your quick death. If your denizen was anything like mine, it wouldn't have wasted much time 8efore unleashing a huge shitstorm of devast8ing monster magic.
5853
Her name was Cetus.
5853
She was this awful sea monster. Her lair was deep underground amidst a 8unch of shipwrecks. She was quite vicious and territorial. I knew I had to kill her quickly to release the hoard, 8efore she had the chance to do anything tricky.
5853
Oh, of course. She was 8a88ling in riddles through most of the fight. I wasn't paying much attention though. I mean, what creature DOESN'T speak in 8oring riddles in this game?
5853
Yeah, pretty much. We were all pretty good players, remem8er?
5853
Well........
5853
Ok, I can't exactly speak for everyone. There was a lot going on, and I don't know how some people went a8out 8eating their denizens.
5853
For instance, I'm not sure how our hero of 8reath did it. May8e the monster just released the hoard for him out of pity????????
5853
If there was a way to avoid a tough 8attle, I'm sure he found it.
5853
It sounds like a good way to cheat yourself out of a lot of sweet xp and loot though.
5853
John, are you saying you had a nice friendly chat with this hideous, 8loodthirsty creature 8efore he killed you?
6667
Hahahahahahahaha!
6667
Aaaaaaaa haaaaaaaa haaaaaaaa haaaaaaaa haaa........ man, fuck this.
6667
It's a real pain in the ass typing out long victorious laughs with only one hand, you know?
6667
Gonna have to patch this thing up somehow. May8e I'll pay a visit to my neigh8or a little l8er.
6667
Getting my arm fixed nearly ought to 8e worth enduring the stench. Aw yeah. Sick 8urn from outta nowhere. Take that, Zahhak.
6667
Haha! NEIGH8or. I can't 8elieve I only thought of that now! I 8et he'll get kick out of that.
6667
I 8et you even more he won't laugh though. What a 8oring piece of shit.
6667
I know YOU would think it's funny though. Right Terezi?
6667
Man, I sure am glad this little feud of ours is 8asically over. We're totally even!
6667
Now we can just go 8ack to 8eing friends, and things will 8e gr8.
6667
Hmmmmmmmm........
6667
Hahahaha! You won't 8elieve this, 8ut it only occurred to me now that you won't even 8e a8le to read this!
6667
Even if you do somehow manage to stum8le 8ack to your hive........ you're 8lind now! Whoooooooops.
6667
It would 8e a real shame if we couldn't 8ury the hatchet and 8e gr8 friends again 8ecause of a stupid 8ullshit reason like that.
6668
Oh, I know.
6668
May8e I'll mindjack some random chump and send him to your hive so he can read my messages to you out loud!
6668
What a perfect solution. He can 8e your assisted living slave.
6668
I would have had the perfect candid8 all lined up, 8ut he recently lost the use of his legs unfortun8ly. Oh well, I'll just roll with the punches like I always do and find someone else.
6668
Just say the word, and I'll make him do whatever you want! Read my awesome notes to you, hang some more plush dragons from your tree, pre-chew your food........
6668
Well, may8e not pre-chew it, since I didn't exactly knock your teeth out, did I?
6668
May8e more like pre-look-at your food, to make sure there are 8ugs in it.
6668
See, isn't it gr8 when we're helping each other out instead of maiming each other repeatedly?
6668
This is how it should 8e 8etween Scourge Sisters. All the maimings and 8acksta88ings should 8e saved for the friends and foes who get in our way, don't you think?
6668
Hey, what do you want to do for our next campaign, 8tw?
6668
We can take the next one easy. I'll try to think of something 8etter suited to your new disa8ility!
6668
I mean, I've ALREADY pretty much nixed anything involving stairs, 8ecause of Tavros. Lol.
6668
8n't no one can say I'm not willing to meet people half way!!!!!!!!
6668
Whew........
6668
I'm losing a lot of 8lood here.
6668
Good thing I seem to have a ton of the stuff. We high8loods are made of some pretty tough shit.
6668
What a fucking mess, though. Not really looking forward to cleaning this up.
6668
I've got to say, your prank was pretty good. Still not sure how you pulled it off. Pretty inconvenient though!
6668
It's too 8ad you're not going to get to read this for a while, if ever. We could 8e 8onding over the gr8 pranks we just pulled on each other!
6668
Oh well.
6668
Guess I'll take off. 8efore I drop dead like some kind of loser and you never get to hear from me again.
6668
See you around, sis.
6668
Hey now!
6668
What kind of attitude is that to 8ring into this memory?
6668
Easy, there.
6668
No need to waste good remorse on such a trivial exchange.
6668
I am only reminding you,
6668
That if you 8ring too much 8aggage from the past into the memory, it is dou8tful your experience will 8e either therapeutic or cathartic.
6668
You were the one who invoked this memory after all.
6668
Isn't this why you are here? Is it not what you have 8een hoping for and fretting you may find since your journey 8egan?
6668
A chance to say you are sorry?
6668
Sorry for the ruse.
6668
Though it isn't as far from the truth as it possi8ly could 8e, I am not who you think I am.
6668
I of course needed to visit you through a memory, and interestingly, this is the one you gave me.
6668
No ill will or upsetting hijinks were intended.
6669
Aranea.
6669
And I am your friend's ancestor.
6669
In fact, I am yours too, in a way.
6669
Yes. Though not quite how you are picturing.
6669
She had an ancestor whom she was aware of, and technically that is who I am.
6669
That is to say, she is who I would have 8ecome on your world, had I arrived in her place. Alas, I did not.
6669
She was a figure in your history who preceded you 8y thousands of solar sweeps.
6669
Whereas I preceded your entire civilization 8y 8illions.
6670
That's ok. There is plenty of time to sort it all out.
6670
I've 8een keeping an eye on you all for quite a while. Your whole planet, actually. It was very interesting this time around, to say the least.
6670
It even had a different name! "Alternia." Haha. How heavy handed can you get?
6670
The man responsi8le was a 8it of a wise guy. He rewrote everything. He had a knack for overzealous storytelling, which is a harmless enough ha8it usually. I'm guilty of it myself sometimes.
6670
8ut it is not so harmless when the perpetrator is omniscient and omnipotent.
6670
That's right.
6670
8ut he's dead now, and his story is over. The 8ook on our universe is closed, 8oth for my instance and yours.
6670
This 8eing the case, I thought it was the right time to introduce myself. The com8ined work of my group and yours is unfinished, and the outcome has not 8een assured.
6670
The true ultimate reward has yet to 8e achieved. No safe haven has 8een created that is free from the devastation caused 8y Mr. Milkshake's grand deception.
6670
Our race still teeters on extinction. The mem8ers of your party, and one noteworthy fugitive, are the sole survivors.
6670
We must work together to create that haven and restore our race, so that the sacrifices we all made will not 8e in vain.
6670
8ut in order to repair the unthinka8le damage that has 8een done, we need to allow ourselves the chance to heal first.
6670
Old wounds, old regrets. They will serve no purpose on the rest of your journey.
6670
Sure. You have to start somewhere.
6670
Not at the moment.
6670
8ut the more time you spend here, the more likely it is you will find whomever you are looking for.
6670
On the other hand, if it is the unknowa8le will of the gods, you may dance around each other indefinitely as you pass through this space. It is hard to say.
6670
Well, if she had 8een dwelling in this 8u88le like you thought, what would you want to say to her?
6670
Surely you would not have just argued a8out the past.
6670
Then what would you say to me?
6671
No. I can empathize.
6671
She was a serious trou8lemaker in your party. Many player groups have to deal with those.
6671
I feel as though we had one of the worst cases in our party. 8ut when all was said and done, she was still our friend.
6671
At that moment, perhaps.
6671
You know very well the channels of possi8ility at that exact juncture resulted from her decision paths as well as yours.
6671
8ut even so, when it comes to your key decisions, the possi8ilities are pro8a8ly fewer and more discrete than you have presumed.
6671
Otherwise you would not see results consolidated into those vortices, would you? Possi8ility would resem8le an enormous hazy field of infinitely su8tle variations and micro-choices.
6671
Imagine if at that moment you truly were capa8le of anything, no matter how outlandish, a8surd, or patently fruitless. How would this vast amount of information present itself to you through your senses? What difference would it make in your final decision if all other tri8utaries of whim spilled into the same decaying future? And what would this make of your agency as a hero meant to learn and grow?
6671
Look at it this way. Imagine that over the course of someone's life, they are truly capa8le of every conceiva8le action at any moment, and did indeed take each of those actions in different 8ranching realities. Doesn't a scenario like that deaden a person's agency just as much as one where their fate is decidedly etched in stone as a single path of unavoida8le decisions? Who exactly is that person who can and does take all conceiva8le actions, other than someone perfectly generic, who only appears to have unique predilections and motives when you examine the ar8itrary path they happen to occupy?
6671
Pardon the esoteric tangent. These are my instincts as a Hero of Light kicking in. It's hard for us to resist prattling on a8out matters like this.
6671
::::)
6671
You may seek to understand your decisions and look for justice in their consequences. You may wonder why honora8le choices from the innocent are punished 8y 8anishment to a timeline in which everyone dies and all is gradually dissolved.
6671
It helps to understand your role, not just as a hero who must overcome, 8ut as a single capillary within a much larger 8ioexistential system.
6671
Think of it like circulatory system, where the veins and capillaries that do not help the overall flow of 8lood through the system are likely to wither and die. Those are doomed offshoots.
6671
Reality itself is using you and many others to propagate its own existence. Strictly speaking, there is only one path to its successful propagation. 8ut it still permits you to make choices. Not all that are conceiva8le, 8ut some nevertheless, as dictated 8y who you are and the challenges you face. And you are free to make key decisions however you like, as long as you understand that some of these paths unfairly or not will lead to o8livion. 8ecause those choices do not contri8ute constructively to the perpetuation of all existence, including your own.
6671
Such is the 8urden assumed 8y anyone who plays this game.
6672
Well, you aren't finished 8eing one, are you?
6672
Which one would you tell it to?
6672
The one who fought with Noir, or the one who didn't?
6673
Ah.
6673
Well, this could either 8e my experience as an ancient ghost talking, or the perspective I am naturally given to as a Light player,
6673
8ut aren't you equally responsi8le for 8oth?
6673
I can see why you would feel more responsi8ility for one than the other.
6673
My perspective is informed 8y my class and aspect. It was to my advantage as a healer to see things a little differently. To find equanimity across many different outcomes.
6673
There's more to the realization of our roles than gaining flashy powers.
6673
And there's more to healing than repairing 8attle damage.
6673
You killed a friend and you understanda8ly feel regret.
6673
8ut it's done. She is gone and you are still here.
6673
Now what?
6674
You could look for a8solution through rationalization. Everyone would have died if you didn't take action, so why trou8le yourself with guilty emotion?
6674
8ut there is no real healing power in 8elieving that. And I don't think it's what you wanted to tell yourself anyway, is it?
6674
Or what a8out through renunciation of responsi8ility? If you were just a tool used 8y reality to perpetuate itself, where is the 8lame?
6674
8ut that would 8e another empty idea that has no power to heal.
6674
You've 8een lead to 8elieve such acts of violence are natural for your kind, and that if you're upset 8y the consequences then something is wrong with you.
6674
8ut it isn't as natural as you might think. That conditioning was a part of Milkshake's long con.
6674
Violence was respected and cele8rated on your world, 8ut remorse was rarely felt and pain could never heal due to such empty justifications. We died out a wounded race, and you are all that's left.
6674
The process of healing first involves sifting through what it isn't, which happens to 8e almost everything your trou8led mind has to offer.
6674
There isn't one.
6675
It takes time, and is only accelerated 8y looking at things honestly.
6675
This is what I did as a Sylph of Light. Helped people see things.
6675
I could even perform the feat literally, if you wanted.
6675
It's up to you of course.
6676
Not at all. That's a very good reason.
6676
I thought the polite thing to do was at least offer.
6677
Yes. 8ut in a different universe instance, I often refer to as A1. The shorthand helps avoid confusion, trust me.
6677
My group of twelve played the game, 8ut failed. It overwhelmed us. A lot went wrong. The reckoning destroyed our 8attlefield well 8efore we had any hope of winning.
6677
I sought advice from Echidna, and she told me how to scratch the session to give us another chance.
6677
8ut the choice to do so came with accepting the annihilation of our existing forms. In the new instance, we would lead completely different lives with no memory of what happened.
6677
So we did, and created A2. Your instance, your world, and your game in which we were all inexplica8ly created in the first place.
6677
As I said, this time around the world was........ interesting.
6677
Not all of you.
6677
Some had lessons from the old world to teach others. 8ut few ever heard them.
6677
Not exactly. 8ut life was pretty mild and uneventful.
6677
I'm not even sure if I was especially nice, 8y our standards.
6677
Mostly kind of 8oring.
6677
No8ody from my party liked me a whole lot.
6677
I think I talked too much, and had a ha8it of 8ringing conversations 8ack around to myself.
6677
Not that it matters anymore, 8ut it was not the 8est way to make friends.
6677
Thanks!
6677
It goes to show, just 8ecause your race is peaceful doesn't mean you don't have pro8lems.
6677
I used to fantasize a8out 8eing someone really outgoing and dramatic.
6677
Someone who had the confidence do whatever she wanted, like go on the most outrageous adventures without caring what anyone thought a8out her.
6677
Like someone from a 8ook, you know?
6677
It turned out I actually got what I wanted after the reset. Unfortunately it came along with our people's enslavement and near extinction.
6677
Not that I really got to live as her, exactly. 8ut at least I got a chance to follow her life. And it was a very long life.
6677
8eing here for ages has its 8enefits.
6678
It has 8een a very long time.
6678
So long, time has 8een stripped of the meaning it never really had in the first place.
6678
It doesn't really pass in the same way it does when you're alive. Concepts like "now" and "how long" are figures of speech used to make communication simpler.
6678
I've quit trying to give expression to the elusive temporal properties of this place. It's easier staying conversational.
6678
8ut I will say that 8eing here "for so long" lends itself to a certain detachment from what you see. Otherwise, monitoring the atrocities stemming from our failure wouldn't 8e much fun.
6678
Yes, sometimes.
6678
8ut missing it usually invites memories of home to serve as the stage.
6678
Not that it's a su8stitute for the previous reality. 8ut the reminders of home are everywhere.
6678
Yes. I see them often enough.
6678
Except for one, whom I haven't seen at all since 8efore we all died.
6678
In fact, she's the only reason we are here in the first place, as opposed to merely ceasing to exist upon the scratch.
6678
In life, she was the only one I would have called a close friend, in a way.
6678
The thing is, no8ody liked her much either. We had that in common. ::::)
6678
Remem8er how I said the gods could keep you dancing around someone you're looking for indefinitely?
6678
Well, "8illions," yes. In a manner of speaking.
6678
That's right. In fact, we are on our way to visit her now.
6678
Notice the moon up there?
6678
And not the larger green interloper. That one never 8elonged to my world. It is your memory, not mine.
6678
It's the setting of the memory she entered.
6678
From her perspective, she has just arrived here.
6678
Your friends should 8e joining us too, 8efore your meteor clears the 8u88le.
6678
May8e together we can 8ring the Thief of Life up to speed.
6739
Tavros, this fucking sucks.
6739
What do you mean, "wHAT,"?
6739
For starters, that completely horri8le shared 8ody resurrection 8ullshit that just happened.
6739
You were there, remem8er? That's kind of the point!
6739
Overreacting my ass!
6739
What a nightmare. It's still making my ghostly skin crawl just thinking a8out it.
6739
Oh, sure. That's easy for you to say.
6739
You weren't the one getting the short end of the shared personality stick!
6739
May8e if your personality was as much an upgrade to mine as mine was to yours, I would have 8een cool with it too.
6739
What?
6739
Hahahaha. You're welcome!
6739
Now that you mention it, may8e there was a silver lining to that freak show.
6739
Someone else finally got a chance to feel first hand how gr8 it is 8eing me!
6739
Ok. Dead mostly.
6739
Yeah.
6739
Hey, sorry a8out that 8y the way.
6739
A8out killing you! It wasn't very cool of me.
6739
How could you forget? Haven't you 8een pissed off at me a8out it?
6739
No, you idiot! That's not what happened at all. I sta88ed you through the chest 8ecause I was 8eing a huge 8itch!
6739
Ugh, stop 8eing so stupid. That's so stupid!
6739
You are such a pain in the ass when you're dead. Let's just agree it was my fault and drop it.
6739
Man, 8eing dead is such a drag.
6739
I don't know if I can deal with this shit anymore!
6739
Oh come on. It's so 8oring!
6739
What a completely pointless and hollow existence this is.
6739
And if the existential malaise wasn't 8ad enough, now I have to 8e constantly watching out for that fucking orange guy.
6739
The orange guy! Haven't you seen him?
6740
Well, there's an orange guy.
6740
No, not Davesprite! It's just some random pointless orange guy who's 8een hassling me for some reason.
6740
I can't catch a 8r8k!
6740
And if that weren't enough of a nuisance, we've apparently got to deal with getting yanked out of the afterlife without a moment's notice 8y some 8ozo in a codpiece to particip8 in his grotesque 8ody fusion pranks.
6740
8etween you and me, I'm starting to think we are getting jerked around here. You know?
6740
Some inexplica8le forces out there are fucking with us. They are doing everything in their power to make sure that when we're not 8eing totally humili8ted, we are staying completely irrelevant.
6740
We can't let them toy with us, then just sweep us under the carpet like that. I'm not going to let our relevance 8e marginalized anymore, Tavros.
6740
I think it's time to start fucking some shit up.
6740
More like oh yes!
6740
I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of 8eing dead and useless and 8ored, and I'm not going to take it anymore.
6740
You're with me, right?
6740
Tavros, that is the lamest thing I've ever heard you say, which is really saying something.
6740
You've got to quit that loser attitude and get your ass out of the sand. That's just your low self esteem talking again.
6740
I'm going to have to insist.
6740
You are going to join me and together we are going to fuck shit up.
6740
Yes, you are.
6740
Yes.
6740
Yes.
6740
::::D
7285
TAAAAAAAAVR........ Oh!
7285
Hi John.
7285
Tavros, I didn't know you were hanging out with John. You should have come told me.
7285
What? What were you arguing a8out?
7285
W8........ what do you mean woke up? Why were you asleep?
7285
Dammit, Tavros. You can't 8e slacking off like that.
7285
I told you, we aren't fucking around anymore. This is serious 8usiness.
7286
Yeah!
7286
Oh, sorry. I really should have introduced myself. I guess I forgot I technically never met this version of you.
7286
Yep.
7286
Yes, John. That's what 8eing a ghost means.
7286
No, I get what you're asking.
7286
Yes, the real me. The actual, legit, fully authentic alpha timeline Vriska. Dead. Gone. Fuckin' toast.
7286
A corpse!!!!!!!!
7286
That's assuming my 8ody was sufficiently preserved during the trip.
7286
Which, now that I think a8out it, I guess it was? It must have 8een, 8ecause otherwise that unspeaka8le prototyping atrocity couldn't have happened.
7286
That piece of shit clown. I still have no idea what the deal with that was! He's completely lost his mind. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
7286
Honestly, I'm surprised you hadn't already heard I was dead, one way or another. It's kind of old news?
7286
Then again, these things are all relative. So who knows.
7286
Are you ok? You seem sad.
7286
I guess so.
7286
Oh yeah! That's right. We were.
7286
8ut then I got sta88ed through the 8ack. Which to 8e fair, was for the good of the party, so the meteor could make the trip in the first place, and keep this whole crazy sequence of events intact.
7286
Not gonna lie. I made some mistakes.
7286
Just some pointless, deadly teen drama. Mostly 8rought on 8y ourselves, all acting like juvenile idiots. Like I said, old news.
7286
VERY old for me. I've 8een here a pretty long time now.
7286
A lot has happened since I died. John, did you know the little rendezvous we planned sort of already happened? I mean, in a way.
7286
Yes. With your ghost.
7286
I mean, the ghost of one of your altern8te selves, who died along the way doing some stupid thing.
7286
Actually, he and I d8ted for a little while.
7286
Groan. Here we go.
7286
Tavros, I have led a rich and complic8ted life and death. I can hardly 8e expected to tell you a8out every little thing that I've 8een through.
7286
8esides, you should have already known this a8out me.
7286
8ecause we shared a sprite 8ody once!!!!!!!! We 8riefly had access to all each others memories and feelings.
7286
So if you didn't take the chance to dig that out of my memory, you only have yourself to 8lame.
7286
Well, all I can say is, I managed! I took the opportunity to remem8er pretty much all YOUR memories.
7286
I was in and out like a 8andit, and now all your life experiences are mine.
7286
Them's the 8r8ks!!!!!!!!
7287
Yes.
7287
What?
7287
Why?
7287
Hey, we apparently don't get to remem8er the results of a lot of choices we didn't actually make!
7287
Again, see: the 8r8ks.
7287
It was fine. For a while.
7287
It didn't really work out.
7287
We crossed paths every now and then after that.
7287
Things stayed pretty friendly 8etween us.
7287
Until he died.
7287
He was murdered.
7287
Yes.
7287
Yes! Dead dead. For good.
7287
Jack? Are you kidding? No, John.
7287
Jack is 8arely in the picture as a threat anymore. He's just more old news.
7287
You did?
7287
Oh yeah!
7287
Those were good times, when I helped you 8e gr8. ::::)
7287
That's awesome!!!!!!!!
7287
One time in an altern8te reality, I came pretty close to killing him apparently.
7287
You 8et. Too 8ad that was in a timeline that didn't really count. 8ut it's always reassuring to know you can put up a good fight against a strong adversary if you ever needed to. Now I guess you know you can too.
7287
What happened after you 8onked him on the head? I 8et he was mad.
7287
A white Jack?
7287
No fucking clue.
7287
Ok, that may 8e, 8ut it sure wasn't Jack who killed a whole shitload of ghosts out here, including one of yours.
7287
I really dou8t Jack can even kill ghosts. In fact, I don't think anyone can except for this guy.
7287
Lord English.
7287
Wow, John. Really?
7287
Wow.
7287
Time to get a clue!
7288
Hasn't it ever occurred to you to wonder who the ultim8 8ad guy of this adventure was going to 8e?
7288
Man, even that way of putting it is a little too pedestrian.
7288
I mean, I already 8eat a last 8oss! The 8lack king was the officially sanctioned last 8oss of our session, and I killed him. This is different.
7288
There's always someone stronger w8ing to 8e revealed. Jack showed up shortly after that, and he was MUCH stronger.
7288
Eventually the curtains get pulled 8ack, and you find out who was 8ehind every terri8le thing that happened all along. Someone who is invaria8ly stronger than all other adversaries 8y a wide margin. The supreme villain!
7288
To 8e honest, I was always kind of w8ing for that guy to show up, whoever he was. For the other shoe to drop, you know? There's always a 8ig 8ad 8ehind everything. A true gamer sees stuff like this coming a mile away.
7288
Yes, I'll admit, I was fooled 8y Jack 8riefly.
7288
For a little while, I thought he was the supreme menace, and I would have to face him in a final showdown.
7288
8ut it turned out that was just a 8it of standard misdirection. He was just another step up in a typical pattern of escal8tion involving increasingly "insurmounta8le" threats, which legendary heroes like us have to overcome to achieve total victory over everything.
7288
Also, let's face it. I don't think Jack is all that evil, so much as he's just a murderous asshole. Trust me, I know the type.
7288
8ut English, that guy is as evil as they come. He's the real deal!!!!!!!!
7288
Tavros, come on. We've already talked a8out this ad nauseum.
7288
He's the 8ig 8ad!!!!!!!! It's so o8vious. I mean, MAY8E there's someone stronger out there in paradox space? Who knows.
7288
8ut whoever that is has nothing to fucking do with this massive extended multiverse-spanning campaign!!!!!!!!
7288
English was the guy who stacked the whole deck against us from the start, rigging shit to go haywire, wiping out our race, 8lowing up universes, exterimin8ting ghosts, slaughtering dark gods, and shattering reality itself. Pretty sure we reached the top floor, 8uddy!
7288
Un8elieva8le.
7288
John, just ignore him. He tends to 8e contrary just for the sake of 8eing contrary. It's just what he does these days.
7288
He seems to think it's how you show confidence and assertiveness. The key to high self esteem is apparently just saying "nuh uh!" all the time.
7288
See?
7288
This was apparently the 8ig lesson he learned from sharing a 8rain with me for a few minutes. In order to feel good a8out yourself, just 8e a constant pain in the ass!!!!!!!!
7288
Alright, granted, there did in fact exist a person 8y that name.
7288
You aren't spelling it right, though.
7288
8ecause that's how you spelled it when we used to chat online, dum8ass!!!!!!!! You weren't using enough letters.
7288
And in any case, he doesn't actually represent your self esteem. He's just some dude.
7288
Lol. Whatever floats your 8oat.
7288
What?
7288
???????!
7289
You could say that.
7289
There's a pretty loaded history 8etween us. It's pro8a8ly 8est not to get into it.
7289
None of that matters anymore anyway, it was so long ago. You know how it is.
7289
Issues 8etween people seem like such a 8ig deal when they're happening. 8ut then you die, and time just goes on, and on........ then on some more.
7289
If enough time passes, shit that used to 8e a 8ig deal kind of stops mattering.
7289
Ok, full disclosure. I used to do a lot of terri8le things to Tavros.
7289
Once I launched him off a cliff and paralyzed him. And if that wasn't 8ad enough, I spent sweeps mocking him for the disa8ility I caused! Haha.
7289
Oh yeah. Then I killed him.
7289
Mm hm.
7289
8ut like I said, that's suuuuuuuuch old news now, it might as well not have even happened.
7289
Tavros doesn't give a shit a8out that stuff anymore.
7289
Hahahaha! John, can you 8elieve this guy?
7289
This is the kind of shit I have to deal with all the time.
7289
Tavros, the 8igger man is only ACTUALLY the 8igger man if he doesn't refer to himself as the 8igger man. That's kind of the point?
7289
Unless the intent is to produce some form of socially awkward comic relief, which let's face it, is what you're all a8out.
7289
8ut that's what I like a8out you.
7290
He's just some huge overpowered green freak. A time traveling monster, supposedly invinci8le.
7290
Who he is, what he is, where he came from, none of that really matters.
7290
What matters is how we're going to defeat him.
7290
That's what Tavros and I have 8een working on here for some time now.
7290
Treasure hunting!
7290
Yes. Ok, I should explain.
7290
There's sort of a plan in motion to 8eat English. It's a three pronged approach.
7290
A num8er of people out here in the furthest ring are working on different prongs of the strategy independently.
7290
The first is a quest to find the lost ghost of some alien girl. She's said to 8e one of the keys to defeating him in some way.
7290
Other people are allegedly out there working on that right now. If you ask me, it sounds like a really 8oring approach to defeating him. Who knows if it's even true.
7290
The second is a quest to raise an army of ghosts to challenge him directly in some kind of huge 8attle royale, I guess.
7290
From what I understand, some yahoo out there is 8usy rounding people up. I really have no idea how that's going. I usually just hear stuff through the grapevine.
7290
That approach doesn't really interest me either. Gonna file it under "8oring" as well. Seems a little heavy handed, not to mention too slow.
7290
The third prong is what Tavros and I are 8usy with. The aforementioned treasure hunt.
7290
The legend says there's some mystical ancient treasure hidden somewhere out here in the furthest ring.
7290
I'm assuming it's some kind of weapon. It's said that if you use it, or like, activ8te it in some way, he can 8e defeated forever.
7290
The nature of the treasure is pretty vague, actually. 8ut the first rule of treasure hunting, which I'm admittedly just making up now, is that it doesn't fucking matter what the treasure is.
7290
These three goals are all tied to the same legend which I've uncovered clues a8out over time. Legendary shit is everywhere out here. I'm seriously up to my ass in legend. Hell, I probably even qualify as a legend myself!!!!!!!!
7290
When it comes to solving a 8ig mystery like this, it doesn't hurt that everywhere we go, places are composed of the collective memories of many different adventurers.
7290
We've explored ancient crypts, networks of 8urial mounds, dusty old tom8s, giant pyramids, you name it. Hints a8out the endgame are hidden all over the place.
7290
Really, everyone's pretty lucky I died so I could do all the dirty work on this. Let's get real, no8ody's 8etter prepared to take on the treasure hunting duties than I am.
7290
Not that I'd have it any other way. This just sounds like the 8est plan to me. Why 8other messing around with an army of ghostly dipshits, or some shy magic alien when you can go str8 for the ultim8 weapon?
7290
Hell, may8e I'll just walk right up to him, one-shot the guy and end it all right there.
7290
That's how a real pro goes a8out 8usiness. You take any shortcut you find.
7290
Are you fuckers even listening to me???????? God DAMN it.
7290
No you're not. You're squa88ling with Tavros and his loud shitty whispering a8out some 8ullshit.
7290
Come on, guys. Am I really 8eing that 8oring?
7290
I'm really starting to understand how my ancestor must have felt sometimes. No8ody ever respects an important explan8tion!!!!!!!!
7290
Why are you still whispering jackass?!
7290
Sigh.
7290
8oth of you just keep your damn hands to yourselves, shut up, and let me finish my story.
7290
Tavros! 8ring me the treasure maps!!!!!!!!
7291
Yes, that's it. Dump them all over the floor a8out ten feet away from me, just like that.
7291
The sloppier the pile and the further away from me the 8etter. Gr8 jo8, Tavros.
7292
John, come take a look at this.
7292
Sort of! Pro8a8ly not like any maps you've seen.
7292
Check it out. This ought to help you understand how frustr8ting this treasure hunt really is.
7293
John, tell me what you see here.
7293
Right here.
7293
What is this? This thing I'm holding?
7293
No, John.
7293
This is 8ULLSHIT is what it is.
7293
This is what a map looks like in the furthest ring.
7293
This is what ALL maps look like out here.
7293
Turns out plotting the relative geographical features of an infinite 8lack expanse of pure void is every 8it as moronic as it sounds. 8ut that didn't stop some ancient eldritch chucklefuck from doing exactly that.
7293
For the longest time, this is all we've had to go on when it came to deciphering the clues and figuring out the coordin8tes of the legendary treasure.
7293
Do you have any idea how hard it is to pin down the physical location of something out here? Never mind the fact that physical location in the furthest ring is already a mallea8le concept. Just imagine what it's like giving someone directions! What do you tell them?
7293
Proceed in a str8 line shaped like a perpetually shifting torus knot until you feel a sense of despair transcending all mortal comprehension, then hang a right at the next octopus?
7293
There's nothing static out there. No landmarks, no points of reference. Nothing!
7293
If you want to make any headway in this gr8 8ig field of fuckall, SOMEONE has got to start wrecking some shit.
7293
Haha. I wish I had that kind of firepower. 8ut no.
7294
You wouldn't 8elieve my luck.
7294
You see, recently someone's 8een doing that dirty work for us.
7294
Want to know what the kicker is?
7295
The guy who's 8een fucking shit up is the 8ig 8ad himself!
7295
Every time he destroys another dream 8u88le, he does a little more damage to the furthest ring, inexplica8ly shattering the essence of all-encompassing nothingness.
7295
As the cracks spread across the void, new points of reference show up on our maps!
7295
Then we look at the angles and intersections and all the shapes formed 8y the cracks, and compare them to our notes from the various riddles and clues we've discovered a8out the path to the treasure.
7295
It's actually a little like how in old times on Alternia, pir8s used to navig8 8y shapes the stars made. Constell8tions used to have a lot of significance in our culture, not just guiding explorers on their journeys to physical destin8tions, 8ut guiding them on the choices they made in life, pertaining to f8 and all that. Not that humans would really understand anything like that.
7295
I actually find the situ8tion to 8e pretty funny. This guy's ego must 8e astronomical. Classic case of unchecked hu8ris paving the way for his own downfall.
7295
I didn't even need to 8uild a we8 to trap him. He just went ahead and started 8uilding his own.
7295
Talk a8out a lucky 8r8k!!!!!!!!
7296
No, 8ecause the map isn't complete yet!
7296
Needs more cracks so we can plot the rest of the course. All we're a8le to do now is head in the right general direction.
7296
So ironically in order to prevent reality from 8eing destroyed, we need to w8 for it to 8e damaged further. In fact, we're 8etter off encouraging it!
7296
Yes, 8ut it has to 8e strategic. We have to somehow lead him in the direction of the places we want him to damage.
7296
Specifically, the places where the route dead-ends. Wherever we need new points of reference to keep going.
7296
Not really. He's already pissed off. I think he's just permanently that way?
7296
It's more a8out getting his attention. Using the right 88! Like going fishing.
7296
8ut to do that, you gotta know what he really wants. Like what motiv8tes him. I mean, 8esides indiscrimin8tely killing dead children and huge tentacle monsters.
7296
Sure. The rumor is he's trying to find that dead alien girl I mentioned, and kill her ghost for good.
7296
If he catches on to the fact that some of us are looking for her too, and thinks we're hot on her trail, he'll pro8a8ly start following us around and wreaking havoc wherever we go.
7296
We just have to make sure we're in the right place when he tries to kill us. Oh, also try not to actually die again while we're at it. Haha.
7296
Sort of! It's actually more the 8ogus idea that we'll lead him to the cheru8, 8ecause we're looking for her too. Which we're o8viously not.
7296
There's some manipul8tion involved.
7296
That's a pretty good question. Have to admit, I don't have everything quite figured out yet.
7296
Shhhhhhh! I'm still talking!
7296
Nice sentence, genius! Anyway, like I was saying........
7296
I'm hoping my exploits can spread throughout the ring 8y word of mouth. Tales of my legend, you know?
7296
Then once he catches on, he'll come looking for us, and then presuma8ly go apeshit with his rain8ow laser 8reath. Metaphysical cataclysm ensues.
7296
Oh, shut up.
7296
I said it's a work in progress!!!!!!!!
7296
We might need to make a 8igger spectacle of ourselves somehow. Get more people involved. I don't know.
7296
It does seems like he's more drawn toward gr8ter concentr8tions of ghosts.
7296
There's still plenty of time to figure it out. That's one thing a8out 8eing dead. There's always more time.
7296
Plus, needless to say, lady luck will ALWAYS 8e on our side! ::::)
7297
You think so?
7297
Aw, you guys. You're making me 8lush.
7297
Don't mind him, John. He's just 8eing weird and tooly again.
7297
It was nice to see you and catch up like this. If we don't meet in another dream soon, don't worry.
7297
I have a feeling we'll 8e crossing paths again 8efore this is all over!
7852
Hey, it's John!
7852
Yeah! Get over here!!!!!!!!
7853
Nice to see you again, John. It's 8een too long.
7853
A year for you, may8e. Who even knows how long it's 8een out here, 8ut who cares.
7853
The point is, as you can see the plan I descri8ed to you 8efore is in full swing.
7853
Yes. 8ut they aren't 8lack anymore! Not totally.
7853
Everything's gone exactly as I intended. English has taken the 88, hook line and sinker.
7853
He's 8een chasing our "extended party" around the ring, 8lowing shit up with his monster 8reath, thus revealing the path to the treasure in the process.
7853
I must say, for an evil mastermind, the guy is kind of a dope.
7853
Supposedly his every move is a carefully calcul8ted ploy to assure his existence in the first place, yet here he is wrecking the joint like an oaf, unwittingly helping the hero find the weapon that will finally take him down.
7853
And we're almost there, too! Although 8y now it's 8ecome em8arrassingly o8vious that the treasure was hidden right around where we started all along.
7853
These maps have just 8een leading us all in a 8ig stupid circle!
7853
I should have seen it coming. I guess that's my 8ad. In terms of 8onehead moves, that's English: 1, Vriska: 1, so I guess we're even. 8ut may8e we don't have to mention that detail when we document my heroism in the annals of gr8tness.
7853
Exactly!
7853
Haha, I almost forgot how deceptively quick you are on the uptake, John.
7853
Tavros, if you're going to interrupt, don't mum8le. And even then, don't.
7853
Anyway, I really don't mind the fact that these cryptic treasure maps have led us all on a wild honk8ird chase.
7853
I've never once complained a8out a good long treasure hunt, and I'm not a8out to start now.
7853
8esides, with the way spacetime works out here, who can say for sure we would 8e a8le to find the treasure at all unless we traced this exact path?
7853
No8ody can say that, is who. Least of all English, who as far as I know, can't actually speak so much as issue 8lood curdling roars that cleave the found8tions of reality itself.
7853
You're of course welcome to join us on our adventure, for as long as you're asleep.
7853
We could use another hand on deck. I'll even give you a rank and title!
7853
Wrong.
7853
Tavros, who's the captain here?
7853
Last time I checked, it wasn't Swa88y Nitram, Poopmaster Extraordinaire.
7854
We all look amazing as pir8tes.
7854
This is non-negotia8le.
7855
These are my friends, Aradia and Sollux.
7855
I have recruited them for this expedition as specialists.
7855
They aren't really here to do any fighting. 8ut their a8ilities will 8ecome useful once we retrieve the treasure.
7855
Yeah, and apparently she intends to stay that way?
7855
Hence her principled if somewhat lame commitment to pacifism.
7855
8ut considering our history together, I'm willing to let 8ygones 8e 8ygones. I'm happy to have her on my crew in whatever capacity she likes.
7855
Hey!!!!!!!!
7855
What did I say a8out 8ygones 8eing 8ygones? That's like rule fucking ONE of this ship.
7855
Anyway, she 8ecame a ro8ot and killed me 8ack, so o8viously we're cool now.
7855
Yeah! Man, those were the days.
7855
It's really kind of a shame Gamzee prototyped Eridan's torso parts and swiped his ghost from the afterlife.
7855
I 8et he would have had a gr8 time on this voyage. I used to own him during our nautical campaigns all the time!
7855
Gimme a 8r8k, Sollux. As if you don't view them the exact same way.
7855
You've got real Eridan, and then pretty much a whole 8unch of pretenders out there.
7855
See? You just called them copies. Even you can't avoid accidentally using a pro8lematic slur which reveals that no matter what you 8elieve a8out your morals, deep down you're always gonna favor the original, while viewing all the others as duplic8tes of lesser value.
7855
Oh pleeeeeeeease. I hardly think I'm a 8ad person for failing to give a shit a8out a 8illion meaningless dead Nepetas, do you?!
7855
What am I seriously supposed to do? Fly around and 8efriend each one individually?
7855
Sorry, I have 8etter things to do with my time. Let's try to 8e at least somewhat practical here.
7855
Oh shut up.
7856
Of course!
7856
That's my army.
7856
Ok, I mean OUR army.
7856
8ut like, on 8oats.
7856
John, help me out. I seem to 8e having trou8le remem8ering which one of us is the captain.
7856
Was it the dork in 8lue pajamas, or was it the veteran sailor in the rad captain's coat?
7856
That's right, the captain was me! And I say it's an army that happens to 8e on a 8unch of 8oats.
7856
Thousands of ghosts. Primarily those of old friends and acquaintances.
7857
We've amassed a coalition of eager volunteers ready to lay down their ghost lives for a worthy cause.
7857
When we're ready for that, yes. 8ut we need the treasure first.
7857
So for now they're sailing well ahead of us in large num8ers to attract his attention, so he can do more damage to the ring and fill out the rest of our maps.
7857
We should 8e very gr8teful for their 8ravery. They are making a no8le sacrifice for us all.
7857
God DAMMIT, Tavros.
7857
We really don't need your play 8y play commentary on everything!
7857
No!
7857
Well, not all of them.
7857
Once you group enough together, others tend to latch on to the mo8 out of curiosity. We trolls have a way of clustering together naturally.
7857
You've got to understand, John. Most of these people are pretty self a8sor8ed. They just needed a little 8it of persuasion to join the cause.
7857
8ut all these stu88orn jackasses are going to dou8le die anyway if we don't all work together and kill this guy!
7857
This is WAR, John. In times of war, difficult decisions have to 8e made with the lives of many.
7857
Just think of me as a general giving orders to my troops. It just happens that the orders are a little more direct in this case.
7857
Yeah yeah.
7857
All hail Her Imperious Teen Condescension, the fresh new face of tyranny, Supreme Admiral Peixes.
7857
At this time I would like to motion for a fifteen minute 8owing 8r8k so that we may demonstr8te our reverence for this 8old, spunky leader.
7857
Tavros, stop 8owing. That was a joke.
7857
Well, I do have a little help.
7857
John, did I mention?
7857
My ancestor........
7857
She is THE 8EST.
7857
See what I mean??
7857
The 8est.
7857
Well put, Marquise. I've always felt the exact same way!
7879
No, John. It's definitely pretty weird that ghosts have to pee.
7879
You get used to life as a ghost pretty fast, though.
7879
Yeah. That's why you get used to it pretty fast, dummy!
7907
WOW, WHAT A STORY!!!!!!!!
7907
WASN'T THAT STORY GR8 EVERYONE?
7907
WOW!!!!!!!!
7908
Hell yeah!
7908
Oh my god. That leprechaun stuff? Soooooooo good.
7908
Right guys?
7908
Mindfang, have I told you how gr8 it's 8een to get to know each other, and team up on adventures and stuff?
7908
I really feel like you've helped me get in touch with my ancestral roots. Mainly as a kickass storyteller.
7908
It was like this whole part of my personality I was never aware of. Like the part that's compelled to just outright explain tons of really interesting things to people, while sparing no detail whatsoever.
7908
It's made me feel a lot closer to understanding my aspect, as well as closer to you. So I just wanted to say, thanks!
7908
Haha, stop! You're going to make me start tearing up.
7908
Get over here and give me a hug, alpha sister.
7925
Hey guys! Stop dragging your feet 8ack there! You're falling so far 8ehind, you're starting to look tiny and ridiculous from here.
7925
The treasure should 8e 8uried just up ahead. Let's pick up the pace!
7925
Sollux, will you just let Aranea heal your eyes already and catch the fuck up?
7931
Are you coming or what!
7934
W8 a minute........
7935
Mindfang, I said shut up.
7935
W8.
7935
Now w8 just a goddamn minute.
7935
Hoooooooold on.
7935
Are you telling me,
7935
Are you SERIOUSLY telling me,
7935
That ring........
7935
No.
7935
Just........
7935
Noooooooo.
7935
8ack it up.
7935
For just a silk spinning MINUTE.
7936
THAT FUCKING GUY!!!!!!!!
7937
Are you kidding me.
7938
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
7939
RAAAAAAAARARRAAUUUUUUUUAAAAUUAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!
7940
Tavros!!!!!!!!
7940
What did you do with that ring?!
7941
Don't play dum8 with me. That ring you had.
7941
You know, the same one the orange guy tried to give me?
7941
You actually think I'm making this up? Why would I make up a story a8out an orange guy?!
7941
What kind of juvenile fuckup do you take me for????????
7941
The orange guy was real. He was surrounded 8y a 8unch of stupid fucking horses, and he tried to give me a ring so I knocked him out cold.
7941
And then l8ter YOU found it.
7941
Yes you did! Don't lie to me.
7941
You had the ring, and you and John were fighting over it 8ehind your 8acks like a couple of idiots for a while.
7941
What, you think I didn't notice?!
7941
Well I did! And I didn't care 8ecause I didn't think the ring did jack shit!
7941
8ut now that I know it does jack A WHOLE FUCKING LOT, I would like you to stop 8ehaving like a disingenuous, argument8tive ASSH8LE and T8LL ME WHERE IT IS.
7941
What do you mean it's gone!
7942
Why was it precious to you?? Are you telling me you knew what it did!
7942
Well whatever lame reason you wanted that ring, forget it. It's o8viously a much more important magical item than either of us gave it credit for.
7942
As soon as we get the treasure out of this cave, you're going to lead us 8ack to wherever you lost it, and we're gonna look for it!
7942
Is that understood, Poopmaster Nitram????????
7942
What do you mean no? That was an order!
7942
Tavros, what exactly are you trying to say?
7943
Where do you think you're going?!
7943
Get 8ack here! You c8n't just fly aw8y from me like th8t!!!!!!!!
7943
S8LF ESTEEMS MY 8SS! I SAID G8T 8ACK HERE!!!!!!!!
7943
IF YOU GO OUT THERE AL8NE YOU'RE G8ING TO DIE, Y8U P8THETIC PI8CE OF SHIT!!!!!!!!
7944
WE CAN ALL HEAR YOU WH8SPERING FROM D8WN HERE SHIT F8R 8RAINS!!!!!!!!
7945
What?? No, Sollux, w8!
7945
WHAT!
7945
No they f8cking won't!!!!!!!!
7945
I d8dn't hear them say shit!
7945
YOU'RE BLIND, H8W COULD YOU SEE A "ME8NINGFUL GLANCE"????????
7945
No, they can't go! Commodore Nepeta and Rear Admiral Feferi are 8oth critical mem8ers of my crew!
7945
This is mutiny!!!!!!!!
7945
Excuse me?!
7945
No they don't! Come on, I just gave them titles that sounded cool!
7945
How can you outrank a captain????????
7945
A commodore outranks a captain?!
7945
No, 8ut!
7945
I thought a rear admiral was like...
7945
Some sort of JOKE rank!
7945
Who can take a rear admiral seriously? It might as well 8e a poopmaster!
7947
GOOD RIDD8NCE YOU 8ACKSTA88ING INGR8TES!
7947
I HOPE LORD ENGLISH E8TS YOU 8LL!!!!!!!!
7947
WH8T!
7947
What a8out it!
7947
You do??
7947
Where! Let me see!!
7947
You were wearing it??
7947
Why? And why were you playing keepaway with it in the first place!
7947
I mean, aside from the o8vious fact that messing with Tavros is its own hilarious reward.
7947
This is perfect!
7947
That means all you have to do is put it on when you wake up, then come find me the next time you go to sleep!
7948
May8e?
7948
You'll THINK a8out it??
7948
Right! All the 8etter reason to let me use it!
7948
W8. You're not ACTUALLY thinking of giving it to someone else, are you?
7948
That's my ring! The orange guy gave it to ME!
7948
John, w8!
7948
I hope we're not parting on 8ad terms here.
7948
You aren't holding all this treasure hunting shit against me like Tavros is, right?
7948
We're still cool, right John?
7948
If you have to leave, I get that, 8ut I really want us to stay friends!
7948
I always felt like we had a special 8ond, John. Like we're 8oth always in the position of having to take charge as leaders, even if we never asked for that responsi8ility.
7948
And I don't wanna pressure you into anything, 8ut I would really appreci8 it if you'd at least think a8out me next time you take a nap with that ring on!
7948
Even if they're what?
7949
Honestly what?
7950
Fine.
7950
Don't give me the ring then.
7950
Actually, you know what? Even if you change your mind some day, forget it!
7950
I don't even want it anymore.
7950
No.
7950
I've 8een dead this long. What's a little longer.
7950
Keep your ring. I don't want anyone's pity.
7950
So 8eat it, Eg8ert.
7950
........
7950
WELL????????
7950
JOHN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEAVING.
7950
WHAT ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT?! DON'T GO YET.
7950
Look, you made yourself perfectly clear. You think I'm a heartless monster, and you don't want to help me out.
7950
Whatever!
7950
8ut are you SERIOUSLY going to check out of this dream like TWO MINUTES 8efore you see what the treasure is?!
7950
Holy crap, dude. Where is your sense of curiosity????????
7950
If I can manage to put up with you for a little longer, I think you can stand my morally 8ankrupt company long enough to find out what this thing is.
7950
Why am I the only person in paradox space who actually THINKS!
7950
Good.
7951
Party's over, folks.
7951
The pir8 playtime wiggler jam8oree was fun while it lasted.
7951
8ut it's time to get serious.
7952
The treasure's down there.
7952
If my guess is right, it should 8e 8uried in one of his ancient memories.
7952
8y now we've all 8een wind8agged to hell and 8ack 8y my dear ancestor.
7952
So I'll trust no8ody's gonna mind indulging one of MY stories.
7952
There was a pretty good yarn a8out this treasure I read once during our travels.
7952
Found it in some damn memory, who knows whose.
7952
It was a good read. IMPECCA8LE prose. Failing to do it justice would be the real matter of gray morality here, if you ask me.
7952
8ut right now I 8n't in the mood to figure out how not to make it fucking suck.
7952
So I'll just say this.
7952
It was supposedly a weapon that once 8elonged to him.
7952
8ut he could never use it without altering its nature.
7952
Meaning he could only use it once.
7952
So he did.
7952
After that, it could only 8e used again one more time.
7952
And only as a weapon against him.
7952
Knowing it was one of the keys to his defeat, he had it locked away deep in the void.
7952
That's it. Part one of my story. Hold your applause.
7952
Guess we'll find out if that's true.
7952
Or if it turns out all my despica8le shit was in vain.
7953
Not that it would even matter to some people.
7953
You know, they can say whatever they want a8out me.
7953
8ut somewhere out there is a shimmering new universe growing in a 8ig 8all of water.
7953
He's looking hells of majestic. Amphi8ious and resplendent. His glorious croak would 8ring you to your knees.
7953
That universe is going to give life to 8illions of trillions of zillions of cute little aliens.
7953
You wouldn't even 8elieve how pretty and wonderful and happy all these aliens will 8e. It's making your lip trem8le just thinking a8out them, and how worth saving they are. Wow.
7953
You could walk up to one of those aliens and put your hand on its innocent shoulder, and with a str8 face you could say, "Sorry to 8r8k it to you. 8ut tomorrow, a guy named Lord English is going to destroy your universe. You are all going to die."
7953
And when that alien looks up at you with tears in its eyes, just 8efore the first one rolls down its weird alien cheek, you lean in close to its a8surd alien ear and whisper, "Psyche."
7953
That's 8ecause you know a long time ago, in an o8scure pocket of reality the alien could never understand or give a shit a8out, some crazy girl sacrificed the "lives" of a 8unch ghosts in order to kill that guy forever.
7953
They were already a million sweeps past their prime, existing on 8orrowed time, luxuri8ting in a kind of 8izarre metaphysical longevity few others will ever enjoy.
7953
Just a fresh 8atch of 88 the squid gods kept on ice for an ins8tia8le fisherman cause they were sick of 8eing hunted themselves.
7953
Those ghosts were all that stood in the way of an end to this eternal holocaust, and sparing their souls 8n't different in my view from personally committing atrocities on a cosmic fucking scale.
7953
I only ever wanted to do the right thing no matter how it made people judge me, and I don't need a magic ring to do that.
7953
You don't have to 8e alive to make yourself relevant.
7953
And you don't have to 8e a good person to 8e a hero.
7953
You just have to know who you are and stay true to that.
7953
So I'm going to keep fighting for people the only way I ever knew how.
7954
8y 8eing me.
7973
Will you guys hurry up??
7973
This is seriously some of the most half assed treasure hunting I've ever seen.
7974
Yeah!
7974
Yes, that was going to 8e part two of my story.
7974
Which starts right now!
7974
This thing is some sort of juju.
7974
As I'm sure you know 8y now, jujus are magic items that can do all sorts of things. 8end time and space, trap souls inside them, stuff like that.
7974
The more potent jujus tend to 8e pretty versatile. I dou8t even he knew the full extent of its powers.
7974
He supposedly got this thing as a 8oon for slaying a very powerful denizen. As if the guy even needed any more sick endgame rewards.
7974
That's all I'm gonna say for the moment, since I'm sure everyone is dying to see it 8y now.
7974
Only a complete asshole would make us w8 any longer to get a look at this thing.
7982
OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
7982
OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
7982
WE'RE G8ING TO LOOK AT WH8T'S IN THIS CH8ST RIGHT N8W!!!!!!!!
7982
DO YOU HE8R ME Y8U F8CK?
7982
I D8DN'T SCRAPE AND CLAW MY W8Y 8ACK TO RELEV8NCE F8R THIS SHIT!
7982
I'M DOING S8METHING F8CKING IMPORTANT! AND WHEN I DO SOMETH8NG FUCKING IMPORT8NT, EVERY88DY 8ETTER D8MN WELL PAY ATT8NTION TO ME!!!!!!!!
7982
YOU DON'T TH8NK I'M ON TO YOU 8Y NOW? AS IF I C8N'T SENSE WH8N SOME SORT OF 8ULLFUCKERY IS AFOOT????????
7982
YOU DON'T THINK 8'M WISE TO YO8R FUCKING G8MES????????
7982
GO AHEAD! TRY AND FUCK W8TH US SOME M8RE!
7982
MAKE MY D8Y YOU PI8CE OF SHIT!
7982
EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO KNOW WH8T'S IN THIS CHEST, SO THAT'S EX8CTLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SEE!
7982
THERE'S PRO8A8LY SOME IDEAL WAY FOR ME TO REVEAL THIS THING TO M8KE IT SEEM AS COOL AS POSSI8LE, 8UT Y8U KNOW WHAT!
7982
I DON'T GIVE A F8CK!!!!!!!!
7982
I'M JUST G8NNA DUMP IT OUT ON THE FLOOR RIGHT HERE AND NOW!
7983
THERE!
7983
FUCKING TH8RE!!!!!!!!
7983
TAAAAAAAA DAAAAAAAA!
7983
W8W WILL YOU LOOK AT TH8T!
7983
IT'S THE FUCK8NG TREASURE!
7983
LOOKS LIKE SOME K8ND OF HUMAN HOUSE SHAPED THING! H8LY SHIT, DIDN'T SEE THAT C8MING!!!!!!!!
7983
NOW EVERYONE HOLD YOUR FUCKING H8RSES WHILE I ARTLESSLY EXPLAIN SOME MORE SHIT A8OUT IT!
7983
WOOOOOOOO! HERE FUCKING G8ES!
7984
AFTER THE GUY USED IT THAT ONE TIME, IT 8ECAME TOTALLY INTANGI8LE! SO WE CAN'T TOUCH IT OR PICK IT UP!
7984
THAT'S WHY WE 8ROUGHT ARADIA ALONG! SO SHE CAN MAKE IT LEVIT8 OR WHATEVER!
7984
IF WE 8RING IT NEAR HIM IT'S SUPPOSED TO ACTIV8 AGAIN OR SOMETHING! THAT'S HOW YOU USE IT AS A WEAPON I GUESS!
7984
8UT THAT'S ALL I KNOW!!!!!!!!
7984
THERE! YOU LIKE TH8T YOU FUCK?
7984
DO YOU LIKE HOW I JUST TOOK THE FUCKING PISS OUT OF TH8T COOL MYSTERIOUS TREASURE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
7984
DO YOU LIKE GETTING OWNED????????
7984
8ECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST GOT! OWNED!!!!!!!!
7984
SO WHY DON'T YOU SUCK IT!
7985
SUUUUUUUUCK........
7986
IIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!
7987
*Huff puff.*
7992
Yes.
7992
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what intangi8le means!
7992
I dunno if I would do that if I were you.
7993
It's not just a8out you, John.
7993
This is a very powerful juju. You'd 8e messing with some forces we don't fully understand.
7993
Oh my god.
7993
Alright, whatever. I'll 8e fucked if suddenly I'm gonna 8e the lone voice of prudence and sound judgment in our 8adass pir8 clu8.
7993
If you really wanna plunge your fist through some sort of hole in reality, then 8e my guest!
8008
John, will you get your hand out of there?
8008
You're vaguely fucking shit up in some totally am8iguous way.
8009
John!!!!!!!!
8647
To 8e honest, I don't even want to hear any more.
8647
Next time you have an upd8 on what my ancestor has 8een up to, please just keep it to yourself.
8648
It's em8arrassing!
8648
I cringe every time I think a8out her self-indulgent exploits.
8648
Doesn't she realize this sort of thing never works?
8648
You don't just go and insert yourself into the middle of all the action in the most hamfisted way possi8le just 8ecause you can't stand another second 8eing out of the spotlight.
8648
That always goes horri8ly for everyone.
8648
Even worse, it ends up making you look like an idiot.
8648
And even MORE worse, it's making ME look like an idiot 8y associ8tion!
8648
Why couldn't she have thought this through a little more?
8648
Why couldn't she have at least TOLD us first?
8648
How is it that I understand this and she doesn't?
8648
She's HOW much older than me?
8648
Like a 8ajillion dream 8u88le sweeps or something?
8648
All that experience and wisdom, and she's out there floundering around like fucking noo8.
8648
It's so disheartening. She wants to 8e like Marquise so much, just like I used to.
8648
8ut she is NOTHING like her!
8648
You kind of need to have a fuck ton of experience doing, you know... a lot of ruthless pir8tey shit 8efore you can pull that off?
8648
You can't just 8e a 8ookish dwee8 all your life, then suddenly decide to flip the 8adass switch and expect people to take you seriously.
8648
Also, to truly pull that off, it MIGHT help to actually 8e a goddamned adult.
8648
I know, I must 8e totally off my swaychair for suggesting it. 8ut may8e, just MAY8E, there are certain roles and 8ehaviors which are 8est left to fully developed, grown ass people!
8648
Not to sound like a wet 8lanket, 8ut my ancestor's journal contained some EXTREMELY mature content!
8648
So now we have yet another stupid kid trying to fill the 8oots of a legendary pir8 queen, and it's amateur hour all over again.
8648
All I can see in her is me when I used to........
8648
And it makes me want to........
8648
UGHHHHHHHH!
8648
Sorry.
8648
I'm just dismayed 8y some of the implic8tions of her actions.
8648
Is this really how I came off when I used to pull this sort of shit?
8648
I have a sickening feeling it was just like this.
8648
No wonder no8ody could stand me.
8648
And here I am, 8itching at my ancestor like I know 8etter, like I've evolved 8eyond all that.
8648
8ut........
8648
Have I really?
8648
Do I go around thinking I'm smarter than I used to 8e, 8ut end up repeating all the same old patterns without even realizing it?
8648
Was the plan to find this treasure and 8uild an army just a rest8tement of my immature, egomaniacal 8ullshit disguised as a more "strategically sensi8le" plan?
8648
If I can apparently keep kidding myself a8out this crap forever, then how would I know the difference?
8648
I guess the thing I h8 most a8out her stunt isn't that it's a dum8 plan, or that we weren't included.
8648
It's that it's making me wonder if I can trust any of my own judgments, even after all this time.
8648
I don't know a8out that.
8648
If it's so 8aller, why is it making me feel like shit?
8648
I guess.
8648
What a8out you?
8648
Does any of this reson8 at all?
8648
I know you used to stir up shit with your friends.
8648
You must have done some outrageous things which you thought were necessary for the good of the team. When you look 8ack, do you ever wonder what you were thinking? Or if you ever truly evolved?
8648
Oh, come on.
8648
Don't leave me hanging in self dou8t lim8o here.
8648
Gimme SOMETHING, Peixes.
8648
You don't care if you make mistakes?
8648
YES.
8648
That is so right on.
8648
If you asked me a long time ago, I'm sure I would have insisted that's exactly how I felt a8out everything I did too.
8648
8ut I don't know if that's true anymore.
8648
In fact, I'm sure that WASN'T true.
8648
I was always invested as hell in the consequences of everything I did, and how it made me look.
8648
And how it made me feel a8out myself especially.
8648
Well of course.
8648
Who the fuck wants to 8e poor?
8648
That's for losers.
8649
Anyway, I have no idea what to do now.
8649
Her ill-advised power play has ruined everything.
8649
I don't think so.
8649
If you want to know the truth........
8649
When we were manipul8ting all those ghosts, Aranea was doing most of the work.
8649
Her a8ilities are a lot more advanced than mine. I guess 8ecause she's 8een around for so long?
8649
I was kind of riding her coattails, making it seem like it was a true colla8oration 8etween us.
8649
It was actually very nice of her to allow people to get that impression. She didn't have to.
8649
I should have just told every8ody that. I guess I wanted to 8elieve it too. Like we were equal partners in crime. Ancestor and descendant united at last, and working gr8 together.
8649
I hope you don't think that makes me a huge phony.
8649
Yeah.
8649
You're right, you wouldn't.
8649
I shouldn't 8e saying needy shit like that.
8649
I'm just a 8it depressed, 8ecause it feels like I'm running out of friends all over again.
8649
Same.
8649
I don't know.
8649
Possi8ly?
8649
The way I was picturing it, a major feature of the original three pronged approach was to use the army to lead a first wave assault against him.
8649
Then while he was preoccupied 8y all those ghosts swamping him, I would go in for the kill with the secret weapon.
8649
So without an army, I guess we'd need to get close enough to him to use it 8efore he killed us.
8649
I guess.
8649
8ut I get the feeling Lord English is not the kind of guy you can just sneak up on.
8649
Hahahaha.
8649
That would 8e awesome, if somewhat implausi8le.
8649
I guess we can think it over.
8649
8ut if we're getting real here, this has all made me feel pretty lukewarm on the plan.
8649
Aranea checking the fuck out. And me recoiling at her hu8ris, which is o8viously just........
8649
My OWN 8ullshit, getting thrown 8ack in my face?
8649
It's a 8it much.
8649
You have to 8e a8le to trust your own judgment to make good plans, right?
8649
I don't know if I do anymore.
8649
I certainly don't right now.
8649
Remem8er when our crew started re8elling against me in that cave, and I was kind of lashing out?
8649
I think I might have 8een forcing it a little?
8649
Like that whole dramatic speech I gave when I jumped into the flaming pit.
8649
Was that really a genuine thing, or like, a desper8te last attempt to 8e who I think I should 8e?
8649
It wasn't supposed to 8e funny though!!!!!!!!
8649
Ah man.
8649
I really don't know what to do.
8649
I'm too depressed to think proactively a8out any of this.
8649
May8e the truth is I don't even care all that much if anyone stops Lord English.
8649
I think all I really cared a8out was getting to do it myself.
8649
What if we just........
8649
Gave up on the mission?
8649
Yeah.
8649
What do you think.
8649
Sure?
8649
You don't think that would 8e a wussy move?
8649
That's a very good point.
8649
