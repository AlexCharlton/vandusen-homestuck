6036
Jane!
6036
Forgive my botherations. I know this is meant to be a spanking ripsnorter of a day for you and all.
6036
But do you happen to know where the devilfucking dickens mr strider might be?
6036
Egad...
6036
*Loosens collar a bit.*
6036
Shoot.
6036
I really need to ask him something but hes got his blasted auto responder turned on.
6036
He wouldnt be pleased to hear you say that.
6036
It most certainly does and time is of the essence!
6036
Today is the day i have to finish it and send it. Not a day later!
6036
So you see why i am feeling really friggin discombobulated at the moment.
6036
No!
6036
It is for your grandfather simply to be *relayed* to him by my grandmother. A joint gift to him from she and i.
6036
What? Who and you now?
6036
Oh for frigs flipping sake jane this is no time for your prudish pedantry! Leave your bookish malarkey in a dusty old library somewhere. I have an adventure to get on with!
6036
Bingo. *double pistols and a wink*
6036
Please jane we have addressed this.
6036
I am sending the gift back in time to when they are both alive and about our age.
6036
Or...
6036
Something like that. Something funny is going on here that i have not fully grappled yet but dag nab it if im not gonna see it through.
6036
Are you being fresh with me now?
6036
Look jane i know youve never believed me and you think everything i say is some big cockamamie goofoff but i think today of all days is when you should start taking some things more seriously.
6036
Especially since i have always had your back. I have always believed in you!
6036
Is that so!
6036
Oh my. *glasses fog up. fumbles for kerchief.*
6036
What was i doing there?
6036
Too true.
6036
Let us reconvene later and sort out all this shit at a leisurely pace.
6036
Okay you too jane! Bye!
6081
Ahoy madame!
6081
Im determined as ever to see this through. But as usual events have conspired to make a boondoggle of the prospect.
6081
I think i might be fucked.
6081
Terry needs fuel and i dont have any left. I think im at striders dubious mercy for a solution YET AGAIN.
6081
I will have to ask him for help. And soon.
6081
Yes i will.
6081
But also...
6081
Theres the matter of the rabbits armaments.
6081
I dont imagine hell do a lot of friggin good in helping grandfather crocker from kicking the old bucket without them.
6081
Did you not say youd supply these?
6081
You did??
6081
When?
6081
I see...
6081
Yes it sure is if that is the case.
6081
Then all thats left to do is find power for it...
6081
Oh and also enough power for the stupid transmateriabob. Augh!
6081
So much to do before shuttling this goddamn thing into the past.
6081
I mean...
6081
That is what im doing right? Giving it to my grandma when she was a kid growing up on the same island i did?
6081
These are among the dadblasted causal spoilers you refuse to dish out?
6081
Im not sure i completely followed that but ok.
6081
So you are still in contention that i will meet our elders as youths?
6081
Ah ha! Then i WILL be traveling through time. I knew it.
6081
Or... they will be. Whichever it is.
6081
Which is it, btw?
6081
Fffff.
6081
Oh.
6081
Well shit!
6081
This is frightfully exciting. I would love to meet them.
6081
I never got to know my grandma very well and it always seemed like she led an amazing and adventurous life.
6081
Then this seemed to be proven true in my correspondence with her. So im really looking forward to it.
6081
I remember you mentioned your race doesnt really jive with ours familially speaking?
6081
Well yes ours do too. But generally we have all these other people in between them and the most recent ones are called parents.
6081
so i guess you do not have those? Like systemically?
6081
well neither did i!!!
6081
Miss alien i think we are like birds of a feather you and i.
6081
When do i get to learn your name by the way?
6081
But...
6081
Wait!
6081
There are still some things id like to know!
6081
About today! About this game!
6081
Yes fine fine ok i will but...
6081
Just please tell me in the least causally spoilery way possible...
6081
What are we even trying to accomplish here? What is even the rootin tootin POINT of this game?
6084
Bro.
6084
Ahem.
6084
Are you there?
6084
I hate to be a pest about this and i know ive made a hearty trouble of myself a good deal lately...
6084
I should preface this request with an overture of appreciation.
6084
For how much your cool and brotherly friendship means to me.
6084
It has just been...
6084
Absolutely *bully* having a standup gent like you in my corner.
6084
Just a grade a dude whos a cut above the others in class and camaraderie.
6084
Phew... *gropes for fresh kerchief.*
6084
I hope this shit isnt coming across as platitudinous. I really mean it!
6084
I...
6084
Oh. Yes! But of course.
6084
The ironies!
6084
Good grief how i was bandying them just now. You know me dude.
6084
*Blows smoke off red hot irony pistol.*
6084
*NONSUGGESTIVELY!!!!!*
6084
Um.
6084
Yeah.
6084
Pshaw! As if i would be so reckless with the stuff.
6084
I would have to be mighty irresponsible to run out already.
6084
No no im all set in the uranium department and really when you take a look at the big picture youll find i am *sitting pretty* when it comes to just about any radioactive isotope you could mention.
6084
However...
6084
My backup reserves that i keep strictly for emergencies are running a little lean!
6084
You know what my grandma taught me about preparedness. *Tugs at colorful lapels.*
6084
Christ what an insufferable awesome friend you are.
6084
Ok can you please just sendificate me some more already?? Im in kind of a hurry!
6084
What?
6084
Oh i know you would its just...
6084
Damn it man ive told you this is just something i have to do myself.
6084
Its a promise i made to jade and im going to live up to it even if im not the best or even second best robosmith i know!
6084
Frig!!!!!
6084
Why not???
6084
Ok then! Im halfassing it!
6084
Look. See? Only a bisected bottom is present! Where is the other half you ask?
6084
Why... it is nowhere to be found. I didnt use it!
6084
Jesus christmas you are such a fucking douche.
6084
I knew you were going to suggest this. I dont know why i bothered asking!
6084
Strider why must you always be such an obstinate stick in the mud???
6084
Wait...
6084
"It seems"??
6084
Oh for fucks sake.
6084
This is your auto responder.
6085
Har har har!
6085
Just soooo "*irooooonic*!!!" Quotes quotes quotes.
6085
Im laughing my caboose STRAIGHT OFF THE TRACKS! A lot of families just died in the tragic derailment.
6085
Laughter isnt an emotion dickprince!
6085
Man its so flipping obvious.
6085
You start getting kind of extra technical and vague and automoton like.
6085
And kind of aloof and brusque.
6085
I mean...
6085
Even aloofier and brusquier than usual!
6085
Also you use the phrase "it seems" a lot. Its so silly it really blows the AI immersion man.
6085
Ok then check this out mr legit human dude.
6085
Excuse me sir not to be a bother but could you please tell me all about this strider fellows auto responder?
6085
You see!
6085
Because you always say shit like that after i catch wise to your games.
6085
You as in the auto responder!!!
6085
Oh yeah?
6085
Hey. Tell me about the auto responder. Make it snappy shitknickers!
6085
Gee dude you sure typed that exact same thing pretty fast.
6085
Are you still fucking with me??
6085
You always type that answer!!!!!
6085
Uuuuuuugh.
6085
I cant stand this. Every time we do this and i just wind up whistling sweet dixie out of my bum hole!
6085
This is pointless im not having this conversation unless its with my REAL LIFE FRIEND. THE ONE WITH HUMAN FEELINGS WHO ISNT A PRETEND PERSON INSIDE SUNGLASSES.
6088
Jane!
6088
Forgive my botherations. I know this is meant to be a spanking ripsnorter of a day for you and all.
6088
But do you happen to know where the devilfucking dickens mr strider might be?
6088
Egad...
6088
*Loosens collar a bit.*
6088
Shoot.
6088
I really need to ask him something but hes got his blasted auto responder turned on.
6088
He wouldnt be pleased to hear you say that.

It most certainly does and time is of the essence!

6088
Okay you too jane! Bye!
6091
Oh hey!
6091
Dammit!
6091
What is it now?
6091
In regard to what exactly?
6091
Whose proposal now? Man what are you even prattling about.
6091
You mean making the rabbit for me?
6091
Oh yeah.
6091
Well ive thought about it.
6091
Even went downstairs to check the great vaulty doodad.
6091
And predictably the infernal contraption is nowhere to be found.
6091
I do!
6091
I mean i wouldnt put it in a way like that or come out against a solid policy of clean trousers. But yes adventure is awesome.
6091
I just prefer the idea of adventures which i can actually win.
6091
Well...
6091
I dunno.
6091
It seems it seems it seems!!!
6091
It seems there is a million percent chance that you say it seems way too much and do it just to sound more like a lame robot from a movie and also probably just to piss me off!
6091
And it seems there is a BILLION POINT BILLION percent chance that youre a shitty stubborn jerk of a program who wont listen to reason and that if theres even a 1% chance my REAL LIFE FRIEND would be cool and help me out here then i think i LIKE THOSE FREAKIN ODDS!!!!!
6091
Oh malarkey.
6091
YOU ARE A TIN CAN. ROBOTS DONT HAVE FEELINGS.
6091
Oh.
6091
Um.
6091
Im sorry then if thats the case.
6091
It can just be difficult to drum up sympathy for a program that presents itself as an impostor so often.
6091
Maybe if you werent so ready to insist you were the genuine article all the time? Or didnt make it so confusing for me...
6091
I think it would be best if we henceforth treated you as a totally distinct... uh... THING from my buddy.
6091
And then i could respect your emotional robofeelings and you could respect that sometimes maybe i just want to talk to my bro without a lot of spurious hijinks.
6091
Can we agree to this?
6091
Uh to what?
6091
Oh.
6091
Yeah fine i guess.
6091
Man where IS he anyway???
6091
Is he taking one of his legendary infinite showers?
6091
Frig ok.
6091
Whatever i guess its time to prepare for the thrill of the hunt!
6091
Sigh...
6091
But seriously that brobot has been the bane of my existence ever since you sent it.
6092
Yeah whatever.
6092
I didn't expect it to be nigh impossible to spar with!!!
6092
Yes.
6092
I know.
6092
Ive tried that.
6092
Its just...
6092
Well...
6092
When hes pulling punches...
6092
And taking it all easy and such...
6092
And we start wrestling up a storm and whatnot...
6092
Umm.
6092
Its just that the whole proceeding seems to become...
6092
A bit tender for my liking.
6092
No i know.
6092
Its all fine and dandy martially speaking.
6092
Just the way he...
6092
Sort of...
6092
Man its so awkward trying to convey this just never mind.
6092
No no.
6092
Really never mind!
6092
Oh come on dude.
6092
...
6092
But gosh does your prose ever make a fella feel uncomfortable.
6092
Oh right. My mistake.
6092
Awww maaaan!
6092
But now hell be impossible!
6092
Fuckin.......
6092
SHUCKS buster. :(
6108
Ive barely even begun!
6108
Youre off to a sluggish start then too i gather?
6108
Not exactly.
6108
His stupid doppelglasses have set me on a wild goose chase to go pry his dumb robots chest open and swipe its uranium.
6108
No shit.
6108
I think id rather deal with the monsters.
6108
I know right???
6108
Dont do it jane its a trap!!!
6108
Hell no. I spent so much time haggling with those confounded shades im only leaving my room just now.
6108
Oh yeah!
6108
I was curious about that. Tell me everything and make it snappy!
6108
*Whips up bucket of freshly popped corn.*
6108
Well shoot.
6108
Ok then lay it on me jane.
6109
Oh. Wouldnt it be prospits moon?
6109
That was skaia!
6109
Haha i WISH.
6109
I have received reports from jade about this as well. She liked to talk about her dreams on prospits moon a lot.
6109
No but why would she? This was long before we were born! She was dreaming there like a hundred years ago or something.
6110
Yeah those are prospitians.
6110
They have these hard carapace shells and also have something to do with chess i think?
6110
Like...
6110
Sad?
6110
Hey.
6110
Jane you said i was in this dream. Where do i come in?
6114
The page?
6114
Whos that?
6116
Oh.
6116
Drat.
6116
Are you sure?
6117
Haha yeah. I see your point.
6117
Roger that janey!
6117
And um same goes for you about being careful what with these various rogues accosting you with foul play lately and whatnot...
6117
Because well i sure do care a lot about you too you know that.
6117
Booyeah!
6117
Ok good luck jane and keep me posted! C ya.
6125
Heh heh.
6125
Howdy!
6125
What is all this commotion about?
6125
Ah ok then. Hello it is!
6125
Im not really abreast of the raddest jargon that the cool kids toss about these days.
6125
Maybe because i live alone on an island? I dont know but in any case are you referring to my upcoming birthday?
6125
I see. Very thoughtful of you to consider so early!
6125
I dont wager i could advise with much specificity but i can all but assure you i will find any gesture of yours to be totally capital!
6125
Um... *wrings at kerchief with perspiring mitts*
6125
Yes?
6125
I do want to know what you think!
6125
I always want to know. Because you are always smart and sassy.
6125
Should what now?
6125
Why not?
6125
Well...
6125
Whore bibles notwithstanding i have it on terrific authority that playing this game will be incredibly important!
6125
So perhaps youre right maybe we are part of her evil plan? But does that also necessarily rule out that good will come of it?
6125
Agreed. :D
6125
Intinerwhosit?
6125
Oh. Is there such an itinerary?
6125
Where are you getting this intel? Did you guys make a plan or something?
6125
Ooh, these illicit hacked warez which i heartell were recently jimmied piping hot off the interclouds?
6125
The silicon pickpocket strikes again!!! Whom is the wiser? Nobody.
6125
Yeah?
6125
What?
6125
!!!!!?
6125
Uh...
6125
Hogswallop! Why would you even think that?
6125
Thats so stupid.
6126
Fair enough. When i get back from my errand ill situate myself at the trusty old husktop. Acceptable?
6126
Then you have decided to play in spite of your reservations?
6126
Bravo!
6126
Of course i do.
6126
What sort of friend would i be if not?
6126
She has her ways. I believe they are not incongruous with those of an intelligent and discerning young woman.
6126
Heh. I guess.
6126
Right o! If a man believes hard enough in imaginary things then i dare say that makes them slightly less fake!
6126
It is?
6126
Talk about what?
6126
You mean how um...
6126
Well a way in which i suppose...
6126
Jane is prone to looking upon me with what i fathom to be more than just friendly affection?
6126
Its a tricky issue. And you know i adore jane and please dont think i havent given some thought to...
6126
Well that angle on our relationship i guess.
6126
Oh. Yeah i can see the dilemma this causes for your friendship with her.
6126
Ill drop it.
6126
Haha oh my.
6126
Nothing is escaping that lovely ladys whistlemaker! Its shut tight as a drum!!
6126
Whoa wait i hope that didnt sound dirty...
6126
Ok but may i say this?
6126
If in the future i would like to bring up certain topics completely unsolicited by one who may be sworn to secrecy on those very matters...
6126
And im in need of i guess neutral and totally non compromising advice from a friend do you think that miss zuipperpips might unseal those scandalous metal choppers for a bit?
6126
Fuck that also sounded kinda dirty!!! God dammit.
6126
Wait what?
6126
Oh. Im sure it is but i dunno how much crying im going to be doing...
6126
Probably none i think.
6126
Great!
6126
Yeaaaah...
6126
Well.
6126
Like i said the whole thing is complicated. Best not to get into it all until im ready to you know...
6126
Really start manhandling these bushel loads of prickly pears.
6126
The pears being the tricky subjects in question.
6126
Metaphorically.
6126
Nah its cool.
6126
Sigh...
6126
Yes.
6126
Oh most certainly.
6126
I was actually just getting all of my final affairs in order when you messaged me.
6126
I was to bequeath to you all my WAB posters.
6126
Weekend at bernies dammit!!!!!!
6126
:(
6126
I still dont really get the wiggling thing but no what?
6126
Wow...
6126
Thanks i think???
6474
Bro.
6475
Your contraption and its busy fists just royally kicked my ass.
6475
And that sure as god made little green apples isnt all there is to say on the matter!
6476
Are you listening my friend???
6476
Ill have you know my ass was straightup served ice cold.
6476
My savaged caboose has been catered to impeccably.
6476
Not unlike that of a gentleman stranded on an island inhabited by a race of indigenous butlers.
6476
I hope the far fetched scenario i have described has adequately communicated the severity of my robotic buttwhoopin!
6476
Does this mean i passed the test or whatever the fuck.
6476
Can your robot drop the bullshit and give me the uranium now or what?
6476
Dirk???
6476
Where the frig are you?
6476
Aw nuts.
6486
I still cant find dirk all i get is his jerkwad shades.
6486
Surprise sur freakin prise.
6486
Oh.
6486
No?
6486
I cant see that actually.
6486
Just seeing if you had heard from him yet.
6486
I would really like to speak with him today.
6486
You know like actually in person instead of through his aggravating liaison who is so far up his own ass with this hal 9000 schtick its ridonkulous.
6486
Is he avoiding me or something?
6486
I hope i didnt piss him off through some indiscernible slight. Gosh he can be sensitive.
6486
Huh.
6486
Well okey doke.
6486
Man i just had a crazy dream after getting coldcocked by his roughhouse droid.
6486
What?
6486
Well i dont want to alarm you or anything...
6486
But it may just have featured none other than THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS????????
6486
She had sharp funny horns and a nice blue dress and she may have been some sort of spidery vampire? I dunno. It was very brief but she waved to me.
6486
What wont?
6486
The jakestakes?
6486
Also who said she was an alien? I just thought she was some kind of pretty monster.
6486
Ok i mean this is a strange reaction roxy but ok.
6486
She was a figment of my imagination so what choice do i even have?
6486
About anything? Yes i do imagine our last chat could fit that description.
6486
Not really.
6486
On what?
6486
Sure.
6486
But what are you talking about?
6486
Should i expect a serious exchange about feelings and whatnot?
6486
Wait would this be about certain unrequited pinings you may have alluded to earlier?
6486
Indubitably. Miss zipper lips was it? Humorously misspelled of course.
6486
I guess i cant help but wonder if that truly is the way she sees me or if it is just some wild ego stroking delusion on my part.
6486
I always get this sense that people sorta fancy me but who knows i could be just miles off the old rocker about that!
6486
Youre right i think its high time we cleared the air on some things even if there is a chance it gets all awkward and prickly.
6486
That is what being brave and adventurous is all about after all. It isnt just about summoning the courage to pilfer some priceless loot from trap laden catacomb. Or shooting at stuff with two guns at once.
6486
There are treacheries of the heart to consider!!!
6486
Are you in danger?
6486
Hmm.
6487
Aloha madame.
6487
Yes i have heard that maybe your correspondence was forthcoming.
6487
I just got off the horn with roxy.
6487
Well. Not anything all that specific.
6487
Oh you know how it is. What with her ways.
6487
You know... ways!
6487
I believe they are not incongruous with those of a feisty and provocative young woman.
6487
No its really not like that!
6487
Hold on...
6487
God dammit.
6487
Its just dirks inscrutable wrestlebot acting up over there.
6487
What the fuck is it doing now?
6487
If by causing trouble you mean clobbering the everfriggin tar out of me while still switched to the "novice" setting then yes.
6487
But that is not why i messaged you!!! I will not be deterred here jane.
6487
Jane i think its time we had an honest to goodness dame to fella talk. Like about our...
6487
Stuff. You know?
6487
Our feelings.
6487
Like how we feel about each other.
6487
I dont think im out of line in suggesting weve been tiptoeing around some things here do you?
6487
I think so. Its just a hunch.
6487
Absolutely!
6487
I feel that total honesty between us will be the best policy as we begin our journey together.
6487
So i say lets put all the facts on the table where we can both see them.
6487
With that in mind i would like to ask you a question jane and i hope it doesnt strike you as being too forward.
6487
Maybe its just my imagination but ive picked up on certain lets say hints.
6487
So i have to just come out and ask. Hoo boy this is actually proving to be a serious challenge to my bravery now that im going through with it.
6487
Im getting a little hot under the collar here!
6487
Ok then.
6487
What id like to know is...
6487
Do you like me jane?
6487
I mean do you like me as more than a friend?
6487
Do you envision us as like...
6487
An item? A romantic pairing of sorts?
6487
Is that the direction in which you would prefer our relationship to progress?
6487
Please! Be honest with me jane.
6487
Just come out and say it. Do you fancy me?
6488
I see.
6488
Very well then.
6488
Jeez i mustve really misread that one! I feel like kind of a bone head now.
6488
Are you sure the answers no?
6488
Yes fair enough.
6488
I guess i did put you on the spot there didnt i.
6488
You know it may sound cocky of me but i really was not prepared for this answer!
6488
You must think im just this epic friggin tool now. Couldnt say id disagree if you did.
6488
Now jane lets not backpedal here.
6488
Youve spoken the truth and i greatly appreciate and respect you for that.
6488
But now that i think about it you know what?
6488
Please dont take this the wrong way but your answer is actually kind of a relief!
6488
I consider you to be a lovely lady of the highest caliber and i really think any gent worth his salt would be a huge bozo to let the chance to go steady with you slip through his fingers.
6488
Ive even given the possibility some thought myself.
6488
Sure im only human jane im going to entertain lets say certain ideas. What ifs. You know?
6488
Like what if we did meet up some day? And you asked me out or something. Im sure id say yes given all weve been through together and then well who knows?
6488
Probably but im kind of babbling here. The point is those are all just silly daydreams about stuff and about your feelings for me that i was projecting on you which werent even real.
6488
And now that weve been honest with each other about this we can kind of move on and just be great friends.
6488
And its a load off to be honest because that was lot to think about on top of everything else!
6488
Things are kind of complicated for me jane. With you and roxy and dirk and his crazy responder and now...
6488
Well its a tangled web lets just put it that way.
6488
There are a fuckload of irons in the fire jane!
6488
So many irons in the fire. Such a tangled web. It is a web full of flaming irons.
6488
Exactly. See? You get it.
6488
Oh son of a bitch!
6488
The robot is being weird again.
6489
Its having some sort of mental episode.
6489
See this is what im talking about jane. This is what im dealing with here.
6489
Sigh. Like i said my life is many different hells of complicated.
6489
Youre right. I did say honesty was the best policy didnt i so i might as well not keep certain things so close to the vest anymore.
6489
Actually since youve made your feelings apparent and only see me as a friend that makes it a lot easier!
6489
Maybe you could help me sort out some stuff that has been weighing on me lately?
6489
Jane are you alright?
6489
You seem to be exclaiming more liberally than usual.
6489
Thats aces. Jane youre a sweetheart.
6489
So as i was saying.
6489
I cant help but feel like all this stuff going on with dirk like his responders mind games and his brobots mysterious and brutal hazings...
6489
Are all like...
6489
Man i know this is going to sound crazy.
6489
Like theyre all part of a really long term and esoteric courtship process that is bizarre but somehow makes perfect sense in his mind.
6489
Yes from dirk.
6489
To you know...
6489
Woo me.
6489
I know its hard to believe but i know dirk pretty well and...
6489
Well im more than a little sure he likes me in that way if you catch my drift.
6489
And what with how he is...
6489
Just so relentless and aggressive about everything you know?
6489
So i just start to wonder deep down if maybe its inevitable.
6489
Him and me. As more than just best buddies.
6489
I know if he has his heart set on something he will never let up.
6489
So maybe its just going to happen and things will be easier that way and i should just try to come to terms with it?
6489
Yeah.
6489
Um.
6489
Like i said jane i am inclined to entertain certain ideas and what ifs thats all.
6489
I mean we do get along really well and share a lot of interests.
6489
Im not saying im really GUNG HO TO THE MAX about the proposition but yeah ive given it some thought.
6489
I dunno.
6489
Do you think thats weird of me? For even considering it?
6489
Really?
6489
What jane?
6490
Thats really swell of you to say that.
6490
Have i mentioned what a top notch friend you are jane?
6490
Now please dont take me as saying im about to go leaping into his arms or anything.
6490
That would be a bit brash.
6490
Haha could you imagine??
6490
But my thought process sort of went like this.
6490
Hes been my best friend forever and ive always liked him a lot as a bro.
6490
And years ago i used to joke around with him that we would probably be totally into each other if he was a girl.
6490
But of course that was before i started to realize he was probably serious about those feelings for me regardless.
6490
Heheh come to think of it maybe that was unwittingly poor form on my part kind of leading him on or something?
6490
But then...
6490
Later i started thinking.
6490
Maybe i was being kind of unfair to him in the first place?
6490
I mean by saying we would be a good match only if he was a girl.
6490
Like is that last condition there really all THAT important?
6490
Does that make sense?
6491
You are incredibly understanding jane. Thank you so much for listening.
6491
I have never told anyone all that. Its so great to have a friend as good as you.
6491
If we hadnt cleared the air just now i probably never would have had the gumption to talk about it with you.
6491
Its so cool how you were honest with me about how you felt. I think honesty is always the best policy. I cant believe how much i was overcomplicating all this in my head.
6491
Haha the situation is really pretty funny when you think about it.
6492
Um...
6492
Well...
6492
He basically sent me that thing as kind of a sparring partner.
6492
Like to wrestle with.
6492
And i love to wrestle!
6492
And yeah i guess he programmed it to be a bit overzealous but i mean what do you expect from the guy.
6492
I think its his way of training me to become tougher.
6492
Which sometimes is annoying and sometimes when i walk through the jungle im sweating bullets wondering if its going to pounce on me outta nowhere.
6492
But theres actually something kind of exciting about that its like every day is more of an adventure.
6492
And truthfully its probably working i probably AM getting better at being in scrums.
6492
And his responder which i guess is really a part of his personality even if he doesnt like to say so...
6492
It kind of lets on a lot more than dirk ever would. Its almost like its this weird clone of himself playing passive aggressive matchmaker between me and his real self.
6492
What?
6493
You really think so?
6493
Well i was kinda going to let it play out and just see what happens and go from there...
6493
But you think a more proactive approach would be better?
6493
Wow.
6493
I must say this sort of advice surprises me coming from you!
6493
Hmm.
6493
Yes i guess that is a certainly a strategy to consider.
6493
Jane i must say your perspective on this is refreshingly bold.
6493
Hehehe! Sure looks that way!
6493
Whoa now!
6493
Jane the decision to sire children with your best bro is not one to be taken lightly.
6723
Ahoy!
6723
Jane? Yoo hoo.
6723
No dice?
6723
Okey doke then i just wanted to see what was up with you.
6723
I figured you must be starting up the game by now? Cant wait to get the scoop!
6723
I just had a lets say encounter with dirks dumb robot and well its over now lets just leave it at that.
6723
Headed into the ruins now to seal the deal with this rabbit malarkey finally. Then i can join you!
6723
Not a moment too soon probably. I think this volcano is about to blow?
6723
Its making me mighty nervous im not going to lie.
6723
The grounds been shaking and everything.
6723
Wup!
6723
There it goes again aw frig this is a big one.
6723
Ohhhh shit.
6744
Whoa nelly!
6744
You are too kind my friend. What is it?
6744
I think i catch your drift.
6744
So my new tin comrade finally gets a head on his shoulders eh?
6745
Oh hell no. HELL no man.
6745
Well listen. If youre going to send anything to me slime or otherwise can you please at least not make the shit appear directly over my head this time?
6745
The last thing i need on my bday is another installment of and i quote manbro bukkake theater.
6745
Not really? Its your friggin figure of speech man. I gathered it just meant getting slimed like in ghost busters or somesuch.
6745
Yeah yeah. Im a busy fella dirk!
6745
Wikipedia is a lot of letters to type in a thing for a man of action on the go.
6745
Im always doing adventures remember?
6745
Well yes. But ok i have a LOT of movies to bone up on. There are so many good ones i still havent seen.
6745
Screw you i have IMPECCABLE standards! Its just theres so much good stuff out there and ive really been on a roll with my picks lately.
6745
Yes i hear myself just fine.
6745
I hear a discriminating gentlemans melodious voice and it strikes my ears as the voice of reason! Heheh.
6745
Say heres one im pretty excited about. Have you heard about this avatar jam? Its coming out next year.
6745
No man it is not blue furry shit far from it. Get this. It is about this paralyzed fellow who is down on his luck and longs for adventure. And he finds it!
6745
But it is far away on an enchanted planet rich with coveted treasures. And adventure is not all that he finds oh no. He also finds romance.
6745
A beautiful blue woman from the wild teaches him the ways of her savage culture and also the ways of alien love. Together they frolic in the forest whilst sharing primal intimacy through magic sexual escapades.
6745
Whats so funny wise guy?
6745
Excuse me but i fail to see what could possibly be gay about some huge elegant blue men and women having really spiritual intercourse with their tails or something.
6745
But youre from friggin texas! Arent you?
6745
Augh stop being such a cryptic troll all the time!
6745
Anyway avatar looks spectacular and i think my preemptive review was spot on. The bloody end!
6745
You are just treating my great taste in flicks to your aloof hipstery disdain as usual. You dont know anything about that movie. Maybe youll like it?
6745
Well now i know youre just trolling me. It wont be out for another year!
6745
Alrighty.
6745
I hope it wont be as difficult to finish building as the rest was to assemble.
6745
Capital!
6745
Scoot that noggin my way at your ready then.
6746
Hehe. You nerd.
6746
Hes got your slick japanese spectacles and everything.
6746
Why is this a metal man before me or is it none other than dirk strider himself in my room??
6746
It almost sounds like this is something youve given some thought...
6746
Affirmative.
6746
I continue to boggle vacantly at your technical shenanigans.
6746
Your knack for gadgetry seems to surpass even my grandmas and she was like this big time gizmo legend.
6746
How do you even do this stuff?
6746
If you say so buddy. I can believe it.
6746
Yeah but come on its not like youre from a century in the future.
6746
Nor am i a quaint man of the past. Pardon me but do i SOUND like some trollycar bellwether toiling in the heart of the mustache belt from the ruff n tumble year of nineteen aught nine???
6746
Give me some credit man and some to yourself as well. You are too modest about all this robotics noise.
6746
The kitchen?
6746
Oh of course!
6746
Fire is quite notoriously the hottest thing there is. A tip top locale for a whole mess of irons!
6746
See again i think you are downplaying a pretty neat accomplishment if you ask me.
6746
Does that mean I'll have to deal with two dirks?
6746
One who is MORE MACHINE THAN MAN...
6746
And another who is a computer program you made hahahahahahaha.
6746
Id wager a tidy sum the results of the endeavor will be sensational.
6746
I believe in you!
6746
Sure bro. I always have.
6746
You have helped me out a lot and been a good friend for ages.
6746
What?
6746
Why not what?
6746
Whoa uh...
6746
Dirk are you... uh...
6746
Saying what i think?
6746
Uh never mind sorry for interrupting.
6746
Should i sit down for this i dont know what to do.
6746
Wait i already am sitting down. Maybe i should stand up?
6746
Ummmmmmmm.
6746
Maybe?
6746
I think i need a towel or something.
6746
Oh!
6746
Oh. Yes.
6746
I think so.
6746
What? Oh man are you actually serious??
6746
So like...
6746
You ARE from a century in the future.
6746
WOW.
6746
I must say this is not the announcement i was expecting.
6746
So you are a time traveler from 2422 here to help me build robots or something?
6746
How?
6746
Wait... you and roxy?
6746
Holy fucking mackerel. This is amazing!
6746
Well yeah. Sure man why not? Wait its not a prank is it?!
6746
Then heck yes i believe it to friggin pieces. Its an awesome thing to be true!
6746
So whats the far flung future like? Some sort of crazy robo paradise?
6746
Oh man what are your movies like in the future?? I bet there are some real cinematic humdingers. Like holographic stuff? Or shit you plug directly into your brain pod right? Wait you do have brain pods right?
6746
Well shit.
6746
Dirk this story got so much less awesome.
6746
Is it too late to backpedal on believing it before i start to cry?
6746
Sure do.
6746
Lemme just finish putting this steel melon on my brobot and then im all ears...
6747
There he is finished.
6747
Look at this spanking iron friend from the future. He is perfect.
6747
Oh shoot dirk he just got blurry and disappeared! What the actual fuck?
6747
Stalking mode??
6747
What? Thats crazy why would i want that!
6747
Well yeah but... man.
6747
I guess youre right.
6747
I was just picturing a little good honest rough housing... why does the whole thing have to sound so sketchy and nerve wracking!
6747
Yes!
6747
Youre right lets put issues of fisticuffs aside for now. Tell me everything about the future.
6747
So how does humanity fuck up? Is it the nuclear holocaust? Or is it robots? Gotta be the robots right? As per the terminator.
6747
Oh the old alien overlord story? Got it. When does she show up?
6747
Jeez that is pretty scary. So in a few years she will be in charge of everything?
6747
My grandma?
6747
I do remember when i was very young she would tell me stories of the wicked woman who raised her.
6747
Was she the evil alien?
6748
They were the rebels you mentioned? Are they alive right now?
6748
I mean in my time?
6748
Oh! I am very curious about them and also my grandma.
6748
What happened to them?
6749
Wait... these beasts tend to the young??
6749
I can tell you from first hand experience that monsters are totally rotten at taking care of kids!
6749
They do a bangup job of making em scared though. :(
6749
So does that mean you and rox were raised by these things?
6750
Damn.
6750
Wait...
6750
Flooding?
6750
Wow like the epic kevin costner film?
6750
Oh man does that mean you have to drink your own pee??????
6750
Ewwwwwwwwwwww no dude. No ew. :(
6750
Oh ok. Whew.
6750
I guess your lusis droid thingy sees to it that you have fresh water?
6750
Oh i thought...
6750
Hm. Well who raised you then?
6750
!
6750
Jesus christofer kringlefucker and here i thought i was rugged!
6750
Thats true.
6750
Heaven forbid.
6750
And what about roxy?
6751
Wait the whatsits?
6751
Are they aliens too?
6752
Good gravy. Those are exotic circumstances!
6752
And here i was thinking i had the most exciting and adventurous life. It turns out im just some chump on boring ass monster island in the silly old PRE apocalypse.
6752
Youre probably right.
6752
Id be really keen on talking to roxy about this too!
6752
Im very curious about her experiences as a future lady with all the whatsits. The hard shell folk.
6752
I must say it turns my previous perception of your lives right on its friggin ear.
6752
Like what is even your day to day business like in sea hitlers water apocalypse??
6753
Those are amazing stories. I am so lucky to have friends like you.
6753
Oh snap what about jane! Have you told her?
6753
Hmm. True but it seems a shame to keep her out of the loop.
6753
Okay.
6753
Wow i still have so many questions.
6753
Its incredible that this is all going to happen right around the corner! I dunno if im ready...
6753
I want to join the opposition!
6753
Fuck this witch i have lots of guns and reckless bravado and i want to stop her. Ill pick up where my grandma left off!
6753
Horse shit why not?!
6754
Heck yes bro.
6754
My memory of her is pretty foggy.
6754
I do know she loved adventure just like me. Thats why she was exploring this island and raising me here when she died.
6754
She was a fair markswoman and knew her way around an atom or two.
6754
Pretty sure her company made a tidy fortune til it went belly up. At least i still have a few of her knickknacks for keepsakes.
6754
And as you confirmed she was raised by that evil spinster.
6754
But then again from some of the things my pen pal has said it kind of throws some of these details into question so i dunno what to think.
6754
It was the night i found her dead!
6755
She had gone off to study the ruins one day. Im pretty sure that was her purpose on this island. To study the technology here and solve all of the astonishing mysteries.
6755
She even built that big fancy house we used to live in so i guess she really wanted to settle here for a while.
6755
But she didnt come home from her expedition for a couple days so i started to get worried.
6755
I followed the trail we usually take to the lagoon while keeping my eyes peeled for monsters.
6755
But instead i found her lying there dead.
6755
I think a monster caught her off guard. There were three big fang marks in the body and a trail of blood along the path.
6755
It looked like she was trying to get home but couldnt make it before succumbing to the injury.
6755
But before i could even do anything about it i heard an explosion. I looked back at the hill and my house was gone!
6756
Just a big poof of smoke where it was standing. So i lived alone in the jungle ever since.
6756
Well you never asked!
6756
Indeed.
6756
No?
6757
Oh theres not much more to it. I had to deal with grandmas body.
6757
I would have loved to give her a proper and dignified memorial like janes granddad got.
6757
God jane is so lucky every day in her household must be like weekend at bernies! What a riot it must be im so jealous.
6757
I know right!!!
6757
Alas i had to dispose of the body with haste so the monsters wouldnt eat her.
6757
So i just made a little camp fire and burned it. I keep the ashes deep in the ruins which is where i think she liked it best.
6757
Hopefully there isnt an earthquake or something that would knock the urn over in a predictable and hilarious fashion.
6757
Heheh yeah.
6757
So then after camping out the next day i went exploring and found my room globe mostly intact sitting in the jungle so thats where i lived since.
6757
And thats pretty much it!
6757
I sure miss my grandma though she was the best.
6757
What did you hear?
6758
Yes i vaguely remember her mentioning him.
6758
Cripes the things she told me now that i think about it. She said the witch even killed her dog!
6758
Is that true?
6758
So what youre saying is pretty much any unspeakably horrible thing she could have done she probably did?
6758
Haha wow. Must have been a hell of a guy.
6758
Where? Huh?
6758
What are you talking about! Dirk stop speaking in riddles and keep telling the story i am on tenterhooks here!
6758
Oh my god you can be one opaque motherfucker just clue me in bro!
6758
STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!
6759
Oh! I remember this.
6759
I believe she said the witch used to be married to a terrible man named english.
6759
So because the witch really hated that guy she took on his name as sort of a big ole fuck you to the woman?
6759
So im named after a demon? What kind of demon is named english anyway?
6759
I guess its kind of cool being named after a demon whos so scary even the witch is afraid of him.
6759
I love skulls!
6760
These are your ancestors?
6760
Anyone ive heard of?
6760
Oh sure obviously.
6760
Gadzooks of course!!!
6760
With all your future mindfuckery you made me completely forget about your vaunted hollywood sibling.
6760
I shoulda asked where he fit into the picture if you were raised alone. I can be dumb as a bag of penny candy sometimes.
6760
Whoa now those are the sweets kept in reserve for millionaires. Such flattery!
6760
Right. So then he was never actually your bro?
6760
The lady who wrote all the dreary wizard books i presume?
6761
No i tried its too depressing. And also uh kind of impossible to understand?
6761
I told roxy i liked it though i didnt want to hurt her feelings so dont say i said that.
6761
I think ill wait for the movies to come out i bet ill like those better.
6761
I do say! Hey you mustve seen them what being in the future are they any good?
6761
Phooey to that. Like i even believe you!
6762
Fuck yes the sbahj films RULE.
6762
Screw the haters! Thats what i say.
6762
Man that is a scandalous mischaracterization. Nobody hates weekend at bernies!
6762
The WAB films are generally regarded as so unremarkably mediocre they dont even attract any trolls who care enough to shit on it. Believe me ive tried to get in debates with people about it!
6762
Dang i can hardly wait to see them!
6762
Why not?
6762
!!!!!!!!!
6762
I will guard each glistening compression artifact with my life, as if a jewel pilfered from a tomb.
6762
Well there was sbahj the movovie and sbahj the the film...
6762
Oh yeah and sbahaj the movle. I think sbahj the moive is still in production right?
6762
But honestly i get confused about which particular misspelling is attributed to which film or even if im getting the misspellings right.
6763
Your forebears are certainly entrepreneurial if nothing else.
6763
I can get behind the idea of making a killing if it means i also get to be as good at doing adventures as i hope to be.
6763
Did they ever bring the battle to the witchs doorstep or were the blows dealt strictly through public masquerades and theatrics?
6763
Powers you say?
6763
How?
6763
So...
6763
They knew you would show up in the future some day and prepared for that...
6763
Doesn't that mean they also knew they weren't going to be able to stop the witch?
6763
Wow.
6763
Thats brave and kind of sad.
6763
Of course!!!!!
6763
You always go down guns blazing. Thats what a hero does when he loves adventure and has guns.
6763
If theres one thing movies have taught me besides the fact that guys using a corpse as a silly puppet is friggin HILARIOUS it is THAT FACT.
6763
Who?
6763
Eugh! Just the thought of such scoundrels turns my stomach!
6764
Dang.
6764
I would like to think i will not be suckered by their silvery tongues whenever they come along.
6764
Who!
6764
No?
6764
I dont think so.
6765
That boorish cur!!!
6765
How could such an atrocity be allowed to happen?
6765
Was his personal magnetism really that overwhelming?
6765
Oh no.
6765
When does that happen?
6765
So like...
6765
They were on the ticket together? As president and vice president?
6765
They did? Warned us about what exactly?
6765
Im not sure i follow. These are like clown presidents or such?
6765
Dirk i really dislike the future you are describing.
6766
I still dont really know what a juggalo is.
6766
Do they juggle?
6773
Heavens to betsy.
6773
That figure is just absurd.
6773
Whoa momma.
6774
Yeah i know the feeling. :(
6774
Wait...
6774
Dirk didnt you tell me at some point that you did find evidence the witch killed them?
6774
Are you sure? I SWEAR i remember you saying something about that.
6774
Oh.
6774
I am just having the NUTTIEST deja vu thing going on now. I feel weird.
6774
I guess i am mistaken. Never mind.
6775
Right. Good plan.
6775
Um.
6775
Anyhoo thats a heck of a tragic and thrilling tale dirk.
6775
I am still totally cockeyed and catawampus about it all i dont even know what to think.
6775
Oh yeah every word of it!
6775
Why shouldnt i? You are my friend and i trust you.
6775
Heh not really i just like believing stuff and believing in people.
6775
Wait what do you mean?
6775
When you said after all this time?
6775
You just told me now!
6775
Hang on.
6775
Blarg! The deja vuey shit is happening again!!!
6775
Okay i am SURE weve had this conversation before so many things are familiar.
6775
I remember you saying the one of a kind dude thing and i remember saying the word catawampus and...
6775
All of it!
6775
Whats going on?
6775
Figure what out!
6775
Oh.
6775
Thats right. I fell off the platform thing and i guess i got knocked out?
6775
So im dreaming.
6775
Whats that?
6775
So we are sharing a dream together?
6775
And youre currently asleep too? Uh. Currently in the future?
6775
Hm. I guess i understand?
6775
So whats the deal then? Wait.
6775
You said this is where they meet dead people too...
6775
Shit! Dirk are you dead? Are you a ghost!?
6775
Then what the fuck is going on! Who am i talking to?
6775
What? Uh...
6775
I dont know?
6775
Okay.
6775
So.
6775
I am having like a lucid dreamy thing in a magic bubble and you are just like a figment of my imagination?
6775
So im talking to myself! Thats kind of stupid!
6775
Just how startlingly close are we talking?
6775
Okay thats fair.
6775
But.
6775
Man.
6775
There is something that feels kind of weird about this. You being in my head... its a little messed up!
6775
Ok im sorry for saying its messed up but...
6775
Its still a bit frustrating! Ive been trying to talk to you all day.
6775
But all i get is your pesky responder bedeviling me at every turn and your friggin robot punching me across the ocean and then throwing a weird tantrum and ripping his nuclear heart out in front of me.
6775
And if that werent enough i tumbled off the doohickey and knocked myself out and now im strolling down memory lane with your fake brain ghost!
6775
Its like you are surrounding me from all sides with imitations of yourself but never the REAL YOU!!!
6775
Cheese and fucking crackers when do i just get to talk to the actual dirk?
6775
What a horseshitty question!
6775
I dont know anything about actuality i guess but i know some philosobabble horseshit when i dadblasted hear it.
6775
But what does that mean?
6775
And how can you really be made of only my thoughts when i dont even know what youre talking about sometimes?
6775
Or when i didnt know some of the things youre telling me? Like about being in a dream bubble?
6775
How can i tell myself about that stuff through brain ghost dirk!
6775
I dont think i do!
6775
I have no business knowing those things.
6776
Are you sure you arent real?
6776
No offense but I kind of get the same smartass vibe from you as i do from the responder.
6776
Like har har i have the same basic personality as dirk but without any accountability or anything so let me just be kind of flippant and mess with this jake fellas head!
6776
You know what im saying?
6776
Yeah see i think i maybe did a little TOO good of a job brain cloning you? This is way too much like talking to the REAL fake dirk.
6776
Holy cow what a dumb sentence that was.
6776
Well thats just spiffy for me but im starting to feel somewhat like im being haunted by you now.
6776
I just want to talk to my real buddy. And by real i just mean the ORIGINAL GUY.
6776
Oh i dont know.
6776
Aaah! No dont say that its so weird.
6776
Yes. I know.
6776
With you? No!! Thats like...
6776
Thats like talking to him about it which is like really jumping the gun i think.
6776
But i cant yet! I just cant.
6776
There are some feelings im not sure how to put into words yet and doing it in front of you whether youre a stunt double or brain puppet or whatever it just makes me feel uncomfortable!
6776
Yes.
6776
What is so hard to understand about that?
6776
Huh?
6776
Oh yeah.
6776
What about her?
6776
Man what?
6776
Thats dumb i saw her for three seconds and she waved at me and i woke up!
6776
Why do you keep calling her a ghost??
6776
Oh. Well.
6776
Holy shit?
6776
No i wont.
6776
What? What about jane?
6776
Our last chat ended on very pleasant and amicable terms! She was upbeat and chipper as ever. I fail to see what reason one might have to feel sorry for her.
6776
Wait... didnt i?
6776
What are you getting at!
6776
Jane?!
6776
Whoa.......
6776
Whoa ok.
6776
Where? Wait. She is??
6776
Oh fuck.
6776
Screw you!!!
6776
I am cool as SUCH a cucumber.
6776
Uh.
6776
Why does my breath not smell ok?
6776
Oh okay whew.
6776
When is she coming? Why is she visiting my dreams?
6776
Alright...
6776
Dang! Its warm in this dream bubble. How can i be sweating in a dream??
6776
Where do i keep the dream towels...
6776
But really who is she? Whats her deal and what does she want from me?
6776
Since all this so called untapped potential in my subconscious taking the form of yet another sassy dirk clone seems to know everything would it be ok if i troubled my own brain for a few flipping answers???
6776
Augh no no no im sorry im sorry dont!
6776
Okay. Thank you for promising to keep my trousers tidy.
6776
I still dont understand how you know... or excuse me MY BRAIN knows this stuff. Because im a page? How does that make sense?
6776
And also if you know the things she will say why dont you just tell me the things?
6777
Ok dude shes here shoosh!
6777
Oh man. Ummmm...
6777
Okay i will i will youre distracting me though! Can you scoot over a bit?
6777
Hi there! Welcome! Er...
6777
Dont mind him hes just a brain clone of my best friend. I know that sounds crazy. Heh.
6777
Wait she cant? Why didnt you tell me that!!! You are really throwing me off here.
6777
I thought you were supposed to know stuff like that seeing as you are LITERALLY MY BRAIN!
6777
How can i chillax when you keep talking to me its really disconcerting!!!!!
6777
Shhhh just SHUT UP i cant THINK!
6777
OH GOD NO DONT YOU DARE!!!!!!!!!
6777
NO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ME A BONER DIRK!!!
6777
SO THAT WAS THE PLAN ALL ALONG???
6777
TO GIVE ME A BONER???
6777
YOU MOTHER FUCKER!
6777
OH...
6777
OH TEE HEE A FALSE ALARM I SEE VERY FUNNY COOL GUY!
6777
I THINK YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT!
6777
YOURE BLUFFING YOU DONT EVEN HAVE THE POWER TO GIVE ME A PHANTASMAL ERECTION!
6777
THEN GO AHEAD! MAKE MY FUCKING DAY!
6777
IM READY FOR YOU. YOU THINK IM AFRAID? ILL TAKE YOUR BONER MAGIC LIKE A MAN!
6777
IM NOT ASHAMED! I WILL STAND TALL AND PROUD AT FULL MAST IN FRONT OF THIS PRETTY ALIEN!
6777
DO YOUR WORST YOU BASTARD!!!!!
6777
WELL GOOD RIDDANCE TO IRONIC HIPSTER DOUCHEWAD RUBBISH IS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT!
6777
WHAT?
6777
I mean... what? Whos jack?
6826
...
6826
Uh...
6826
...
6826
Gulp!
6826
Shit!
6826
Sorry. I dont know where i put the dream towels.
6826
What?
6826
Whoa really?
6826
Like you can see the future?
6826
Are they ghost powers or troll powers? Or wait shucks thats a dumb sounding question.
6826
Invasive?
6826
Uh oh.
6826
Aw man youre kidding!
6826
So much for trying to be cool i guess.
6826
Although i probably blew that when you saw me yelling at nobody about boners and stuff.
6826
That was like...
6826
The brain ghost memory splinter of my best friend dirk who is stuck in my head and you cant see.
6826
And he was kinda hassling me and trying to get me to talk to him about how his real self has a thing for me but i kind of think it would be weird to talk to his brain impostor about that? At least for now.
6826
And then you showed up and you caught me at an awkward moment where he was threatening to make some bodily functions happen in front of you as a joke which would have been embarrassing as all blasted heck.
6826
But now it turns out you can read my mind too so im surrounded by brain invaders!
6826
You seem cool aranea but uh when am i going to wake up?
6826
Ok. I guess thats not too bad.
6826
I think i can keep my feelings buttoned up. That is what strong and adventurous gentlemen do i think. They keep a stiff upper lip even on the inside. That way they are never embarrassed and feel slightly more brave about stuff.
6826
Um gotcha.
6826
But what should i talk about?
6826
My life?
6826
I wish i could say it was more interesting but its actually been a mite lackluster.
6826
There are monsters but i try to stay away from them to tell you the truth.
6826
Its mostly just me sitting around here watching movies and stuff and sometimes polishing firearms.
6826
Guns are sweet. So are movies heh. This is a terrible story.
6826
Show you around my room? Yes ok.
6826
Well. There are some guns. Like i said guns are great.
6826
There is a whole mess of movie posters on the wall. You probably never heard of any of them being a dead alien and such.
6826
And...
6826
I dont know. Theres a desk which i use to work on silly projects. And thats my bed i guess.
6826
Ummmm and...
6826
Hmm what else.
6826
(What? Shh!)
6826
Nothing!
6826
(Go away!!)
6826
(Shhhhh not listening to you.)
6826
Nothing! Its cool. Im...
6826
(No no stop. See youre talking about it and now i cant help it!)
6826
(You are psyching me into having dirty thoughts get fucking lost you interloping brain douche!!!)
6826
(Shut up theyre just thoughts its not even like im trying to have them THEY DONT MEAN ANYTHING!)
6826
No!!!
6827
Oh hey whoa!
6827
Lets not worry about that its nothing really. Here give me that ok?
6827
Hahaha what? No its not that at all its just...
6827
I dunno its just a nerdy comic i read its no big deal.
6827
Theres GOT to be other stuff to talk about lets see...
6827
Huh?
6827
A flushed whatsit!!
6827
Oh my flipping gosh...
6828
Aaaaargh oh god oh god you sensed my stupid sexy thoughts i KNEW it.
6828
God DAMN you bogus brain strider!
6828
Someone needs to just kill me. Or at least make me wake up! This is so humiliating i dont even...
6828
Can you please just slap me really hard? If not in retribution for my ungentlemanly train of thought then at least to just get me to wake up and save me from my own ceaseless buffoonery.
6828
Um... maybe?
6828
Well...
6828
No.
6828
I imagine it would.
6828
So...
6828
Youve sensed it when other fellas have had the hots for you eh?
6828
Yowza!
6828
You mustve been popular i guess.
6828
That is hard to believe.
6828
Ha! Thats a laugh.
6828
I am quite sure my only suitor is my best bro and even then he is such a jumbled stupid puzzle of unfathomable ironies im not even sure about THAT half the time.
6828
I wish i had your powers that would be top notch. Id be parked on the corner of relationship lane and EASY STREET.
6828
I could kick back in my eligible bachelors limousine and never fuck up or ever say anything awkward like i have been doing non stop so far in this dream.
6828
So there are people on your planet who do that?
6828
So you were in a higher caste because of the hemospectrum thing you mentioned?
6828
I heard all of it!
6828
I was just um... well go on.
6828
That is sure a neat sounding science fiction utopia.
6828
Wait duh i mean science reality.
6828
But then it all went to shit because of that meddlesome demon?
6828
The demon you say im supposed to defeat?
6828
Hang on.
6828
Would that be the same demon im named after?
6828
Uh...
6828
I guess technically my own brain did?
6828
Why?
6828
Yeah.
6828
But its true right?
6829
Can you tell me anything more about this demon?
6829
All i know is he might be a skull monster.
6829
Wait he is a skull monster right?
6829
Yessss. Ok but...
6829
I feel like i should know more about him if im supposed to kill him.
6829
Oh...
6829
So... you are saying i could do all this?
6829
Or that i will?
6829
Who?
6829
Ummm.
6829
Nah just some more boring junk.
6829
There are these fanciful branches but i dunno where they came from.
6829
I suspect dream sorcery.
6829
Are they from a wizards memory?
6829
Oh.
6829
Well I guess i could show you around outside.
6829
There is a jungle out there full of tremendous beasts.
6830
Son of a BITCH! More fancy branches.
6830
What is this realm of limitless wonder?
6830
(Sh!)
6830
Its great. Everything is so amazing!
6830
Who would have thunk you could have such crackerjack adventures in your dreams that are basically REAL instead of imaginary?
6830
Or for that matter...
6830
That you could meet such neat people along the way.
6830
(Sh!)
6830
(No sh.)
6830
(Maybe i will wise guy!)
6830
(Yeah i know!!)
6830
(Now shushhhhhhhh.)
6830
Huh?
6830
Yes. Right.
6830
(No!)
6830
(Screw you!)
6830
(You heard her i totally have a shot hehehe!)
6830
*Cough* uh go on.
6830
What to happen?
6830
Yeah right bro did you hear that at least if i kick the bucket early there will be shall i say a silver lining wink wink nudge nudge.
6830
It will take the form of some spooky smooches from a smokin ghostly troll babe so shut your jealous trap!
6830
Wait.
6830
Oh dear.
6830
How uh...
6830
How loud was i talking just then?
6830
Augh!
6830
God.
6830
Ok just.
6830
Pretend to forget that maybe?
6830
Not you! Her!!
6830
Sigh.
6830
Why dont you just tell me where were going.
6831
Ok.
6831
Who is your friend?
6831
Another troll?
6831
Wow.
6831
So she died before she could be the empress i guess?
6831
Why not?
6831
Thats a hell of a long time.
6831
I guess she wasnt into that?
6831
You mean it led to you being dead?
6831
She sounds like a handful.
6831
...
6831
(Heheheh.)
6831
(Ok that was kinda funny.)
6886
(Sh!)
6890

(But thats sea hitler! Shes right there in the spooky flesh!)
6904
(Remember all the horrible things you said she did??)
6904
(Cripes it sets my blood aboil just thinking about it.)
6904
(I have to stop her! Thats why im here i just figured it out. I have to do it bro!)
6904
(Yes i do thats what you do when you go back in time and find hitler.)
6904
(Thats like one of the rules of adventure if you have the chance to kill hitler and stop his crimes from happening then you do it!)
6904
(Oh man oh man oh man...)
6904
(I gotta do something ok ok how do i do this...)

6957
What is the change of plan?
6957
I see. Variables and what not.
6957
Lets cut to the chase! What do i do.
6957
Crucial upgrades huh?
6957
I dunno about crucial buddy i see you have trolled me with like 50 copies of this dumbfuck social media software for cool bros in hats but ok.
6957
Ok i installed it should i run it?
6957
Sure if you say so.
6957
Great caesars ghost! Why didnt you say so.
6957
Ok done.
6957
Hey theres his room!
6958
Heh heh. Id recognize that room anywhere.
6958
Horses puppets holy smokes there is a man who knows what he likes.
6958
But where is he?
6958
I dont see him elsewhere in the place.
6958
Lots of priceless sbahj merch though im so jealous.
6958
What?
6958
Lol!
6958
Just joking bro that sucked.
6958
How do i find dirk and save his life?
6959
Eureka!!!!!
6959
Youre right he sure does look to be in a thorough pickle.
6959
My impulse is to message him now but youre kind of bogarting his chumhandle so i dont even know how to do that?
6959
Ok then how do i help?
6959
I will have them deployed lickety split.
6959
That flaming ocean is nothing to sneeze at.
6959
It is fixing to burn his... uh. Skeletal highrise thing right the heck down.
6959
Oh. Are more robots on the way?
6959
Um...
6959
Oh!
6959
You mean the super deadly red shit?
6960
Say no more.
6960
I understand the threat and will now spring into action guns blazing.
6960
Well maybe not guns blazing.
6960
The guns and how they blaze will be metaphors for my tenacity and gumption as an elite gamer.
6961
There we are. No sweat.
6961
Haha! He did a thumbs up at me.
6961
Hey buddy!
6961
Say hey buddy to him.
6961
Sweet.
6961
Now what?
6961
How long will that take?
6961
Understood. That being as it is in the meantime i think ill poke into one of these transporty doodads.
6962
Whoa what is THIS place?
6962
Things sure are a rumblin here in this enchanted purple palace.
6962
I cant believe i never found those hidden transport pads under the thing.
6962
How did you know about them?
6962
You are so wise. I will never be as elite of a game bro as you.
6962
Will you untwist your virtual knickers. I have everything under control.
6962
I think this may be where my grandma used to go during some of her expeditions.
6962
You dont just pass up the chance for an adventure like this!
6962
We will just see about THAT.
6962
Besides i have my skulltop with me so i can swoop in to assist dirk at any time!
7144
What?????
7144
Dude what is going on...
7144
Is this... is this really dirks head???
7144
What happened to him!
7144
How?!
7144
Uhh.
7144
I dont understand!
7144
Are you saying i have to kiss him... like uh... on the lips... while you stare at me through his sunglasses like a weirdo??
7144
That doesnt make any sense!
7144
Can you actually tell me whats going on?! What happened to him?
7144
So...
7144
If i kiss him his headless body will hop up and start prancing about or...
7144
Will he grow a new head???
7144
But like...
7144
If hes dead in the future...
7144
How does kissing him NOW bring him back? How does that work?
7144
Wait...
7144
Are you behind these shenanigans?
7144
Did you plan this auto responder??????????
7145
Really.
7145
What is it?
7145
Huh?
7145
Why that name...
7145
Thats a lie!
7145
How do you know i wouldnt like it???
7145
Argh!
7145
This strikes me as rather unsportingly manipulative of you mr hal if indeed that IS your real name.
7145
You never answered my question!
7145
Did you plan for this to happen... like for me to be in this situation?
7145
How long have your machinations been in play!
7145
I dont even know what that means!
7145
Little hal... i think youve gone and flipped your FUDGING LID.
7145
Oh and hal is a STUPID NAME!!!!
7145
Augh not that fuckin meme again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7145
Ok ok just...
7145
Gimme a minute!
7145
They?
7145
Whos they?
7145
Oh god! Jane!!!
7145
I forgot what with the bonk to the noggin last i saw she was run right through with a fearsome lash of that red noise.
7145
Is she ok?!
7145
Shes dead???
7145
You mean like DEAD dead????
7145
Everybody??
7145
Even roxy???!!!
7145
So...
7145
Dirk jane roxy... theyre all...
7145
So youre telling me that while i was asleep somehow EVERYBODY died???
7145
I dont know what THAT means either!!!
7145
Whoa wait whoa whoa... our LOVE? Hang on a minute!
7146
Ok im going to! God!!!
7146
I just...
7146
This isnt how i pictured it going.
7146
Between him and me.
7146
There had to be a better way than this!
7146
I guess if it was going to go this way...
7146
I kinda pictured something different?
7146
There was stuff i wanted to say.
7146
To the real him i mean.
7146
Stop being so pushy!
7146
I LOVE adventure and you KNOW it!
7146
ALRIGHT WISE GUY YOU WANT YOUR FLIPPING KISS???
7146
YOU GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7416
SIIIIIGH.
7416
Oh! Hey there buddy i nearly forgot you were bobbing about over there what with my emotional dilemmas.
7416
Heheheh. Was i really so transparent?
7416
Youre a good man mr erisol. A good man with a good heart. Im lucky to have you as a friend.
7416
I suppose its true. You can be a bit of a surly customer.
7416
I dont hold it against you though. You have always been a wonderful source of amusement and companionship in this desolate place.
7416
Sure thing.
7416
Im just not sure who else to talk to about my issues with dirk.
7416
Im so conflicted. Ive enjoyed our time together and all the adventures weve had over the last few months.
7416
But as a paramour he has been overbearing to say the least. I dont know if i have the gumption to withstand another round of needy overtures.
7416
What do you think sir sprite? Should i put the old kibash on the affair?
7416
Although frankly that prospect alone sounds arduous.
7416
I wouldnt even know what to say to the poor fella.
7416
You are my mystical guide on this adventure! What perchance might you advise?
7416
Oh mr erisol. You are in rare form today.
7416
HAHAHAHAHAHA!
7416
STOP! STOP!!! MY SIDES.
7416
Your act is too rich. Thanks buddy this is cheering me up at least a little.
7416
Youre right. I really should catch up with Janey.
7416
Its been a while since we spoke. It does seem like more and more im the one to get in touch with her.
7416
I do hope she hasnt tired too badly of listening to my problems. The last thing i want is to give the impression that everything revolves around my various romantic hurdles.
7416
Ah! There she blows. Your favorite finger of all.
7416
You sure do love showing that one to people. Its actually become a vaguely comforting gesture.
7416
Boy howdy!!!
7421
Greetings!
7421
Im not interrupting anything am i?
7421
Ah i see. I would be happy to message you again later if it would spare you any inconvenience.
7421
Uh.
7421
Forgotten?
7421
Forgotten what now?
7422
Wait dont tell me.
7422
Is it a tomb or a crypt or somesuch? Are you preparing for another grist seeking expedition??
7422
Oh shit did you schedule my assistance for the raid and i forgot all about it???
7422
Blast.
7422
Well what in the name of willy howard tafts great tub choking bottom could i be forgetting then?
7422
This is going to drive me CRAZY! Can you give me a hint?
7422
Of course! Your birthday!!!
7422
Yes thats right. Now i remember. The date sure snuck up on us quick didnt it?
7422
Sorry you know how things can slip my mind. The gourd on my shoulders isnt the steel trap it used to be. Nothing like the well oiled puzzlebuster you've got up there.
7422
Well damn.
7422
Looks like the egg monster took quite the spirited dump on my face this time.
7422
I feel so dumb. Ill be right over.
7422
You baked a cake for your own party?
7422
I dont know something seems amiss about that. Isnt that against tradition or inviting bad luck or something?
7422
But I guess it makes sense since you love baking cakes. Its like a present you give to yourself!
7422
Oh. I just wanted to get your advice on some stuff.
7422
But since ive been a heel and forgotten about your party maybe i shouldnt bother you with that?
7422
So sixteen big ones huh! The ole sweet sixteen.
7422
Last one of us to notch the vaunted one sixer. Its a big step! I knew youd make it, i always said i believed in you didnt i?
7422
Just kidding, the inexorable nature of times passage virtually assured you would get that old so you didnt really have anything to do with it. I mean not that i dont still believe in you, i do.
7423
I cant believe its already been...
7423
How long?
7423
What, like a year already since we entered? Holy moly, where does the time go.
7423
Oh.
7423
Well thats still a pretty long time.
7423
I have to admit its been a longer stint than i expected. Certainly one involving more downtime than i would have guessed.
7423
I really thought we would have been treated to more action, what being legendary players of a mysterious cosmic game. But no, it seems the primary duty of the so called nobles is to wait around twiddling our thumbs.
7423
I am really beginning to wonder when these fabled heroes will arrive? And are they really going to be those we have been led to believe?
7423
I sure hope so. Id so love to meet my pen pal. Dear old departed grandma. But as a feisty youngster! What a hoot thatll be. And you with your poppop. Lets not forget about him.
7423
Not to mention the young strider and lalonde relatives. I bet theyre a barrel of laughs. I met them once but i was too shy to say anything. Then i got in a fight. Did i ever mention that jane?
7423
Not to say its been all downtime and doldrums. Exploring has been great. Finding treasure, solving riddles, becoming better friends. I wouldnt trade that for anything.
7423
And maybe we are getting close to something big happening regardless? Every day it seems like more and more undead creatures crawl from out of the shadows. Bigger ones and stronger ones. Does their presence herald something worse coming, just as the legends indicate our presence heralds something better?
7423
I just wish we could actually kill the fucking things. Even the little ones can absorb so much damage before yielding any spoils!
7423
Remember jane? Remember at the start how we kept trying to kill them?
7423
We would all gang up on like an imp skeleton for an hour just clobbering it repeatedly. Knocking its bones down, waiting for it to reassemble and keep coming at us. Only to finally be rewarded with a shitty pittance of grist!
7423
But i guess the silver lining was it forced us to explore ruins more often and scavenge for loot there. So i think weve learned a lot more this way.
7423
But it sure makes resources hard to come by, having to get them exclusively from chests and whatnot. Sometimes i wonder if weve been missing out on a really rewarding part of the game by neglecting to build up our houses? Makes you wonder. But it just costs so much! Better to stick to making more practical stuff dont you think?
7423
Sometimes i wonder if the heroes had the same problems in their game. Do you think they found an easier way to kill skeletons?
7423
Were they just as shameless as us when it came to splurging our precious grist on swanky new duds?
7423
Did the same enigmatic bard haunt their game? And if so which hilarious dead trolls did he throw into the flashy blobs?
7423
Mr erisol tells me he knows many things about the heroes because he saw them in action when he was alive. But he wont tell me a thing about them! These troll sprites sure do love keeping their secrets dont they? Heheh.
7423
Okay we can talk about that if you insist.
7423
Really jane you sure know how to twist a fellas arm!
7423
I just wanted to get your take on what you might call my own personal ultimate riddle.
7423
It involves dirk.
7424
Its true. I havent seen him in a couple days.
7424
I have been laying low for a while but i just received another series of pushy inquiries from him.
7424
Maybe i shouldnt be too hard on the guy since he was probably just concerned, not having heard from me and all.
7424
But i still couldnt help but detect a tone of desperation, like he could sense i may be having doubts.
7424
This kind of thing has been all too common unfortunately.
7424
Im not sure its going to work anymore.
7424
He can be so needy!
7424
If only he could just relax and trust that i wont spontaneously tire of his company.
7424
Although the irony i guess is that his overbearing tendencies are beginning to fulfill his own paranoid prophecy.
7424
Its such a shame. Weve had so many capital adventures together.
7424
I dont know why he has to be like this. He always was an intense fella. But in person... holy cow.
7424
I wonder if it has to do with the fact that he grew up alone in the middle of the ocean? And now he doesnt know how to deal with people without suffocating them?
7424
But then again i grew up under similar circumstances and i think i turned out pretty much ok socially, at least i hope so. Do you think so jane?
7424
Actually it just occurred to me. Its funny he didnt mention your party in his text.
7424
Im SURE he wouldnt have forgotten. He never forgets ANYTHING what with all his calculations and his computerized brain. Both figurative and literal.
7424
I wonder what his game was? He invited me on an expedition without mention of your party as a potential conflict...
7424
If he sensed i could use some space perhaps he was concerned that if we both showed up to the party it would be awkward?
7424
Or maybe he didnt want to mention he was going to the party in case it would spook me away from attending?
7424
Argh! Do you see jane?? This is what his endless machinations do to you!
7424
Anything he says could be part of some grand convoluted scheme and it just makes you agonize and boggle and wonder until your brain hurts and you just KNOW its a battle you cant win.
7424
You know what i mean jane?
7424
Do you think i should just bite the bullet and end it?
7424
Its probably the right thing to do.
7424
Boy am i not looking forward to that conversation though.
7424
Its going to be a doozy. What did i get myself into here?
7424
I think ive made a lot of mistakes honestly.
7424
Not the least of which was getting this shitty tattoo, now that i think about it.
7424
Yes yes i know we all thought it was a riot at first.
7424
I guess it still is maybe? But lately ive been wondering if it might not have been an act of sound judgment.
7424
Can you believe that jane?
7424
I dont know. Its a real pickle im in here but i do feel better just being able to get it off my chest.
7424
You are such a good friend jane, always ready to listen to my relationship woes. What a trooper!
7425
It never ceases to amaze me how excellent you are at this friendship business. Where would we all be without you?
7425
In a way you really have been the glue holding us all together on our adventure. Gosh youre a standup gal.
7425
Oh which actually reminds me of ANOTHER thing thats been bugging me about dirk.
7425
He can often be almost hilariously self absorbed. Dont even get me started on when he starts going off on these long monologues about his philosophical gobbledygook.
7425
I'm not sure he actually has much of a filter when it comes to what others regard as interesting points of conversation.
7425
Not to rag on the guy too hard but i guess at times i would just like to see a little more self awareness from him is all.
7425
Did i tell you what happened on our last expedition together?
7425
I cant remember if i mentioned. Oh man but thinking back on what happened its even more ridiculous in retrospect.
7425
Where do i begin?
7425
What?
7425
Huh?
7425
Errr.
7425
Did i say something wrong?
7426
I dont...
7426
Wha...
7427
Ay caramba.
7427
What in tarnation is the matter jane?
7427
Whoa there.
7427
You seem really worked up. Maybe we should just calm down and talk this through like sensible adults?
7427
Also youre going kinda heavy on the caps there arent you? Sort of makes it seem like your shouting. Just saying.
7427
Yikes.
7427
Well ok then.
7427
Can you tell me why youre so upset with me?
7427
Is it because i forgot your birthday party? Because i do feel awful about that.
7427
Really i feel like a tool about forgetting. You know how i am. I forget stuff.
7427
I mean...
7427
Shucks buster. If i knew how to make it up to you i would.
7427
If it ameliorates matters any i am sighing pretty much the shucksiest buster of contrition i can manage.
7427
I thought shucks buster was...
7427
Sorta our thing?
7427
Uhh.
7427
Ok?
7427
I suppose i could go with shoot buddy. Or...
7427
Fudge junior?
7427
Or maybe forgo an analogous catch phrase altogether heh.
7427
But i clearly stepped in it big time with you and id really like to know what i did.
7428
Hmm.
7428
Wasnt it a few days ago?
7428
I didnt realize it was so long ago. Sorry about that.
7428
Again all i can say is where does the time go? I guess i have trouble keeping up with everything im supposed to. Which it would seem includes personal relationships as much as calendars.
7428
Im not much of a leader of people. Not like you are jane. I think when it comes to adventuring maybe im more of a solo act?
7428
Which now that i think about it might be contributing to my problems with dirk. Maybe thats part of the reason why i needed some space?
7428
Oh brother there i go again blustering about my problems. I guess i see what you mean.
7428
But really if you wanted to talk sooner then why didnt you get in touch with me?
7428
It feels as though im always the one to say hello to you lately.
7428
Huh?
7428
Used to feel what?
7428
Now hold the phone.
7428
Jane i think i may finally understand whats been going on here.
7428
In retrospect i cant believe ive been this blind.
7428
Youre right i really can be deplorably thick sometimes.
7428
Looking back i can see how many of our conversations must have been torment for you.
7428
You really should have told me how you felt sooner!
7428
If you told me you had the hots for dirk i would have backed off without another word.
7428
What are friends for!
7430
Wait...
7430
Did i say something dumb again?
7430
Consarn it.
7430
I think maybe something is getting lost in translation over our respective chat clients.
7430
Maybe we should wait until tomorrow and just clear the air face to face at your party?
7430
Aw come on jane. Be a sport.
7430
I say jane. Before you do anything rash...
7569
Do what now?
7569
Hey take that back roxys my good friend!
7569
Well ok take back all the parts that werent a compliment.
7569
Or wait. Is calling her hot a compliment or is that creepy?
7569
She is certainly pretty. But hearing it come from you sounds lecherous and dastardly!
7569
Heh. Its probably just my instincts as a brave boy kicking in.
7569
The old chivalry bone acting up you know? When i hear a ladys good name getting besmirched i just start seeing red!!!
7569
Errr.
7569
Alright?
7569
Gentlemanly you say?
7569
It isnt?
7569
Um...
7569
Your...
7569
Boypledge?
7570
Yeah. Dirk is a pretty tough cookie alright...
7570
But i thought you hated me!
7570
At least thats how i remember it when we last talked.
7570
Which was admittedly a while ago.
7570
Ive never been accused of having a photographic memory but i dont recall you typing in green either.
7570
Are you ripping me off bro??
7570
I dont think I understand.
7570
Whys that?
7570
Hey!
7570
Oh. Whoops.
7570
Go on then.
7571
You think so?
7571
Not to sound too self obsessed or anything but ive given that some thought.
7571
That maybe there is something special about me that nobody can understand. And maybe thats why i always seem to be botching things up the wazoo with my pals.
7571
Maybe thats why i feel like such a loner. I dunno. Im rambling and ive been thinking about it a lot lately. What about you?
7571
Does being special make you screw the pooch with your friends like it does for me?
7571
Wow really?
7571
Haha. Well i wouldnt go that far. I love my friends!
7571
But i was once told i had a lot of potential.
7571
Supposedly thats how all pages are and it takes them for frickin EVER to reach it.
7571
And funnily enough it was a figment of my own subconscious that told me this. A part of my untapped potential itself! But disguised as my best bro which was...
7571
Peculiar to say the least.
7571
Is that your situation? Are you a page too?
7571
Oh? Whats yours then?
7571
Fine then jeez.
7571
Sorry for asking!
7571
Oh.
7571
Sakes alive.
7571
That is a bit extreme no?
7571
I dont think thats a word.
7571
But hey you are the lord and i am the lowly page.
7572
Now just a minute buddy. Lets not get carried away.
7572
I have no intention of serving you. In fact im not even sure why im still talking to you!
7572
Youre lucky that my manners are impeccable otherwise i would have blocked you already, what with the scandalous way you have characterized my ladyfriends alone.
7572
Its all well and good you think we have some things in common but i wont fall for it!
7572
Maybe its true at times i can be a little slow on the uptake but i will not be sweet talked into doing the bidding for a silver tongued cur!!!
7572
So to you sir lord i must say GOOD DAY.
7572
Whatever! Look i know you are not the most quickwitted fella either, so i must inform you this is what we call a "figure of speech."
7572
You know. Like if i said you speak with a forked tongue. Not unlike LUCIFER HIMSELF!!!
7572
Oh...
7572
Really?
7572
It just means you arent trustworthy, and i should not be lulled by your false promises.
7572
No im not!
7572
Dont you mean benevolence?
7572
Um. Ok then.
7572
But why do you want to help me?
7572
Is it really just because you relate to me and therefore want me to succeed?
7572
Hey watch it now. Youre DARN TOOTIN i love to roughhouse!!!
7572
Huh??
7572
Whoa.
7572
Thats uh.
7572
Mighty special.
7572
Yeah um.
7572
Maybe later?
7572
I dont think i want it to be honest.
7572
No offense its actually just really shitty.
7572
Ok fine!
7572
Gad freaking zooks. Just what i need another pushy bro in my life.
7572
This secret training of yours better be worth it!
7572
But i thought you werent a troll.
7572
Its not helping me understand though.
7572
Shoudlnt you be a patron cherub if anything?
7572
Sounds pretty gay.
7572
Whats what?
7572
Oh right.
7572
Forgive me i forget you arent familiar with all of my earth lingo.
7572
Its like...
7572
How do i explain.
7572
You know. Its a rather old fashioned term for being jolly and festive together.
7572
Like "that rollicking time we had scrumming the other eve sure was gay."
7573
Oh goody. Just the way i like my hijinks!
7573
So how do we start.
7573
I was?
7573
How was i going to do the stuff if you didnt tell me to?
7573
You mean i was going to do it like on accident?
7573
I dont understand.
7573
Ok then.
7573
Im glad we settled that.
7573
Hmmmmm...
7573
Nope!
7573
Dont reckon i understand much of that either.
7573
But i guess im not supposed to. Me not being a time maestro or what have you.
7573
I guess i should be boning up on hope though. What can you tell me about that?
7573
Tell you about hope?
7573
Um well its something i think everyone should have in their hearts.
7573
But i wasnt finished!
7573
Hope to me is all about believing in stuff.
7573
If you believe in stuff then everything feels like its going to turn out ok.
7573
And if you believe in stuff with enough gusto i dare say it imbues that stuff with a pinch more chutzpah. Even the fake stuff!
7573
And then if you keep an open mind and adventurous spirit, that chutzpah flows directly into your heart, and thats when YOU have the power.
7573
So i think if hope grants one the power to smite villainy and vanquish hooligans thats probably where it comes from!
7573
Well THERES your problem dude. You dont want to BELIEVE!
7573
Just let go and believe in things. Then youll find you had the power in you all along.
7574
How do i do that?
7574
Die???
7574
Ok then. I will choose to believe you.
7574
See what i did there? I just scored a few more hope points!
7574
By strengthening my trust in you as well as our burgeoning friendship.
7574
Oh also, friendship is a HUGE key to being good at hope. I forgot to mention that.
7574
Me neither!
7574
So you say you will help me be a god tier...
7574
But there are other ways you will help too?
7574
Neat!
7574
But what the bejesus is a juju?
7574
That would be hunky dory.
7574
In my view distinguished gentlemen should always strive to be as gay as possible with each other.
7575
Sounds straight forward enough.
7575
Whats the code?
7575
Ok.
7575
Hmm.
7575
We could try to guess it maybe?
7575
Yeah. Youre probably right.
7575
So what sort of magical properties does your juju have?
7575
Really?
7575
That sounds almost too good to be true.
7575
If you dont even know what your juju does by itself why do you think they do that together?
7575
Oh why didnt you say so! Thats all i needed to hear!!!
7575
See youre getting the hang of hope already.
7575
Roger that mr lord.
7575
Say. Dont you have a name? We know your sisters name... cant we know yours now too?
7575
Well i surely dont want to spoil any clean trousers.
7575
Even though your warning sounds a little hyperbolic i will trust you.
7575
Um. My lord.
7575
Heheheh when i call you that people could mistake our conversation for a nefarious and underhanded collusion among felons!
7575
As you wish... MY LORD.
7575
HEHEHEHEHEH!
7575
So lord. May i ask...
7575
Why are you giving me your juju if it is so dear to you?
7575
Is your commitment to this manbro boypledge of yours really that strong?
7575
If so im really impressed. I would have a really hard time giving my favorite stuff away to a total stranger.
7575
Yeah? Then that is quite a treasure you found.
7575
Where did you get it? Did you plunder a tomb or such?
7575
Well that sounds nice of him. He cant be that much of an asshole if he gave you such a nice present can he?
7575
I had a clown give me a nice present once too. I would never have met my good friend mr erisol without the kindness of that clown.
7575
So whats this juju he gave you?
7576
Gosh...
7576
That might just be the gayest thing ive ever heard.
7591
Jane are you there?
7591
I wouldnt blame you for not answering since i was such a shitty boor to you last time.
7591
I just wanted to formally say happy birthday.
7591
And also to pass along a birthday present.
7591
I doubt it will make up for all the ways ive hurt your feelings but maybe it will be a start?
7591
Its some fancy juju thingamabob that calliopes bro gave to me.
7591
He specifically gave it to me to make me better so i could get stronger and punch him in the snout some day or something?
7591
I dunno about that. I dont think i care about becoming a great hero and challenging a weird grumpy alien all that much.
7591
Not nearly as much as my friendship with you.
7591
So i want you to have it instead.
7591
Just use the code to make it. The code is...
7591
Um...
7591
ORBROBuRBROS?
7591
No wait.
7591
Thats way too long...
7591
uBORBuBROS?
7591
How many letters were codes supposed to have?
7591
Fuck.
7591
BROBuROBuT
7591
ORuBuBROBOS

7618

7619

7619

7619

7619

7619
Jane
7619
I...
7619

7619
Jane youre frightening me!
7620
No jane you are seriously scaring the shit out of me!
7620
You seem unwell...
7620
Are you sure youre alright?
7694
Roxy?
7694
I take it by that disgruntled series of letters that youre feeling about as cruddy as me and jane right now.
7694
Well you know what they say about misery. And how it supposedly enjoys company.
7694
Hiyoooo!
7694
Point well taken.
7694
Indubitably. Rest assured it feels like a brood of anxious vermin is making its most valiant effort to escape from my skull.
7695

7700
Er roxy while youre at it...
7700
Do you think you could relay the same sentiments to dirk?
7700
I was thinking about all the stuff he said to me while we were all telling him to dance.
7700
And yeah i was really being a prick when i ran away to lomax.
7700
He was right about everything. I should have come clean about wanting some space.
7700
I know! Im so terrible im sorry!!!
7700
Im just not feeling up to those conversations yet.
7700
My head is KILLING me! Augh grandma why did your sweet skull based computing technology have to be such a BRAIN FUCKER!
7700
Why?
7700
Why not??
7700
Golly.
7700
But you are talking to jane yes?
7700
Well...
7700
Seeing as shes presumably talking to dirk...
7700
And youre relaying my apology to her already...
7700
Why dont you relay my apology to dirk through her?
7700
Why not!
7700
Shed probably be a sport about it.
7700
Hell they could probably bond over what an absolute douchemuffin ive been to them both.
7700
And if theres some heavy business youre having trouble addressing with dirk in person you could get jane to relay him a message for you as well!
7701
Er roxy while youre at it...
7701
Do you think you could relay the same sentiments to dirk?
7701

Im sorry for being a pest but i just see jane there pecking away at conversations with you and dirk and it feels like youre all kind of leaving me behind.
7706

8343
Please let me go back to earth jane! Just like it used to be! I just want to go back to my pumpkin patch in the jungle when things were simpler and all i had to worry about was being tackled by a feisty robot. I want to go back to when i didnt ruin all my friendships and when you didnt hate me and when you didnt go crazy and tell me to be your weird royal husband slave!
8343
WAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

Something sufficiently felonious i presume?
