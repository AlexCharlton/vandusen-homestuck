KANAYA )(I!
Glub glub glub glub glub!
38)
Glub glub glub glub glub glub glub!
)(a)(a sorry!
I cant really control t)(e glubs.
I AM -EXCIT-ED!
-Everyt)(ing we are about to do next is exciting.
It is always exciting.
I'm -EXCIT----------------ED!
Pc)(ooooo.
)(a)(a yea)( I really launc)(ed t)(at one.
)(-E)(-E!
Glub glub glub!
)(-EY! Lets stop being retarded for a minute.
I am just worked up about t)(is game, it will be great.
Ive been waiting a long time to get started! We all )(ave.
We s)(ould compare notes. Even t)(oug)( we are on different teams!
)(mm really?
See t)(is is w)(y we s)(ould be comparing notes! 38O
)(mmmmmm.
Well I am going to join my team pretty late.
I t)(ink I )(ave to!
I will need to connect after my goofball moirail does so I can keep my goggles on )(is nefarious escapades.
Its a toug)( job but its important! Everyone )(as an important job to do.
Isnt t)(at w)(at youre doing too? Joining late to keep an eye on yours?
)(a)(a youre not supposed to know for a FACT dummy!
You just do w)(at you t)(ink is rig)(t and even if you were wrong t)(e worst t)(at )(appened was you )(elped somebody and )(elped t)(e w)(ole world too!
Glub glub glub glub S)(RUG.
Yes probably!
Your clouds tell you everyt)(ing so w)(at do you even )(ave to worry about?
T)(ats true.
O)( s)(ucks now Im going to get sad.
S)(e will be gone soon. 38(
T)(oug)( I guess it will be a relief not to )(ave to worry about keeping )(er voice down anymore!
T)(ey arent burdens!
Ok I guess t)(ey are )(a)(a.
But I love t)(em and I wouldnt )(ave it any ot)(er way because t)(is is w)(y Im )(ere!
On t)(at note I t)(ink Im going to go say goodbye to )(er. Maybe you s)(ould too w)(ile you )(ave t)(e c)(ance!
Even t)(oug)( Ill see )(er again soon w)(ic)( still seems kind of strange to me.
But t)(ats w)(y t)(is is all so -EXCITING!
KANAYA BY----------------------------E!
?
Glub glub!
38)
W)(at is it!!!
I am wondering if you can forego t)(e exaggerated emotional t)(eatrics for once and actually tell me w)(at's on your mind!
38|
Yes I do.
We are supposed to talk to eac)( ot)(er, t)(at is w)(at moirails are for.
Glub glub glub glub siiiiig)(.
Will you take t)(e c)(ip off your nub and tell me w)(at's t)(e matter?
Are you fretting over anot)(er one of t)(ese dumb contraptions?
No I'm not! But t)(at is beside t)(e point.
None of your plots to kill t)(e land dwellers ever work out, and every doomsday device you get your )(ands on turns out to be a piece of junk!
I t)(ink deep down you stack t)(ese plots against you so you fail because you know it's wrong.
T)(is is t)(e last time I will say t)(is.
W-E AR-E NOT B-ETT-ER T)(AN ANYBODY!!!!!
GLUB. >38(
If you're as sickened by t)(em as you say, w)(y do you spend so muc)( time on land?
You can't )(ave t)(e sort of affinity for "our kind" t)(at you profess if you've only spent, w)(at...
A few days underwater, maybe? IN YOUR W)(OL-E LIF-E!
W)(at about your friends? Do you ever t)(ink about t)(em?
If t)(ey are beneat)( you t)(en t)(ey )(ave to die too.
And I know you like talking to some of t)(em. You say you )(ate t)(em but I t)(ink you are pretending!
Mmm )(mm.
I )(ave a fis)(y feeling...
T)(at t)(is stupid doomsday mac)(ine t)(ing is just anot)(er excuse to consort!
Wit)( someone in particular...
38P
38O
DON'T YOU GLUB IN T)(AT TON-E OF GLUB WIT)( M-E MIST-ER!
O)( S)(IT, you are angling for SO MUC)( TROUBL-E NOW.
)(-E)(-E ok. 38)
Um, I guess?
I wouldn't really know.
Sometimes people just drift away I t)(ink, or just aren't as into t)(e quadrant as t)(e ot)(er wants to be.
So you really t)(ink your feelings for )(er run t)(at dark?
T)(at is so ridiculous, any girl would be lucky to )(ave a kismesis as diabolical as you, especially T)(AT one.
W)(o knows w)(at )(er problem is! S)(e )(as issues.
You know, I'm not sure w)(y we never talk about our romantic aspirations.
We s)(ould more often. It is kind of -EXCITING!
Probably because you fill your gossip quota wit)( your nubby )(orned bro.
You leave not)(ing left to talk about wit)( your dear sweet moirail!
We are supposed to )(elp eac)( ot)(er wit)( t)(at stuff too, remember.
Your stupid fis)(y face is w)(at's odd!
)(AV-E YOU -EV-ER T)(OUG)(T ABOUT T)(AT??
Um...
Yea)(. I can't t)(ink of anybody I feel t)(at way about. 38\
Maybe I am just not old enoug)( to )(ave t)(ose feelings yet? We are still pretty young you know.
So ok. T)(ose are your black leanings.
W)(at about R-ED, ------Eridan???
)(MMMMM??????? 38D
Is t)(ere a lucky lady you are waxing scarlet for?
OR LUCKY F-ELLOW??? 38O
Tell me!
Don't pretend you're all -EMBARRASS-ED SUDD-ENLY!!!
38o
38(
W)()()()()(-E-E-E-E-EW.
Yea)(...
Yes, it was a pretty close call, and got kind of complicated.
But Sollux finally came t)(roug)(, and now I believe t)(e full c)(ain is complete!
YOUR STUPID FIS)(Y FAC-E IS T)(-E DRAMA MAC)(IN-E T)(AT DO-ES NOT)(ING BUT W)(IN-E AND GLUB.
38P
Anyway you s)(ouldn't say t)(at about )(im, )(e is a )(ero and )(e saved my life.
O)(, really?
T)(at's good! Actually, I )(ave somet)(ing I )(ave been meaning to say to you too.
Mm, okay.
But t)(is isn't easy to say!
Okay, I )(ope so.
I t)(ink...
Now t)(at we are bot)( in t)(is game, and )(ave left our world be)(ind...
And you can no longer pose t)(e danger to our people t)(at you )(ad always planned to...
I t)(ink it is not really necessary for me to be your moirail anymore.
38(
I am really sorry, -Eridan. It )(as just been so )(ard looking after you and keeping you out of trouble!
It )(as taken its toll, and )(onestly I am really ex)(austed.
I'm sorry!!! 38'(
It will be t)(e best for bot)( of us. We can just sort of be...
Regular friends instead.
Uh...
Okay, I am being serious and honest too. SEE?
I am not sick of you, Eridan! I still really like you.
In order to be destined for moirallegience, both people have to be on board, don't you think?
But I cannot do it anymore. So I think it just wasn't meant to be all along.
And really, you just don't need me anymore. You are free to do as you wish! We both are.
I can't look after you anymore.
Was what?
Tell me!
Oh?
What do you mean?
38O
No, I hadn't thought about it!
Um...
I really don't know about that.
I do! But I don't know if it's really in that way.
I've never had a chance to consider anything like that! I have just spent all my time worrying about you and trying to keep you from killing everybody or hurting yourself.
It took all my energy.
I don't think I have anything left for those feelings either.
What?
STOP!!!!!!!!!!!
God.
Will you just clam up for once in your life?
Always carping and carping and carping!
You go completely overboard with your emotions, always looking to reel in drama wherever you can.
I am up to my gills in it! I just can't salmon the strength anemonemore.
HEHEHE, sorry.
But really, this shouldn't be as bad as it sounds.
When all is said and done, I am still your friend.
We have left our world behind. Everyone is dead, and there's no use in worrying about it now.
It's over! It is time to play this game and focus on building something new and ------EXCITING.
So )(ang in t)(ere, -Eridan.
I )(ave to go now! Sollux is in serious trouble, and I )(ave to go )(elp )(im.
BY------------------------E!
Glub glub. 38) 
S-E-E?? 
I told you! 
T)(ere is not)(ing to worry about at all. 
)(oly mackerel, looks like SOM-EON-E woke up on t)(e wrong side of t)(e absurd )(uman bed! 
C)(ill out, Jade. I am just following up on w)(at I told you earlier. 
About your dream! Your post-dreamdeat)( dreamself's dream. 
Errr. W)(ic)( is a term I just made up now. 38| 
Yes, I imagine not! You )(ave spent your w)(ole life dreaming about prospit, no? 
Yes, Jade. It is time to face t)(e facts! 
Our moons are gone too. If we wis)( to sleep now, our dreams must take place in t)(e bubbles glubbed by t)(e gods w)(o live in t)(e Furt)(est Ring. 
It is t)(e infinite space w)(ic)( divides all sessions, completely unnavigable and unfat)(omable, untouc)(ed by t)(e time or space of any universe in existence. 
Its lords are our slumberbuddies now. 38) 
Don't be ridiculous. T)(ey are not as dreadful as t)(ey look. 
In fact, t)(ey are quite )(elpful if you know )(ow to talk to t)(em! 
Don't you remember our dream? I was trying to s)(ow you t)(at t)(ere is not)(ing to fear. 
But t)(en... you kind of freaked out! )(umans are so M-ELODRAMATIC. 
)(ELL YEA)(! 38D 
GLUUUUB oh fine. 
I will suspend my neato quirk just for you. 
I hereby renounce the royal mark of sea dweller supremacy in the interest of INT-ERSP-ECI-ES DIPLOMACY. 
JEGUS JADE. 
Look! It is like a cool trident I throw sometimes. 
oooooo ---------------E 
How is that not awesome! 
Okay, you win. I have officially humbled myself before you. Entirely glubbing peasant-IFICATED for your pleasure. 
Shall I clip my fins for you as well, your majesty? 
Well, thank you! On both counts, of being likened to something other than an obnoxious human, as well as on my exotic looks. 
For the record, you look pretty awesomely weird too. 
I introduced myself before, but since you do not remember, I will do so now. My name is Feferi, and I was going to be the Empress, but now I am not! 
Hell if I know! 
In your pre-death dream at least. Oh, well you died obviously, so there's that. 
All I could see was what happened in your hive. 
You were asleep, and then your robot exploded. 
And then your lusus saved you! Kind of like mine saved me. 
Before she died. 38C 
Oh? Who was that? 
Ah, Karkat. Of course. 
Yes, he's our leader. Why did he want you to talk to him? 
Glubshrug. 
He's pretty harmless, really. You get used to his yelling. 
I do not even process it as yelling anymore. More like a lot of blubbering. 
More blubber spills out of that mouth than a gash in a poached whale. 
Gluuuuuub, I just made myself hungry. 380~ 
Hey! We're the aristocracy. We've got a duty to be weird. 
Anyway, go talk to your shoutfriend I guess. 
And hey, if you want to take another nap sometime, let me know! They will be more than happy to glub us up another bubble. 
PSH WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, MISS HORNLESS MCFINLESS. 
Why, if I'm not mistaken, you are looking a little drowsy right now. We may meet again sooner than you think. 38D 
Glub glub glub glub glub! 
)(ey, take it easy! 
I'm not )(ere to give you a )(ard time like my buddies )(ave been. 
Ok t)(en, you can be t)(e judge of t)(at. I won't be long! 
I've just come to say a couple t)(ings. 
FIRST! 
None of t)(is is really your fault! 
T)(is is swimmingly obvious to everyone )(ere w)(o takes a glubbing moment to t)(ink about it rationally. 
W)(ic)( isn't many of us! But still. 
I mean, your lusus jumped rig)(t in t)(ere to save you! 
Just like mine did. 
Well ok, mine was dead at t)(e time. 38( 
And s)(e just kind of... 
F-ELL IN! 
Kinda drifted down like fis)(food, and POW, GL'BGOLYBSPRIT-E. 
)(e)(e)(e)(e)(e)(e)(. S)(e was so funny. 
It's a big ol' monster custodian you grow up wit)(! 
S)(-E-ES)(, )(ow freaking retarded do you )(ave to be not to know somet)(ing like t)(at? 
I'm joking, of course. 38) 
I wanted to glub somet)(ing -ELS-E to you well before you started playing. 
Just to get t)(e idea in your )(ead! 
I am Feferi, by t)(e way. Abdicated empress to be! 
Soon I will go to sleep and speak to t)(e gods. 
I will convince t)(em to establis)( a series of stable dream bubbles, w)(ere we can meet in our sleep! 
YOU'LL S-E----------E! 38D 
Did I? 
When?? 
)(mm. 
Jade, t)(is is t)(e first time we )(ave ever talked! 
Isn't it??? 
W)(at's t)(at? 
Well, maybe we did! 
)(ey, by t)(e way. 
W)(at exactly are you doing t)(ere wit)( t)(at toy? 
You never did explain it to me!
Good point. 
Maybe I'm feeling it too. 
I )(ave... w)(at was it? Orca vu? 
38? 
In the future! Duh. 
Yes, you are asleep. But your dream self died, just like mine, remember? 
Now you don't dream about Prospit. You have normal dreams! 
It is a dream, and a memory. It is the past, brought back to life by a witch! It's all those things. 
Although we are getting off the script here! 
This is not how the conversation originally went, obviously. 
You were a lot less patient with me! When I was just trying to ENCOURAGE you. 
Sure! 
Hey, why don't you tell me about this cool robot bunny you we're making? 
I've been pretty glubbing curious about it! 
Mind if I take a look? 
It's great! 
Wish I could make something like this. Never had the gills for technology. 
Hard to work with under water! 
Nope! 
I woke up from my nap a while ago. 
Remember how I woke up and then messaged you? You had just had a bad dream! 
And I told you there was nothing to be scared of. 
Which there isn't! 
Because, stupid. 
I'M D------EAD!
