Kaaaaaaaarkat!
I'm sorry!
8ut do you have any idea how funny this thing is? I mean this whole thing???????? I can't stop laughing!
I'm not going to try, I'm just here to say this whole thing is ridiculous.
We didn't really need you to pretend to 8e a little angry general to get any of this done.
We kicked the queen out of there no sweat! It was easy. In fact, I did most of the work myself, right 8efore I found all the treasure and scaled all the rungs.
Hey, I'm gone. I just think you should relax.
You were wound up so tight through the whole adventure, and now here in the present you're a8out to explode. It's insuffera8le!
Hahahahahahahaha.
Yes, you told him 8ro!
I distinctly remem8er you telling him a8out stairs. 8ut he didn't listen.
He never listens! None of you do, really.
And now all of your extra lives are waaaaaaaasted.
What a 8unch of losers! I'm outta here.
You doofus!!!!!!!!
