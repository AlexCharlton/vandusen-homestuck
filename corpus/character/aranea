6826
Well, Jake? Don't you have anything to say?
6826
I think I've spent enough time introducing myself! You have hardly said a word.
6826
It would 8e nice to know whether my long story has confounded you in any particular way, or if you are just 8eing shy.
6826
Yes?
6826
Jake, I understand this is very much to learn all at once, 8ut do you really want me to keep speaking until I am 8lue in the face?
6826
You appear to 8e perspiring heavily.
6826
There is no reason to 8e so nervous, especially considering you are only dreaming.
6826
It's ok.
6826
Well, at the risk talking a8out myself a little more, I feel it would 8e dishonest not to confess.
6826
I am a fairly gifted psychic.
6826
Yes.
6826
No, that was a fine question. They're troll powers. Sometimes those of my 8lood type will have them naturally.
6826
And no, they are not prognosticative a8ilities. They let me access another's mind in a way that can 8e terri8ly invasive if a8used.
6826
Yes. Including the a8ility to control minds, when exploited fully.
6826
8ut don't worry. They don't seem to work the same way on your species. They're considera8ly weaker.
6826
The most I can do is get an empathic impression of your emotional state.
6826
So if I speculate that you are shy or nervous, it is 8ecause I can sense that you are.
6826
I wouldn't say you 8lew it, 8ut that was certainly odd.
6826
Who were you talking to, if you don't mind my asking?
6826
I am not a 8rain invader though!
6826
I said I can only sense your emotions. I think it's polite to let people know 8efore long. Otherwise I 8egin to feel a 8it underhanded.
6826
8ut you don't have to! That was not the point of my telling you.
6826
I'm used to sensing many things from people. There aren't any feelings you could have that would 8e that surprising to me or compromising to you.
6826
I really just want you to relax for the 8rief time we have in this 8u88le and talk to me.
6826
Well, I have spent almost no time examining this iteration of your universe.
6826
The gods have given me very little access to it through the memories of others until now.
6826
I 8elieve they are finally 8eginning to 8ridge the divides 8etween long estranged compartments of reality, allowing previously unintroduced parties to mingle.
6826
Those from different universes, 8oth their initial iterations and their scratched re8oots. Those from different spheres, ones of creative potential and of mortality.
6826
Through us all they attempt to 8ring closure to unsanctioned loops and restore sta8ility to the cosmos.
6826
So I am curious a8out you and your friends. What is your life like?
6826
I understand. The same is mostly true for myself.
6826
I can sense that you are either very impressed or in some way intimidated 8y me, 8ut when it comes down to the 8asics, a description of my life would 8e 8oring as well.
6826
Why don't you show me around?
6826
Nope. ::::)
6826
What was that?
6826
Jake?
6826
Hmm.
6826
Should I leave and come 8ack during another dream?
6827
Ok then.
6827
What's this? An illustrated story of some sort?
6827
Why are you getting flustered a8out this literature?
6827
Is it pornographic?
6827
It does not strike me as indecent at a glance. Though may8e our cultures have different standards?
6827
Jake.
6827
You know, it's not the first time I've sensed that someone felt a flushed attraction for me.
6828
You really don't have to 8e so em8arrassed. It's perfectly ok.
6828
Actually I do 8elieve it would 8e within the scope of my a8ilities to get you to wake up.
6828
8ut do you really want me to do that?
6828
If it is true that you think I am attractive then why wouldn't you want to spend a little more time here with me? What's the harm?
6828
Are you really in such a hurry to leave and feel sorry for yourself, for no explica8le reason?
6828
I already told you, Jake.
6828
I am used to sensing many different types of feelings.
6828
It's given me a different perspective on emotions than most have.
6828
For most, the feelings of others are often a mystery. So they are prone to speculation and paranoia a8out the motivations of people they meet.
6828
The emotions of others can seem like such well guarded mysteries, people 8egin to 8elieve that's how their own emotions should 8e treated as well. So when someone can read their thoughts easily it feels like a violation.
6828
8ut to one accustomed to reading those thoughts, there isn't the same perception of violation or secrecy. It's more like examining other self evident facts a8out a person, like taking note of their appearance.
6828
It's still hard for non-psychics to understand this though, even if you explain it to them. It can lead to some awkward relationships, unfortunately.
6828
Fellows, yes. And ladies. It's happened.
6828
Haha! Oh no. No, not really.
6828
The fact that I've 8een the fleeting o8ject of attraction to a handful really paints the wrong social picture I'm afraid.
6828
It's my experience that people very often underestimate their own lika8ility. I sense that feeling all the time.
6828
Pro8a8ly 8ecause they're in the dark a8out others' thoughts. They are usually in dou8t, so they frequently err on the side of pessimism.
6828
In many cases they would 8e surprised if they knew how many around them were open to friendship, or possi8ly something more.
6828
I would venture that if you had such a sense you even might 8e surprised yourself!
6828
Let's not get carried away. That certainly does not descri8e my experience.
6828
You would think 8eing a8le to sense the occasional attraction from others would 8e advantageous, and inspire confidence in yourself.
6828
And it is nice when that happens, sure.
6828
8ut then, you feel the negative emotions directed at you as well.
6828
And even if they are less common than the positive ones, you have a way of dwelling on them, and magnifying them far 8eyond their real significance.
6828
It's funny how an a8ility that should give you all the advantages in the world over others can lead you to feel worse a8out yourself than if you never had them.
6828
You put all your energy into thinking a8out people with the 8ad feelings a8out you instead of the good, and you try your 8est to fix things.
6828
8ut usually it just gets worse. People think you are over8earing and needy, and they don't understand what it is you want from them.
6828
I can see why it can drive some with my a8ilities to a8use the powers.
6828
Fortunately I was a8le to resist the temptation.
6828
On the world I was from, it was rare. Only a few criminals and outcasts would.
6828
8ut in the second iteration I mentioned, it was commonplace. Like I said, things were very different.
6828
In my world though, the higher castes have a lot of responsi8ilities. It wouldn't 8e right to a8use my powers.
6828
Ah, so you were listening to my lengthy pream8le!
6828
Yes. 8lue 8loods like myself were higher than most.
6828
The jo8 of each 8lood caste was to serve the needs of all those 8elow it.
6828
We were to use our progressively greater longevity and wisdom to help the lower castes learn and grow. To listen to them and try to provide whatever they were missing. Like a hierarchy of caretakers with increasing social responsi8ility. When the order functioned in harmony our civilization would flourish.
6828
Yes.
6828
Yes.
6828
Who told you that?
6828
That's interesting.
6828
I wasn't planning on mentioning that. Or at least not just yet.
6828
There's no reason to prematurely overcomplicate an already complicated tale.
6828
All facts will fall into place in due time.
6828
More or less.
6829
He most certainly is a skull monster.
6829
A very 8ig and angry skull monster.
6829
I didn't say you were supposed to kill him.
6829
He cannot 8e killed.
6829
Long ago he discovered the secret to indestructi8ility.
6829
Defeating a foe doesn't always involve killing.
6829
He has had many incarnations in many universes.
6829
If you continue on your journey for long enough, you may encounter one of them.
6829
And if you have 8ecome strong enough 8y then, you may 8e a8le to defeat him in com8at.
6829
And if that comes to pass, it would 8e the first defeat he has ever known.
6829
You would 8e providing the first glimmer of hope to others that some day, he could 8e destroyed.
6829
For now, I'm saying that we should get going soon, if you would like to meet the others 8efore you wake up.
6829
Is there anything else you wanted to show me 8efore we go?
6829
I didn't mean to get us sidetracked like that.
6829
They are from someone else's memory.
6829
Ha ha. No!
6829
Not anymore.
6830
This way!
6830
It was my planet.
6830
Yep!
6830
Jake, it wouldn't work 8etween us.
6830
I'm dead.
6830
Perhaps if you died too.
6830
Although, may8e not after too long?
6830
I don't know how I would feel a8out that if you were a lot older than me.
6830
Although technically I am already so much "older" than you........
6830
It would just 8e kind of strange if you were physically my senior 8y any significant margin, you know?
6830
What?
6830
8ut I wouldn't want that to happen.
6830
For you to die soon.
6830
I want you to succeed at your quest, and to live a long and happy life!
6830
::::?
6830
:::;)
6830
Her? Who?
6830
Me?
6831
I've gathered a small group of travelers for a meeting.
6831
They are 8riefly passing through this 8u88le. I was hoping we could introduce ourselves to one another, and help orient an old friend of mine to the afterlife.
6831
She was supposed to 8e the empress of all trolls, actually.
6831
Not exactly, since she pro8a8ly never would have 8een regardless.
6831
She didn't want the jo8.
6831
Remem8er how I said each class had a duty to take care of the younger and more populous classes lower on the order?
6831
Well, hers was the highest of all.
6831
She was the only one on the planet with such royal 8lood, aside from the sitting empress.
6831
As the heiress, she was meant for a position of incredi8le responsi8ility.
6831
Once she claimed the throne, she would have to serve for many thousands of years, until the next successor was ready.
6831
She had some pro8lems with authority.
6831
She despised the whole social order, really.
6831
I foolishly tried to convince her to honor her o8ligation, 8ut she wouldn't listen.
6831
She viewed the empress as a glorified slave.
6831
So she a8dicated, and fled to the moon to hide.
6831
I was the only one who knew of her plans. The rest of the world searched 8ut never found her.
6831
At the time, I was furious with her. 8ut I didn't turn her in.
6831
Which in retrospect was a key decision that led us here.
6831
Yes, eventually.
6831
While she was there, she discovered an ancient device.
6831
Inside the device was a game.
6831
She 8ecame o8sessed with playing it, 8ut needed our friends to agree to play first.
6831
She was not well liked 8y the others though. Old grudges and rivalries made it hard to convince them.
6831
8ut she is very devious, and knows how to trick people into doing what she wants.
6831
She even got me to agree, 8y promising she'd return to her place as the heiress when we finished playing.
6831
Needless to say, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into.
6831
Yes.
6831
She's not all that 8ad though.
6831
Well........
6831
When you really get to know her.
6831
And when she's unarmed.
6831
Which is........ pretty much never, now that I think a8out it.
6831
Ok, she pro8a8ly is all that 8ad.
6831
The point is, you have to know how to handle her.
6831
Regal types can 8e very touchy, even the ones who seem to revel in anarchy.
6831
8ut if you know all the right things to say and do, she will happily hand over the keys to the kingdom, so to speak.
6831
After all, royalty is royalty.
6831
Just let me do the talking for a while, ok?
6883
WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE DOING????????
6884
Stop it, all of you!
6884
You couldn't even wait a few minutes while I retrieved one last guest?
6884
I have to come 8ack to THIS????????
6884
Every8ody?
6884
Excuse me, are you listening?! I would like to introduce you to someone.
6884
His name is........
6884
HEY!!!!!!!!
6884
MEENAH! I SAID CUT IT THE FUCK OUT.
6884
Yes! you!
6884
The dead miscreant with the goggles waving around the stupid trident.
6884
Put it down!
6884
Yes way.
6884
Put it down.
6884
I'm serious.
6884
I said drop it.
6884
Yes on the floor!
6885
Now step away from it. That's right.
6885
8ack. A little further.
6885
I said further!
6885
No, not closer! Further!
6885
Uuuuuuuugh.
6885
Guess what! You just lost your poking privileges.
6885
I think I'll hang on to this for a little while. How do you like that?
6885
Ooooooooh. It sure is pretty. Is that real gold? Or, pardon me, "reel."
6885
I 8et I could sell it for a small fortune.
6885
Watch me!
6886
Ok then!
6886
Has everyone settled down? Do I have everyone's attention?
6886
Just stop. Please?
6886
I know it's only 8een minutes since you died, and you pro8a8ly aren't thrilled to see me for any num8er of reasons.
6886
8ut for me it has 8een millenia! I have 8een waiting a long time to see you again, and orient you to the afterlife.
6886
Excuse me for looking forward to our reunion then! I guess I 8uilt it up in my mind as something special for a whole lot of nothing!
6886
Then you don't care at all, is that it? My waiting here all this time to see you means nothing?
6886
????????
6886
What is even your point!
6886
I think I have completely forgotten the su8tle art of determining whether you're 8eing sincere, through your tangled fishnet of aquatic puns and little sta8s of hostility.
6886
Do you think you can at least remain well mannered while I 8ring the others up to speed on some critical matters?
6886
Grrrrrrrr.
6886
That's it. I'm selling off this gaudy trinket.
6886
I have developed an eye for priceless treasure.
6886
Do you have any idea who I grew up to 8e in the new world we made?
6886
I'd wager if I put it on the 8lack market, it would fetch a fee to the tuna several 8illion 8oonies.
6887
No.
6890
May8e I should just start over from the 8eginning.
6890
Meenah, please!
6890
Our nice new friends have missed some very IMPORTANT DETAILS!
6890
Very well.
6890
If you speak for everyone with respect to what is most interesting to talk a8out, then what is your porpoisal?
6890
I mean proposal!
6890
(Stupid infectious fish puns.)
6890
(Took all of five minutes to pull me into your insmanatee again.)
6890
(Insanity! Ugh.)
6890
Oh, sure!
6890
You wanted to know how we all died.
6890
That's a pretty interesting story, don't you think, Meenah? :::;)
6890
However, I don't think much of it will make sense without some major contextualization.
6890
There's really quite an amazing amount of nuance to the full sequence of events. Many different players, personalities, conflicting agendas, all interwoven together.
6890
I'll need a little time to set the stage for everything to 8e comprehensi8le, if you all don't mind indulging me for a while.
6890
You could say it all started during our darkest hour, when it 8ecame clear our failure was inevita8le. I took it upon myself to venture into the palace of my denizUMPH.
6891
MMMMMMMMPH!!!!!!!!
6900
Meempha.
6901
Thap waf.......
6902
THE WORST STORY THAT HAS EVER 8EEN TOLD IN THE HISTORY OF PARADOX SPACE.
6902
No! I will not "clam down." Clamming is not something you can do, unless you do it UP, or you are literally retrieving clams from a 8ed of soft oceanic soil.
6902
You just have no respect for a well told story.
6902
Only 8arely!!!!!!!!
6902
You left out so much! All the intrigue, the complicated interpersonal relationships, the 8ackstory, the responsi8le pacing.
6902
Where was the WORLD 8UILDING, Meenah?
6902
Ok! I think I finally understand the art of storytelling now, thanks to you!
6902
It turns out all you have to do is make series of short, mysterious statements without supplying context or any further ela8oration.
6902
It's all so simple! Let's try it out.
6902
Did you know that "what's his face" Vantas in our post-scratch world grew up to 8e a spiritual leader followed 8y millions?
6902
They killed him though. He died handcuffed to something, while shouting a rude word. The end!
6902
Leijon grew up to 8e his m8sprit! She wrote stuff down and spent a long time in a cave. That's that.
6902
Their 8uddy Captor flew a ship for some hag. It wasn't a very cool gig. Maryam found a wiggler and died a slave. Did I mention our planet 8ecame kind of a shithole? No, I don't think I did, 8ecause that's apparently not how you "tell stories."
6902
Zahhak 8uilt me a ro8otic arm. He was ordered 8y a high8lood to kill a girl 8ut he couldn't do it, and was 8anished. Really 8eat himself up over that. 8ut it's ok 8ecause his descendant redeemed the honor of his legacy 8y doing whatever a murderous clown told him to. Wait, was that too much detail? Forget I said some of that. Moving on!
6902
Ampora was a pirate. No8ody liked him. He killed a lot of people, 8ut was later executed 8ecause he was una8le to tell a funny joke. What else needs to 8e said? That's right. Nothing.
6902
Makara was the guy who didn't like his joke. He was terri8le and so is his story. Period.
6902
Nitram was a hero who led a re8ellion. He killed me. 8ut not 8efore things got pretty steamy 8etween us. Want to hear the juicy details? You're out of luck!!!!!!!!
6902
Pyrope cut off my arm and arrested me, 8ut I killed her. This triggered a karmic cycle of revenge which led to the eventual 8linding of her descendant.
6902
Sorry, Terezi. Them's the 8r8ks!
6902
As for me, well, I could go on ALL DAAAAAAAAY a8out that su8ject. 8ut I won't!
6902
I was a cool pir8te. The 8est pir8! I lived a long time, had amazing adventures, got all the treasure, then died. That's all she wrote!
6902
8ut not literally. She wrote quite a lot in fact. She had a lot to say, just like me. Which is why she's so gr8.
6902
Let's see. Who am I forgetting here?
6902
Oh, of course. Megido! Now there's an interesting story full of exciting twists and turns we won't 8e getting into.
6902
She was kidnapped as a child 8y a creep, then served the creep's 8oss for millions of sweeps. She helped make everything lousy. Then you killed her and took her jo8.
6902
Anyway, I think this tedious tale has gone on for entirely too long already!
6902
I can't think of a single thing left to address that could possi8ly 8e of interest to anyone.
6902
Why, Meenah. Could it 8e that you would like to hear more?
6902
I must 8e imagining things, 8ecause you are on record as finding my stories 8oring.
6902
Very well. You would like to know a8out your post-scratch adult life.
6902
Would you like the short version? Or the long version?
6902
You tell me.
6902
Very well.
6902
I shall strive to convey your story, including details which you are likely to find interesting on account of vanity, whilst attempting to refrain from going "Full Serket" on you and other hapless 8ystanders.
6902
Fine.
6902
You want the a8ridged-version, 8ut-may8e-not-so-a8ridged, as-long-as-the-stuff-that-you-in-particular-would-like-to-hear-is-included, of the Meenah Peixes saga?
6902
Here we go.
6903
Instead of storming off to the moon in a huff, Peixes em8raced her role as an heiress.
6903
Once she reached the age to challenge the empress, she killed her predecessor easily.
6903
She did more to sink our race into perpetual darkness and violence than any empress before her, and her rule lasted the longest 8y far.
6903
She conquered thousands of planets and star systems, many of them personally. She was responsi8le for the death of trillions.
6903
Her reign was interrupted only 8y the extinction of our race, which was orchestrated 8y the omniscient creep I mentioned previously.
6903
She flew back to her homeworld, killed Megido, and assumed control of her demonic powers.
6903
In doing so, she also assumed her role as the servant to an indestructi8le demon, whose existence was a8out to result in the annihilation of our universe.
6903
8ut 8efore that, he had a new assignment for her.
6903
Is this 8rief enough? Am I addressing all the "cool stuff" to your satisfaction?
6903
That's the first half of her story.
6903
In the second half, she escaped to a fresh universe to wreak more havoc.
6903
She infiltrated a planet called Earth, which is home to a race called humans. These guys here.
6903
On the post-scratch version of Earth (long story), she gained a8solute power, flooded the planet, and completely wiped out the human population, while expanding her a8ilities even further.
6903
She then somehow entered the humans' game session, and took control there as well.
6903
She did all this at the 8ehest of her employer, and has shown no signs of slowing her rampage, or ever dying, for that matter.
6903
So, Meenah. How was that story? Are you 8ored yet?
6905
Jake, no! What are you doing????????
6906
Jake, stop!
6907
No, no, Jake, that was in another universe! Or, I mean........
6907
She isn't the same person though! I mean, she is, 8ut........
6907
She won't grow up to do any of that! She's the pre-scratch version who.......
6907
You see, the 8atterwitch you're talking a8out was a totally different, uh........
6907
Augh, why does this all have to 8e so complicated to explain!!!!!!!!
6909
Jake, stop whaling on her like that!
6909
I mean, wailing!
6909
W8! Why am I even correcting myself? Those are homonyms!
6909
No8ody could even tell which kind of whaling I meant!
6909
Jake!
6909
I SAID.
6909
ST8P!!!!!!!!
6910
Sigh.
6910
Meenah, are you ok?
6911
Meenah?
7851
Meenah, put the trident down.
7851
Don't make me conchfishscate it again.
7854
(STOPIT!)
7854
Aranea. ::::)
7857
I must admit, I was not in favor of the idea at first.
7857
8ut Vriska made a very strong case for using our com8ined powers in this way.
7857
In a perfect reality, no one would have to get hurt. 8ut the stakes are too high to 8e shying away from such measures.
7857
It has 8een wonderful spending so much time on this adventure with my descendant.
7857
Not just 8ecause it's helped me get to know her 8etter, 8ut 8ecause it's opened my eyes to things a8out myself I was never really in touch with.
7857
There are certain capa8ilities within me I have never quite 8een a8le to face, and she's helped me realize I've 8een hiding from them all my life, and well 8eyond.
7857
It must 8e true what they used to say on my world. That if you really want to know who you are, look to the legacy left 8ehind 8y your ancestor.
7857
I think that wisdom works in 8oth directions!
7857
There's no reason to 8e jealous, Meenah. You know nothing has changed a8out our friendship.
7858
It is true. To a human, the ways of trolls from 8oth Alternia and 8eforus will seem very strange.
7858
In fact, prior to uniting in the afterlife, even the two groups of trolls were reasona8ly alien to one another.
7858
I've had a gr8 deal of time to study the cultures of many species throughout paradox space. No matter which race you 8elong to, one can always find another whose ideals pose a challenge of comprehension to even the most open minded.
7858
And though the ethical standards of those from Alternia may seem unpalata8le to you, rest assured there are 8eings elsewhere in the cosmos whose violent 8ehavior would 8e considered extreme even to most trolls.
7859
Actually John, I'm very glad you 8rought this up.
7859
8ecause I was in the middle of a wonderful story a8out this very su8ject, which you interrupted when you 8oarded our ship.
7859
No, that's fine!
7859
Really, I'm quite pleased that you did.
7859
This way I get to start over from the 8eginning!
7860
There were some rough patches in my original telling which I can go 8ack and fix.
7860
This time it will 8e much 8etter!
7860
It is a tale a8out a very mysterious alien race called cheru8s.
7860
Let us 8egin.
7860
Once upon a time........
7861
There was a very mysterious alien race called cheru8s!
7861
The opening line is fine!
7861
Oh shut up and let me tell my story.
7861
Now where was I?
7861
Right.
7861
There was a very mysterious alien race called cheru8s.
7861
8ut there was one cheru8 in particular who, for at least the first half of our story, will 8e our heroine.
7862
She spent eons roaming her galaxy, completely alone. 8ut the time had come for her to find a m8.
7877
Hey!!!!!!!!
7877
Meenah, where are you going?
7877
8ut the story isn't over yet!
7878
No, that's ok. We can w8!
7878
Not all of it!
7879
I'm afraid not. Everyone must listen to the full story.
7879
Yes! ::::D
7879
As soon as Meenah returns from her visit to the load gaper.
7880
I think we could all stand to take a 8rief intermission from the story regardless, to let all these intriguing facts a8out cheru8s sink in.
7880
Yes, Meenah. You are correct, and your reserv8tions are noted.
7880
However, would it change your mind if I were to propose not an intermission, 8ut........
7880
An interfishin?
7880
;;;;)
7882
Anyway, where was I?
7882
Yes, that's right.
7882
It is with the predomin8tion of her son that our heroine's story ends, and the story of our villain 8egins.
7883
8ut as we all know, 8eginnings are not always so easy to pinpoint in paradox space.
7883
One could say his story 8egan the day he claimed immortality. Or the moment his 8eing was inexplica8ly confined to a juju, allowing him access to any realm in which his vessel would capriciously materialize.
7883
8ut for the sake of linearity, we may as well say his story 8egan the day he and his sister hatched.
7884
When a cheru8 hatches, the two undeveloped personalities mingle together in the same 8ody. There is not yet a clear division 8etween the two.
7884
It will then consume the egg shell for the vital nutrients it contains. The sugary snack is irresisti8le to the starving wiggler.
7884
Once it finishes its first meal, the two personalities will 8e pulled apart for good, and the child will pup8.
7884
The two halves then 8egin vacill8ting with their sleep cycles, as I descri8ed.
7885
As you might expect, the female child was as cheerful and friendly as could 8e.
7886
She took after her mother in every way. At least, the way her mother used to 8e, long 8efore she was hardened 8y centuries of isol8tion and o8sessive pursuit of justice.
7887
And to just as little surprise, the male child was an insuffera8le 8rat.
7888
It is just as well that cheru8 parents a8andon their offspring. Raising such a child 8y the familial standards of any race would 8e a monumental challenge.
7889
Nevertheless, it would seem there were those who tried.
7889
Details in my research suggest our villain had a num8er of acolytes oper8ting in the shadows, preparing for his arrival.
7889
We will pro8a8ly never know who these scurrilous conspir8tors were. 8ut it is evident that at some point the cheru8 was locked in a room, either out of exasper8tion, or for its own good, until it was old enough to enter the session.
7890
The children were left with everything a young cheru8 could ever want. Meat, candy, computers, a lifetime supply of special stardust, and of course their precious jujus.
7890
The acolytes had clearly gone to gr8 lengths to harvest such items from all over the cosmos, so they could lavish their young master with gifts.
7890
They may have 8een prisoners, yes. 8ut if you ask me, these children were very spoiled.
7891
While the female was preparing for a colla8or8tive approach to the game, the male was plotting furiously against her. He never had any intention of working with her.
7891
As far as he was concerned, the game was his and his alone to conquer.
7892
One day, he put his plan into motion. He had his sister's dream self assassin8ted on Prospit.
7892
The next time she went to sleep, she would never wake up again. When her 8rother woke up, he 8ecame the sole occupant of the 8ody.
7892
He then freed himself from his chains, and launched the session 8y himself.
7893
8ut this game was never meant to 8e played solo.
7893
Its format is inherently cooper8tive. The diversity of players, the com8in8tion of their efforts and aspects, this is what awakens the true cre8tive potential of the game. Without them, a session will wither and die.
7893
If one enters alone, it completely alters the nature of the game. It changes its purpose.
7893
For a solo player, a challenging quest 8ecomes an insurmounta8le one. A reward of infinite promise 8ecomes a 8oon far more sinister.
7893
The gauntlet which the player must overcome is seemingly designed to 8e impossi8le. For all intents and purposes, it is not actually a game at all. It is a death sentence for any player foolish enough to accept the challenge.
7893
8ut it 8ears repeating.
7893
This was very special cheru8.
7894
He entered what is called a dead session.
7894
This qualifies as 8oth a null and void session, 8ut is even less than either of those. Compared to a typical session, it is almost unrecogniza8le.
7894
8efore the game 8egins, Skaia is 8lotted out with a dark layer of clouds. Its light is extinguished for good.
7894
There is no planet w8ting for the player in the medium.
7894
So instead, he 8rought it with him.
7895
8ut when he arrived, there was no heroic journey for him to em8ark on.
7895
There was nothing. No sprite, no consorts, no underlings.
7895
The land had no name.
7895
Those things all needed to 8e unlocked.
7895
To unlock his true quest, he was forced to undergo a series of excruci8tingly tedious trials.
7895
Only then would the way to the planet's core 8e revealed. There, he would consult with the most monstrous denizen of all.
7895
And while such trials might discourage most players from even trying, our villain's response was quite the contrary.
7895
He was only em8oldened 8y the mind num8ing chores. He took to them with gusto, as if performing them out of spite.
7896
With perseverance, he found the final door and unlocked it.
7896
W8ting for him on the other side was a terri8le creature named Yalda8aoth.
7896
His denizen would allow him a 8rief audience. One just long enough for him to make The Choice.
7897
No denizen has ever 8een mistaken for pleasant company. 8ut the self-proclaimed god of all monsters is notoriously inhospita8le to his players.
7897
His choices are known for their wild extremes.
7897
And to this player, in this session, he offered his most extreme choice of all.
7897
It was the choice 8etween a path of conquest, and a path of sacrifice.
7897
8ut this is putting it lightly.
7897
In a tongue only his player could understand, he descri8ed what the path of the martyr entailed.
7897
In short, it involved nothing.
7897
The player chooses to walk away from the tempt8tion of power. To surrender all am8ition, and to welcome death.
7897
In exchange for this pledge comes a promise. The player's sacrifice is assured to 8enefit all who will ever live.
7897
In death, the player would later 8e in the position to help 8ring an end to a force of unfathoma8le evil and destruction.
7897
A force which was unleashed, for instance, 8y someone who once opted for the other choice.
7897
Yalda8aoth then descri8ed what it meant to choose the path of the conqueror.
7897
It was a path for a more active player, to 8e sure. The player's mettle as a conquering force would 8e tested directly, and repeatedly.
7897
One 8y one, he would have to conquer and destroy a num8er of planets spawned for him in the session. Each would 8e more difficult than the last.
7897
After destroying them all, his true land would 8ecome unlocked.
7897
He would then return to face his denizen again, and defeat him in com8at.
7897
If successful, his reward would 8e unprecedented.
7897
He would receive the 8oon of unconditional immortality, where resurrection would not 8e linked with the just or heroic nature of death.
7897
It is unclear how this 8oon would 8e awarded, since to my knowledge it is 8eyond even the a8ility of a denizen to allow this.
7897
8ut through whatever mechanism the 8oon is 8estowed, immortality is only the 8eginning.
7897
The player is somehow also im8ued with a limitless supply of power. Enough to destroy anything he wanted, for as long as he wanted.
7897
And knowing the villain of our story, anything he wanted would be everything. And as long as he wanted would be forever.
7897
Yes, knowing our villain, the choice he would make is quite clear.
7897
Knowing him, in fact, proves it could hardly 8e considered a choice at all.
7898
It was at this point the real game would 8egin.
7898
Skaia would undergo a dramatic transform8tion, 8ecoming even darker and heavier.
7899
Soon it would 8ecome a very massive solid sphere. It would 8egin to gener8 heat within due to rising density.
7899
The surface would 8egin to crack.
7900
The resulting explosion is known as the First 8r8k.
7900
From the primordial 8last would emerge fifteen planets for the player to conquer.
7900
They would scatter and ricochet at high velocity 8efore settling into or8it in the medium.
7900
The 8r8k is a very violent phenomenon though. Not all planets will necessarily clear the 8last 8efore the Skaian de8ris settles into its final st8.
7901
The vast amount of resulting matter then collapses into a 8lack hole.
7901
Its gravit8tional pull is tremendous. Any o8ject within range will 8e sucked in and destroyed.
7901
Those planets which settle into or8it will 8e safe, for the time 8eing.
7901
8ut in the case of our villain's session, three of the planets did not make it and fell 8ack into the hole.
7901
This was a very lucky 8r8k for him!
7902
It meant that he would only have to conquer twelve planets instead.
7902
This 8it of good fortune could very well have 8een the difference which allowed him to overcome a nearly impossi8le challenge.
7902
His task was to destroy all of these planets in order, each within a time allowance that gets shorter with every planet.
7902
To destroy a planet, first it must 8e conquered.
7902
He would have to overcome all forces of resistance on the planet, and ultim8tely defeat whatever powerful underling ruled there.
7902
Then, much like he did to unlock the quest in the first place, he would have to travel to the planet's core.
7902
There he would retrieve a 8om8, and return to the surface.
7902
If he did not accomplish this in time, the 8om8 would deton8 in the core, and the game would 8e lost automatically.
7902
The 8om8 is not powerful enough to destroy the planet alone.
7902
In fact, its purpose is not to damage the planet at all, 8ut to move it.
7903
So he must 8ring it to a design8ted loc8tion on the surface.
7903
When it explodes, the planet will 8e knocked out of or8it, and sucked into the hole.
7903
Of course he must make sure he has moved on to the next planet 8efore this happens!
7904
He repeats this process for each planet until they are all gone.
7904
There is one caveat though. He must skip the eighth planet.
7904
If he sinks that one 8efore any of the others, it will result in the destruction of the entire session.
7904
Thus it must 8e the final planet he conquers.
7905
Upon destroying the eighth planet, his true land will reveal itself.
7905
The dead planet will come to life, and there he must prepare for 8attle with his denizen.
7905
He may sharpen his com8at skills, craft new weaponry, anything he can do to improve his chances against a very powerful endgame foe.
7905
Fortun8tely for him, he would not have to face the monster alone.
7905
8y then he will have accumul8ted a party of loyal minions.
7906
With each planet he destroys, he will 8e awarded a new leprechaun follower.
7906
Even if a planet was destroyed in the 8r8k, he will still 8e awarded that planet's leprechaun upon destroying the planet preceding it. Sort of like a two for one deal!
7906
Yes, John!
7906
I'm delighted to see you have pounced on what is clearly the most interesting part of the story thus far.
7906
Leprechauns are a fascin8ting mythical race, although there is some dispute among scholars as to whether they are actually a 8reed of gnome.
7906
I can't say I 8lame you for 8eing speechless. There are no dou8t hundreds of questions swirling in your head at once a8out these wonderful creatures.
7906
Where do I even 8egin? You must forgive me, I find it very difficult to resist going on at length a8out them. I just think they are so gr8.
7906
For instance, I can and have given lectures for weeks at a time on their marvelous and widely varying magical a8ilities.
7906
More intriguing yet would 8e any medium-to-longform harangue on the topic of their culture and customs, most of which revolve around luck.
7906
8ut most captiv8ting of all, and the su8ject upon which I will now assiduously expound, would 8e the positively scintill8ting su8ject of leprechaun romance.
7907
The pro8lem is that when the su8ject of leprechaun romance is 8roached, our overly o8essive troll intellects instantly assume the most ingrati8ting posture of admir8tion imagina8le.
7907
Which makes it hard! Hard to give it proper academic focus I mean, 8ecause of how gr8 it is.
7907
8ut we will do our 8est to understand regardless.
7907
Trolls have only four forms of romance. And though we consider it a complic8ted su8ject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implic8tions for reproduction, it is ultim8tely a superficial slice of what leprechauns consider the full 8ody of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, quaternary concept. A concept usually denoted 8y four sym8ols.
7907
<3 <3< <> o8<
7907
Leprechaun romance is more complic8ted than that. Leprechaun romance needs nine sym8ols.
7907
The nine quadrants of leprechaun romance are considera8ly more nuanced than our quaint notions of romance, and certainly more alien.
7907
In fact, so conditioned is my own understanding of romance that I can't help 8ut refer to them as quadrants, when in fact they are not quadrants at all! They are referred to as charms.
7907
One of the charms is characterized 8y romantic love, as understood 8y 8oth trolls and humans. 8ut after that, all 8ets are off. There is no division 8etween 8lack or red, concupiscent or conciliatory. Instead their charms comprise a spectral continuum of more su8tly varying types of relationships, most of which are esta8lished in mutual chicanery, such as the exchange of pranks, coy riddles, slapstick shenanigans, and games of chance. Furthermore, a pair of leprechauns is not limited to a single charm. A relationship may 8e defined 8y multiple charms at once! In fact, some of the most interesting relationships arise from exotic charm com8in8tions. A sta8le relationship consisting of three or more charms is called a trove. These advanced relationships are often viewed as the ideal end result for a romance, much the way certain pairing rituals are for humans.
7907
No charm is specifically tied to procre8tion, though any type of relationship could 8egin waxing concupiscent if lady luck should so decide. Certain charm com8in8tions are known to 8e more conducive to fertility than others. If the leprechaun pair has 8een so 8lessed, they will 8egin an ela8orate coupling procedure culmin8ting in a lively m8ting jig. The jigs are specific to the charms of course, similar to how different kinds of music lend themselves to various styles of dance.
7907
While their romance is endlessly captiv8ting, leprechaun reproduction may 8e the most interesting su8ject of all. Particularly from a perspective of detailed anatomical study, which I will get to shortly. 8ut first it 8ears pointing out that while for humans reproductive relationships are exclusively heterosexual, and for trolls they are 8isexual, for leprechauns they-
7907
8ut I wasn't fin-
7908
Hmm.
7908
You really liked it that much, Vriska?
7908
Wow. Well, I would 8e happy to continue then, if you-
7908
Aw, you're welcome!
7908
I feel the exact same way a8out my time with you.
7908
You have really helped me get in touch with the true pir8 within. I saw in you the adventurous spirit I always wished I could 8e.
7908
You helped me finally understand the virtue in rationalizing questiona8le decisions, and 8ehaving unscrupulously for the gr8ter good!
7908
::::)
7931
Yes, please come! I was a8out to 8egin one final story 8efore we reach the treasure!
7932
Thank you for joining us, John.
7932
Commodore Nepeta and Rear Admiral Feferi have 8oth 8een clamoring for one last tale, and I am not one to disappoint.
7932
Nope! Although I would 8e happy to tell you all a8out those topics another time.
7932
This is a story a8out two legendary rings.
7933
No, not those rings!
7933
The rings I am talking a8out are less powerful, and considera8ly more o8scure.
7933
8ut for what they lack in power, they make up for in mystery!
7933
Details on the rings are quite hard to come 8y. I have pieced together what little I know from various fa8les and myths.
7933
They occasionally make appearances in such stories, serving different purposes in each tale, and always called 8y different names.
7933
8ut in this story, they will 8e known as the Rings of Life and Void.
7934
The rings are said to look nearly identical.
7934
8ut their powers are quite different, as are their origins.
7934
The Ring of Void supposedly once 8elonged to the 8lack queen of a void session.
7934
8ut one day it was stolen from her 8y a thief. And then stolen again from the thief 8y a rogue.
7934
Legend would suggest it changed hands like this for a long time thereafter, until finally vanishing into the void itself forever.
7934
Which is fitting, as the ring grants its wearer the a8ility to do exactly the same!
7934
The Ring of Life has a very different story.
7934
I have found no reports of an origin to this ring at all. Like many magic artifacts, it may not even have one which is comprehensi8le.
7934
Earliest reports I have read would suggest it was first discovered 8y some travelers in a desert, and like its sister ring, has changed hands repeatedly since.
7934
This ring however has a dramatically different effect. Instead of releg8ting the wearer to o8scurity and immateriality, it does just the opposite.
7934
It is said that any ghost who wears this ring will come 8ack to life!
7934
In some stories, the f8 of each ring appears to 8e entangled with the other. When one is lost, the other is serendipitously found.
7934
A gr8 example of this can 8e o8served in the fa8le of-
7935
8ut I was just a8out to tellmph-
7935
::::?
7945
Vriska, I am on your side here. 8ut I feel I should point out that technically they 8oth outrank you.
7945
8y 8eing a commodore?
7945
Yes, and a rear admiral outranks a commodore.
7982
::::?
7990
...
8444
Rise, my 8ard.
8445
"Rise, my 8ard?"
8445
Sheesh.
8446
Aranea, if you want people to start taking you seriously, your chilling repartee is going to need some work.
8449
Now, loyal minstrel.
8449
Wake!
8449
WAKE, I SAY!!!!!!!!
8451
OOF!
8452
Just gr8.
8452
What does she want THIS time?
8453
Shello?
8453
I have no idea what you're talking a8out.
8453
I couldn't say, Meenah.
8453
I do like to wear jewelry from time to time, just like you.
8453
It's certainly possi8le there is a shiny new ring on my finger.
8453
So what if there is?
8453
First, I would appreci8 it if you referred to me as Mindfang.
8453
Remem8er how I've 8een trying to make that 8e a thing l8tely?
8453
Second, I have no intention of discarding this ring, now or ever.
8453
Wheels are already in motion, Meenah.
8453
Irons are heating up as we speak!
8453
I am just taking some initi8tive for a change.
8453
Has it occurred to you that it might have 8ecome a little tiresome for me to spend eternity as a 8oring no8ody while so many others got to play important roles in determining the f8 of reality?
8453
Heck, you were 8arely dead for two minutes 8efore you started assem8ling an army!
8453
Even my altern8 universe self got to lead an amazing life. Which is all well and good for HER........
8453
8ut what a8out ME, Meenah?
8453
Water. 8oat. Me.
8453
Of course I know that.
8453
Like I said, I have a plan.
8453
I'm going to take over this session.
8453
And then I am going to make sure it never 8ears fruit.
8453
If I can stop this universe from 8eing cre8ted, then the young Lord of Time will never have hatched in the first place.
8453
I won't merely 8e defeating an invinci8le foe. I will 8e erasing all the pain he has ever caused.
8453
Of course I know that.
8453
Please, Meenah. Don't insult me. I've given this a lot of thought.
8453
If anyone else attempted this, what you said would 8e true. 8ut I am not just anyone.
8453
I am a very powerful Sylph of Light. I have had millions of sweeps to hone my a8ilities.
8453
As one gifted with the aspect of light, certain outcomes will 8e prone to 8r8king in my favor.
8453
And as an ancient, highly experienced sylph, I wield an unprecedented a8ility to heal.
8453
A doomed timeline is really just an anatomical feature of a much larger organism. Like a capillary which comes to an end, 8ecause it has withered and died.
8453
I 8elieve I will 8e a8le to heal this offshoot.
8453
And with enough time and patience, I am confident I can restore its vitality to such a gr8 extent, it will effectively take over as the alpha timeline, thus reducing English to a lost footnote of paradox space.
8453
Then the new alpha timeline will flourish under my immortal care. I will watch over it for eternity, assuring peace and harmony everywhere. There will 8e a new progeny of universes, and those universes will 8eget more universes, and each will 8enefit from my good grace. I will personally make sure nothing like the English mishap ever occurs again.
8453
I mean, this is mostly theoretical, of course.
8453
8ut the most important thing here is that I am involved now.
8453
It is vital to all our interests that I at least TRY.
8453
I appreci8 the vote of confidence.
8453
Are we a8out done here?
8453
I am aware.
8453
8ut there is no one who is in a 8etter position to deal with her than myself.
8453
After all, who knows you 8etter than I? ::::)
8453
It's like I said.
8453
I've had quite a long time to refine my a8ilities.
8453
I will have a few tricks up my sleeve.
8453
Meenah, I must say your attitude is a little surprising.
8453
I thought you were typically gung ho a8out such audacious escapades?
8453
What a8out you?
8453
I'll miss you too, Meenah.
8453
I really don't know.
8453
When you're trying to do the right thing, there is always sacrifice involved.
8453
Remem8er? That's why we all died in the first place.
8453
8esides. I'm sure Vriska would approve of my plan.
8453
May8e she can explain my reasoning 8etter than I have.
8453
What?
8453
She isn't?
8453
What did she say, exactly?
8453
Were those her exact words?
8453
Is she there with you?
8453
Can you put her on?
8453
Very well.
8453
You have 8oth made yourselves a8undantly clear.
8453
I will go it alone. 8ut that's what I was signing up for in the first place, I suppose.
8453
Good8ye, Meenah. Take care.
8454
Now then.
8454
What to do a8out you?
8454
Shall I continue to manipul8 you? Or will you comply with my orders if I decide to loosen my grip?
8454
Perhaps the threat of 8eing controlled again will 8e enough to keep your capricious tendencies in check?
8454
........
8455
I guess it's a risk.
8455
8ut you seem so serene and compliant.
8455
Alright. I will 8e gracious, and allow you some free will privileges.
8455
Use them wisely, my trusty jongleur.
8457
No.
8458
Oh, wow. No.
8458
You will not ever 8e speaking again. No.
8458
Never, never, never again. Never.
8458
Wow.
8458
And I thought our Makara was awful. At least he had the decency to sew his mouth shut.
8459
Anyway, I have wasted enough time dithering around with fools.
8459
There is much work to 8e done.
8474
JAKE!!!!!!!!
8476
Greetings, Jake.
8476
We meet again.
8476
On the contrary!
8476
You are awake now.
8476
And I, alive.
8476
No, Jake. I have returned from the dead for good.
8476
And I have come for you.
8476
Surely you remem8er the first time we met? And what we talked a8out?
8476
I once spoke of your destiny. The one where8y you will deal the Lord of Time his first defeat. Do you recall?
8476
It doesn't matter. The plan has changed.
8476
Yes, Jake.
8476
You see, in every hero of hope there dwells a gr8 hidden power, unrivaled 8y that of any other aspect.
8476
And for a page, the journey to reach his full potential is longer than it is for any other class.
8476
8ut once that journey is over, how fearsome he 8ecomes!
8477
I am here to shorten that journey for you.
8477
And in return for this favor, you will serve my needs.
8478
There are many o8stacles within that are preventing you from accessing your true potential.
8478
You cannot see them, Jake. 8ut I can.
8478
I can see every fault and fissure in your mind. My vision 8-fold sheds light on every injury you have ever suffered, whether emotional or physical.
8479
I can repair it all for you, Jake.
8480
I can heal your mind.
8481
I can heal your soul.
8482
What's the matter?!
8482
Wow, alright!!!!!!!!
8483
I'm sorry!
8483
There! See?
8483
I am respecting your personal 8oundaries. We don't have to kiss!
8483
Good grief, that went poorly.
8483
I only tried to kiss you 8ecause I knew you were attracted to me!
8483
I thought I was doing you a FAVOR!
8483
I don't know what I'm supposed to........
8483
Sigh.
8483
You really are a piece of work, Jake. Here I am, a literal mind reader, and I still can't figure you out.
8483
8ut you're right.
8483
My advances were inappropri8te, and in the future I will try to 8e more respectful.
8484
I'm still going to heal you though.
8485
It is nothing personal. There is simply no altern8tive.
8486
Your power is too important to my plan!
8507
I don't think he can hear you right now.
8507
The hope field is nigh impenetra8le!
8507
Who. Me?
8507
Oh........
8508
Just some no8ody.
8517
Well?
8517
I thought you said you were going to su8due me.
8517
I'm w8ting, miss Crocker.
8517
Don't worry. I am only 8orrowing him temporarily as an equalizing force.
8517
And once he has finished equalizing, I will tear your empire apart. ::::)
8517
Then it would seem the next move is yours.
8517
I trust your weapon is not just for show.
8517
Or did Her Condescension see fit to equip her heiress with a training fork?
8517
It's no trap, I assure you.
8517
I simply cannot 8e killed.
8517
You see, as long as a certain charm remains in my possession, I am immortal.
8517
Even more immortal than usual!
8517
Yes.
8517
Sadly, no.
8526
Don't listen to her, Jake!
8526
Continue powering up for as long as you like. You're doing wonderfully!
8542
I know that you have a gr8 deal of fondness for your human family mem8er, even though you have 8een corrupted 8y an evil computer.
8542
As such, it sincerely pains me to have to do this.
8542
8ut the moment she wakes up, she will simply 8ecome possessed again.
8542
And then where would we 8e?
8543
Again, I am very sorry.
8543
8ut it must 8e done.
8559
Take your time. I'm not going anywhere. ::::)
8561
Roxy.
8562
I know you are there.
8566
You might as well come out of hiding so I can see you.
8566
Ah yes. There you go!
8566
Don't you look nice. I always did like the rogue outfit. And needless to say, I'm quite partial the void color scheme.
8566
I 8EG your pardon?
8566
Oh.
8566
"Who ARE you."
8566
Yes. Ha ha.
8567
Who am I, you ask?
8567
That is no short story, I'm afraid.
8567
It all 8egan on a peaceful, idyllic planet called 8eforus.
8567
Unlike the Alternian trolls, with whom you are no dou8t more familiar, my people were-
8567
Yes.
8567
What a8out it?
8567
John's ring?
8567
8ut John never rightfully owned it.
8567
In fact, it was originally intended as a gift to my young descendant.
8567
It's only fitting that I wear it, and 8ring additional glory to the Serket name.
8567
Hmm?
8567
Ah yes. The female cheru8.
8567
I am perfectly familiar with her plight, as well as the relevance she purportedly has with respect to her 8rother's downfall.
8567
In fact, I was one of the first ever to theorize a8out that! :::;)
8567
8ut the situ8tion has changed. That is all ancient history now.
8567
I'm sorry, Roxy. 8ut I have no use for your cheru8 friend in my plans.
8567
She will not 8e playing a role of any significance.
8567
Come on, now. Don't say things you can't take 8ack.
8567
I'm actually very nice!
8567
We are just getting off on the wrong foot here.
8567
........
8567
No.
8568
That was quite the 8lack solicit8tion though.
8568
Unfortun8tely, I don't think I will 8e a8le to reciproc8 your feelings of hostility. I find you to 8e too charming.
8568
Still, you do have a way with words. If we were compati8le in that quadrant, you might have swept me off my feet!
8568
8esides, I don't have time for new relationships right now. Too many irons in the fire, as you can see.
8568
It does get to 8e a little 8othersome having people fling themselves at you all the time. It's always 8een my curse.
8568
Did you know just earlier today, your friend Jake could 8arely keep his hands off me? ;;;;)
8568
I've 8een known to em8ellish now and then.
8568
Relax! I am just having some fun with you.
8568
8ut now the fun times are over.
8568
I cannot have an invisi8le, intangi8le trou8lemaker tiptoeing around trying to sneak this ring off my finger.
8568
So I'm afraid I will have to put you down.
8568
Don't 8e so dramatic.
8568
Your 8ody will only 8e napping.
8569
Pleasant dreams.
8591
Where did you come from?
8591
I did not sense your approach.
8591
8n't real?
8591
It seems to me that you are quite real, Dirk.
8591
Hmm.
8591
Honestly, Dirk. The convers8tion we are having right now 8ears a striking resem8lance to a8solute nonsense.
8591
I recall once your dream self appeared out of thin air, just as you have done now.
8591
And I did you the favor of helping you on your way. Don't you remem8er?
8591
There's no need to thank me. I'm quite 8enevolent 8y nature. I prefer to do the right thing, even in situations where I'm not likely to receive credit for my good deeds.
8591
No need to 8e so rude. I'm just curious.
8591
As an ancient and learned scholar, I'm versed in a wide range of unusual phenomena. However I must say I am flummoxed 8y the nature of your 8eing.
8591
What exactly are you?
8604
Those were some nice moves.
8604
I particularly enjoyed how you took a casual swing at my arm in the middle of that com8in8tion.
8604
As if I am not perfectly aware that you understand the significance of this ring.
8604
I know you must have overheard my convers8tion with Roxy.
8604
Really, it is one of the gr8 disadvantages of having a reput8tion for offering detailed explan8tions.
8604
When you inevita8ly start going on at length a8out your weaknesses, there are sure to 8e some eavesdroppers taking notes!
8605
8ut I really don't mind that you know my secret.
8605
What kind of sport would I 8e if I didn't give you a fair shot at defeating me?
8605
In fact, to show you what a generous and honora8le opponent I am, I will give you one free chance at disarming me.
8605
I won't move an inch. I promise! Surely with your speed and swordsmanship, it will 8e a piece of cake.
8605
Well?
8605
Go on, Dirk. Have at it.
8640
Dirk, how long did you want our standoff to last?
8640
Don't get me wrong. I am flattered you seem to enjoy my company so much.
8640
8ut you are missing a golden opportunity to sever my arm while I'm preoccupied with overconfident 8lather.
8641
Really, you would 8e doing me a favor 8y taking my arm.
8641
It would 8ring me that much closer to following in the footsteps of my true self.
8641
She was a very successful pir8, you know. She lost her arm in 8attle to a cunning adversary she underestim8ted, much like yourself.
8641
Won't you help me 8ecome who I was always meant to 8e?
8642
Oh?
8672
Good GRIEF, that was painful.
8746
Oh shit.
