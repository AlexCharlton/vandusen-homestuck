2320
Yes, dear!
2320
Hoo hoo hoo!
2320
Of course, John! I have come back to help you on your journey through The Medium and beyond! I am delighted to see what a fine young man you have turned out to be. Just like your father!
2321
Your father was kidnapped!
2321
When you crossed over to The Medium, he was apprehended by the very forces of darkness which your presence here has awakened.
2321
It is where we are now! A realm that is a ring of pure void, dividing light and darkness. It turns in the thick of The Incipisphere, a place untouched by the flow of time in your universe.
2321
A computer? Why, what is that, dear? Some new fangled contraption, like the horseless auto-boxcar?
2321
Hoo hoo hoo! Of course I know what a computer is, John! I was just pulling your leg! Hoo hoo hoo!
2321
No, John. You are not inside a computer or software or anything like that! Try not to be so linear, dear. The software that brought you here was merely a mechanism that served as a gateway! Its routines in a way served to invoke this realm's instance, yet it stands independently of any physical machine, and somewhat paradoxically, always has!
2321
I think it would be best if we started with the big picture!
2322
Above The Medium, beyond The Seven Gates, residing at the core of The Incipisphere is a place known as Skaia.
2322
Legend holds that Skaia exists as a dormant crucible of unlimited creative potential. What does this mean, you ask? I'm afraid my lips are sealed about that, dear! Hoo hoo!
2322
But needless to say, where a realm of such profound importance is concerned, forces of light will forever be charged with its defense, while forces of darkness will just as persistently covet its destruction!
2323
And as it so happens, at the center of this realm whose fate is in question, these very forces duel on a stage, stuck in eternal stalemate.
2323
Yes, they have dueled in this manner forever... that is, until you showed up!
2324
Yes, you, John!
2324
Before your mishap with my ashes, you may recall the Sprite's previous incarnation, which resulted from its Kernel's "hatching".
2324
You see, this hatching occurs automatically in response to your arrival! The result is a pair of Kernels, one dark, one light, each carrying the information they were prototyped with before the hatch!
2324
One goes down, to a kingdom entrenched in darkness. The other, up, to a kingdom basking in light! Each comes to rest in an Orb atop a Spire, of which there are three others in kind. The Four Spires are situated above a throne, and these two thrones preside over the two respective Sovereign Powers!
2324
And once the Kernels are situated, that is when the game is afoot. The true war begins, light versus dark, good versus evil.
2324
This is a war that the forces of light are always destined to lose, without exception!
2325
That remains for you to find out, dear! For you see, the journey you are about to take is The Ultimate Riddle!
2325
For now, your objective is to proceed towards Skaia, and pass through The First Gate situated directly above your house, not even terribly far! The Gates will become progressively more difficult to reach, so you had better be prepared to sharpen your adventuring skills!
2325
You build!
2326
Yes, John!
2326
Oh no, I'm afraid not!
2327
Your planet is done for, dear! There is nothing you can do about that!
2327
Your purpose is so much more important than saving that silly old planet, though!
2327
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
2328
John, you are such a good boy! I know you will succeed.
2328
You are a good boy, and good boys deserve treats!
2328
I am going to go bake you some cookies.
2785
John, don't forget your book!
2785
It is your birthright! You ought to give it a read when you have a moment. Particularly the first several pages!
2785
Yes, dear?
2785
Yes, of course, John!
2785
But that would not serve your purpose well!
2785
There is a very good reason why you should build up to it. And then keep building!
2785
John, you are a very fresh young man!
2785
Your father has done such a wonderful job raising you. I am so proud of you both.
2785
When you pass through the first gate, everything will change. You will find the place where the constellations dance beneath the clouds. And then your true work may begin.
2785
Hoo hoo hoo!
3329
Yes!
3329
All the gates do, John. To ascend, each time you must first descend!
3329
Until you find the next gate. It is hidden somewhere in the Land.
3329
So you see why you had to build in the first place, John? You must have a little faith in your dear old nanna!
3329
HOO. HOO HOO.
4695
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
4698
Hoo hoo hoo!
4698
John, you remind me so much of your father when he was your age. He was just as easily bested by this crafty old prankstress!
4698
Yes. It would be many years before he would take the gambit in an exchange with your nanna.
4698
Of course I knew this, John! I have known for many years.
4698
I have also known that in a sense, you are my father as well. You were the one to push all those buttons, after all!
4698
John, I am the ghost of an old lady with one arm who is dressed like a clown. Why would that seem strange to me?
4698
I have been looking for you too, dear!
4699
Yes! It seems you have been rising through the rungs of your echeladder quite swiftly.
4699
Yes, that is quite high. You have climbed so much faster than I did in my youth. I am so proud of you!
4699
You should have returned sooner! I could have given you this boon at a much lower rung.
4699
Here, John. Take this.
4700
You can use it to summon me wherever you go.
4700
Now we needn't endure those long spells without a good visit!
4700
And now, the most important question of all.
4700
When was the last time you have eaten anything, young man??
4701
That is completely unacceptable.
4701
I will prepare you a healthy home cooked meal while you relax in your ghost bed and rescue your paradox sister.
4701
What would you like? Name what your heart desires. I will use my spooky ghost powers to make it.
4701
Why, John! Do you hear that sound?
4701
It sounds as if your meal is nearly finished!
4701
BZZZZZ!
4702
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOHOOHOOHOOHOOHOOHOO!
