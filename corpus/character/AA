did y0u set up the teams
yes
i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that
i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that either
n0t really
im 0k with it
im 0k with a l0t 0f things
even 0ur inevitable failure
th0ugh it will briefly masquerade as vict0ry
she was right ab0ut a l0t 0f things
but y0u like t0 talk t0 me
this a fact n0t a questi0n
they t0ld me
why d0 y0u like t0 talk t0 me
ha
ha
0_0
s0llux i actually w0uld like it if you were happy
y0u seem sad and angry all the time
what d0es anger feel like
i f0rg0t
maybe i never was
i feel like i was th0ugh
0nce
i think his anger serves a greater purp0se
its part 0f his destiny and thus 0urs
it will help him t0 sab0tage his 0wn designs
which are very much in 0pp0siti0n t0 the br0ader purp0se
and will s0w the seeds 0f 0ur failure
a failure which will ir0nically pr0ve t0 be missi0n critical
they never lied th0ugh
this is h0w it had t0 be
i have t0 be t0tally h0nest
th0ugh at n0 p0int did i ever lie
but thr0ugh 0missi0n
this game will n0t save the w0rld
and th0ugh it is still very imp0rtant even in 0ur defeat
unf0rtantely it is much cl0ser t0 serving as the instrument 0f 0ur pe0ples demise than that 0f their salvati0n
and we twelve will behave simultane0usly as the pawns and the 0rchestrat0rs of the great und0ing
y0u will th0ugh
it cann0t be st0pped
mete0rs are en r0ute
y0u kn0w this s0llux
y0u were never g0ing t0 be the team leader th0ugh
which is t0 say
the first t0 enter
im c0ming up
0h n0000000
0_0
n0
0r yes
yes theres n0thing
and n0 y0u cant
but y0u sh0uldnt pretend as if y0u believe this has anything t0 d0 with the state 0f my mind
0r the decisi0ns it will make 0r has already made
s0rry i didnt f0ll0w that
0k
thanks
did y0u set up the teams
im c0ming up
0h b0y thats way t00 many of the same letter in a r0w twice
h0w ab0ut
eight eyes
minus seven
i didnt trick him
its n0t like that
i d0nt care
yes
0k well im sure it will be very th0ughtful
uh
the blue team
i havent given it any th0ught
n0r did i think such a thing was up f0r c0nsiderati0n
but if y0u want t0 pretend we b0th have a separate team t0gether
and name that team
then kn0ck y0urself 0ut
0_0
i never think ab0ut that anym0re
its 0k
which l0ser
n0
i didnt exclude him f0r that reas0n
0r at all
y0ure just n0t getting it
y0u never listen
d0nt d0 that its really childish
uh w0w
its 0k
yes we are
n0 im s0rry
y0u cant s0llux
n0t yet
n0 y0ure n0t
trust me
c0me t0 the wind0w
because im 0utside
take a l00k
c0me cl0ser y0ull see me
i pr0mise
c00l!
mine t00
i d0nt kn0w where terezi is th0ugh
shes running late
n0
ill be here cl0uding her campaign f0r her regardless
with 0r with0ut her!
her l0ss if she d0esnt make it
itll give y0u a chance t0 gain s0me gr0und
y0u picked a t0ugh class tavr0s!
n0ne 0f the really useful c0mbat abilities c0me int0 play until y0u reach a very high level
but i supp0se it will be rewarding when y0u get there
i c0uldnt agree m0re
y0u might be the 0nly flarper in the w0rld wh0 really understands the true spirit 0f the game
every0ne else is s0 aggressive and treasure hungry!
but thats what makes beating them all the m0re satisfying
remember y0ur cl0uder isnt g0ing t0 pull any punches t0night
d0nt fall f0r her mind games
ill be here t0 assist 0f c0urse
if y0ure in tr0uble d0nt hesitate t0 ask f0r help
n0 pr0blem!
yes
im dead
my spirit merged with the fr0gsprite
like a gh0st
y0u d0nt s0und dumb
i ign0red the advice 0f a friend
and made s0me bad ch0ices
0k
nepeta can y0u please keep this a secret
thank y0u
ribbit
wh00ps
0k
he cant walk th0ugh
pr0bably never will
n0!
neither he 0r i sh0uld have ever had anything t0 d0 with th0se hateful sn0bs
it was a big mistake
n0 0ffense 0_0
i d0nt see why theyd lift a finger t0 help him
they hate us b0th s0 much
im s0 mad!
im n0t scared 0f her
she cant c0ntr0l me
shes tried it d0esnt w0rk
but it was my fault
i was distracted when i c0uld have helped him
yeah
wh0 was he anyway
what was he d0ing there
watching us
i guess s0
i feel p0werless sitting here d0ing n0thing th0ugh
its like she wins even if y0u get her back!
i guess 0ur gaming days are 0ver then
us f0ur at least
what
id rather n0t talk t0 y0u
im n0t the 0ne y0u sh0uld ap0l0gize t0
n0t falling f0r it
i d0nt see anything 0ut there
what d0 y0u mean
are y0u n0t happy ab0ut that
y0u were ab0ut t0 be killed by his hive
pr0ceeding with that plan w0uldnt have made sense
we certainly d0nt need tw0 dead players
yes it was the plan
it had t0 g0 this way
were we ever really friends
i d0nt remember
it d0esnt matter
ribbit
s0rry
n0
y0ure n0t 0n the blue team
y0u were never g0ing t0 be
its n0t revenge
y0u were always supp0sed t0 be 0n the red team
y0ull believe me later
when y0u wake up
ive never th0ught ab0ut revenge at all
i d0nt care
0_0
s0rry
they need y0u th0ugh
and its where y0u need t0 be
karkat will be in t0uch with y0u s00n
als0 if its any c0ns0lati0n
the teams are meaningless anyway
thats fine
n0
im 0k with it
i d0nt usually receive 0rders fr0m superi0rs 0r 0therwise
but really its fine
what
why
whats wr0ng
ab0ut what
what are y0u talking ab0ut
ive underst00d f0r s0me time that this will be my r0le
t0 functi0n as y0ur server player
and that y0u w0uld be the team leader as the first in the chain
uh
thats n0t quite the meaning 0f the w0rd server
as y0ur server i manipulate y0ur envir0nment t0 help y0u advance
i supp0se s0
what
0_0
y0u really are quite a sn0b
0_0
y0u l00k really agitated
are y0u sure y0ure alright
break s0mething
0h
i think i understand
i like breaking things
i didnt used t0 but n0w i d0
its fun
um
hell0
are y0u sure y0ure 0k
y0u really d0 l00k like y0ure sweating pretty hard
maybe y0u sh0uld break s0mething
t0 try t0 calm d0wn
d0 y0u want me t0 break s0mething
i c0uld break s0mething if y0u want
kind 0f
equius im ab0ut t0 thr0w an abluti0n trap thr0ugh y0ur wall
heads up
it was pretty c00l
what
y0u want me t0 call it a bath tub
that s0unds ridicul0us
fine
what
y0u want me t0 thr0w the trap thr0ugh y0ur wall again
i mean the tub
is that an 0rder
what d0nt y0u kn0w
i really have n0 idea what y0ure talking ab0ut
y0u are s0 weird
and this is c0ming fr0m a gh0st
ribbit
s0rry
0_0
im n0t really r0le playing
im part fr0g
but 0k
i guess i can break s0me m0re stuff
ribbit
i cant really c0ntr0l the ribbits
yeah i kn0w
sure
what
everything y0u say s0unds strange
0k
i d0nt have pupils
fine
yeah sure
thats pretty much h0w it is anyway
i d0nt have bl00d
0_0
w0w uh
can y0u just bring me the r0b0t already
ribbit
what d0 y0u think y0ure d0ing!
just st0p
st0p st0p st0p st0p st0p st0p
maybe if i say st0p en0ugh s0mething else will happen instead 0f the thing that d0es
y0u arent g0ing t0 st0p are y0u
n0 i d0nt care ab0ut that
its y0ur quest t0 tear y0ur sessi0n apart
i kn0w its exciting
breaking stuff
and n0t w0rrying ab0ut it
but there are c0nsequences t0 hum0ring y0ur destructive impulses
and c0nsequences t0 f0ll0wing
what they say
y0u kn0w wh0
i d0nt even need t0 watch y0ur future acti0ns t0 kn0w this
the kn0wing is the same as this elusive feeling 0f sickness thats been with me f0r years
pr0bably since bef0re i died c0me t0 think 0f it
it was always a big setup
n0
i never had 0ne
s0rt 0f a special case here
i just wish
back when i was behaving recklessly
i had s0me0ne t0 tell me t0 st0p listening
even if i ended up ign0ring their advice
it w0uld have been nice
i was assured i w0uld be saving my race
which is maybe still true i d0nt kn0w
but if it is then it will be the punchline t0 the vast j0ke
y0u really d0nt understand anything yet d0 y0u
and yet y0u bug and fuss and meddle
with things m0re danger0us than y0u can imagine
what d0 y0u want with the s0urce 0f the first guardians
what g00d d0 y0u really think c0uld c0me 0f it
y0u cant p0ssibly wield its energy 0r put it t0 c0nstructive use
y0u w0nt find it either
its imp0ssible
n0!
y0u still havent gathered that y0ure the pr0blem
im thr0ugh with c0nsci0usly c0ntributing t0 inevitable 0utc0mes
0bvi0usly
but im just talking
maybe the things i say will indirectly trigger y0ur critical acti0ns
maybe n0t wh0 kn0ws
maybe!!!
maybe if i behave in a manner s0 rand0m
parad0x space w0nt kn0w h0w t0 handle it!
blah BL00P blee BLUH!@#$%^&*()_+
didnt see that 0ne c0ming did y0u pspace??? + ?*rand(413^612)
oh look and now i suddenly refuse to type zeroes in my sentences
isnt that crazy! who thought that was even a possibility
bslick never would have imagined THAT little vestibule of probability was tucked somewhere in his huge glistening blow sack
ribbit ribbit ribbit
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT
I JUST CONTROLLED THE RIBBITS AND I DID IT DELIBERATELY
hahaha!
0h w0w im sure y0u were just being faceti0us with that but y0u have n0 idea h0w funny that is right n0w
y0u had n0 way 0f kn0wing thats a thing i d0 all the time but with zer0es
this is great
i think im 0n t0 s0mething here
maybe if i dig deep en0ugh int0 my circuitry and rer0ute all 0f my reserve p0wer thr0ugh my quantum based rand0m number generat0r i can pr0duce behavi0r s0 c0mpletely 0ff the wall that parad0x space will have n0 ch0ice but t0 change everything!
maybe i will also rig my p0wer s0urce t0 the 0utc0me 0f the functi0n and rand0mly bl0w myself up!
that w0uld be just
really
really
really*rand(rand(rand(rand(rand(0M)*0M)*0M)*0M)*0M) where 0M = s0me number drawn quite at rand0m fr0m 0ne 0f y0ur absurd human hats
!~M~0~D~N~A~R
g00dbye r0se
enj0y y0ur rampant indiscreti0ns
talk t0 y0u later assuming i havent rand0mly bl0wn myself up!
hi
i guess i sh0uld say s0mething
bef0re i g0
i kn0w
but this is hard f0r me
n0 thats n0t true
s0rry ab0ut everything
and all the bad luck y0uve had
y0u didnt deserve it
i have t0 g0 n0w
im n0t sure
anyway thats it
i d0nt kn0w that either
but i guess if y0u d0
pr0bably n0t with y0ur eyes
i think y0ull be 0k with it th0ugh
0_0
i wish
i c0uld s0meh0w make that em0tic0n smile
0u0
n0 that l00ks stupid
0h well
hello!
i think its absurd i never introduced myself to you in all that time i spent moping around the lab
guess i wasnt in a very good mood
hi dave my names aradia
um
6 a girl and a place very close to you
in fact
i could visit you right now if you would like
to be fair it translates to the same age as you which at the moment is 12 is it not
understanding disparities in the flow of time should be easy for people like us let alone understanding disparities in such pedestrian things as units
i am 6 sweeps old one sweep is a little more than 2 years you dummy!
look it is either the truth or i am just someone who is being a bit playful what is the harm in that
:D
i know you arent
but i am
maid of time
whereas you are the knight of the very same cosmic faculty
it would seem we have very little in common dave
when in fact we have very much
yes
thats definitely what you did the first time we had this conversation
so i will wait patiently while you realize thats not what youre going to do this time
dave describe to me why you are now incredulous please
of course you remember that
this is a memory
come to the window
because im outside
take a look
that iiis
becaaause
im not out there anymore!
turn around
yeah
try to remember
are you sure
why indeed!
yes
i think it looks pretty nice but go on
no
sorry
not exactly
yes
yes and no
yes and 2 nos!
it is the afterlife
but what is happening now is taking place in a bubble which is accessible to the living through dreams under the right conditions
and it is also your memory
the entry point for any bubble is always a memory
either a memory of the dead
or a memory of the living dreamer come to visit!
but once you realize it is not just a memory
what happens next is up to you
no this actually did happen
thats because it isnt your memory
this is alpha dave
the one who chose not to take the nap which led to your death
did she
didnt you ask for this
evidently
yes yes and yes
yes it can be on the table and yes reality still means something
and yes your guardian did die
nothing
all is well and as it should be
what would you be doing there if you were him
even better!
would you be upset
then maybe what you are doing is grieving
in whatever way that comes naturally to you
you are lucky to be able to
i could not for a long time
but now that i can again im so relieved
because i have discovered there is no reason to grieve!
looks like it
who do you suspect you would be talking to in this situation
maybe she is helping you through this
you were helping her werent you
i think so
the living need each others help
just like the dead do
alpha dave still has a long way to go
hes still not at ease with his mortality
but people like us have to be!
we have to be prepared to die a thousand deaths before our quest is complete
the master we serve demands it
pretty much
they come here too
in their own bubbles
you may cross paths with them if you wish
ha
i know the feeling :)
im not showing you im just visiting your bubble
it projects your thoughts and memories
as well as other things relevant to you much like the clouds do in skaia
nothing
none of this is your business anymore
its time to move on
oh look this was my hive!
before it was destroyed
what did you picture
thats very silly and a little perverse
but actually that sounds like what it might have been like on some parts of the planet sooo
ill put in a good word with your bubble about it
i dont know about hauntoffs
but there is plenty of time to satisfy various curiosities you might have about existence and whatnot
is it
oh! yes
there are all sorts of friends to meet
ones you already know and ones you dont
there is plenty of time for just about anything
lots and lots of time
enough time to understand that time isnt much of anything at all
time is like a game
just one fun game in realitys cupboard which is full of them
its the one we are the best at!
while other people are better at the other games
but when all the games are back in the cupboard everyone is about the same
and games are fun but sometimes you dont realize how much fun you were having until theyre all over
and sometimes you look back and realize for some stupid reason you werent having any fun at all!
then you laugh
that laugh will suffice
hey!
want to see inside my hive
it is quite possible and more than ok
it seems you have a hiveguest dave
tavros has been looking forward to meeting you
yes you figured out the mystery!
you may think so but then again you have not faced team charge in a match of slam poetry have you
just kidding im no good at slam poetry haha sorry
yes hes dead
no i am wide awake
and i physically stand before you in person!
oh no
i am very much alive
and i intend to stay that way :)
s0llux!
y0u will never guess what i just f0und
i d0ubt it
um
yes
h0w did y0u kn0w!
yeah
me t00
what d0 y0u think it means?
i d0nt kn0w maybe
maybe y0urs are t00?
wait
yes
shes very quiet th0ugh i cant tell what shes saying!
g00d idea
0k d0 y0u remember what we talked ab0ut regarding kanayas ruins?
i asked y0u f0r help in understanding the glyphs
0_0
are y0u just being difficult 0r d0 y0u really n0t remember
well 0bvi0usly!
but i really appreciate y0ur help anyway
well y0u said that y0ud need an0ther set 0f glyphs t0 make sense 0f them
y0u speculated that there might be an0ther set 0f ruins
y0u even guessed they w0uld be blue! it turns 0ut y0u were right
d0nt y0u think that is pretty c00l?
but y0u say that ab0ut everything!
n0 its n0t!
i did find s0me 0ther neat things d0wn here t00 which are strange but quite harmless and n0t f0reb0ding in the least!
like this AMAZING hat!
it is an authentic arche0l0gists hat its s0 hard t0 find them in this style
there are n0 h0rn h0les but i l0ve it anyway its great
i wasnt g0ing t0 tell y0u ab0ut that!
damn it h0w did y0u kn0w
this is stupid
maybe
well
0k
ahem
sorry to interrupt i wanted to give you both the chance to remember but it doesnt look like this is going anywhere!
w0w what
is it coming back yet
this is a mem0ry
in a dream bubble
thats right!
y0u changed y0ur v0ice because y0u remembered
like i did
that i died
this is my mem0ry and als0 hers
but i went 0n t0 bec0me the r0b0t wh0se remains are in this crater
whereas she did n0t
i d0nt actually kn0w her st0ry 0r h0w she g0t here but f0r me this was the end 0f the r0ad
this is the afterlife
nope!
you are just asleep
you are also blind!
yes thats what being blind means
sollux will you shut up and stop being so tragic for once
you knew this was going to happen! your prophecies of personal doom were practically all you ever talked about
i think you were looking forward to this honestly
shes right
great!
you should be able to relax now that youve been released from the curse of your vision twofold just like you said youd be
you are now merely doomed!
being d00med isnt that bad
i spent m0st 0f my life that way remember
at least y0u have the luxury 0f understanding
and the best part ab0ut being d00med is y0u 0nly have t0 put up with it until y0u die
thats the spirit hahaha
actually i guess i dont have to keep talking like im doomed anymore do i
nope :)
hahahahaha!
hahahahaha!
i
dont know?
really?
what noise?
oh its jade!
whos jade
shes one of the humans we met after you died
ok
i guess i am out of the loop on chronology for once
thats fine youll catch up!
no dont!
sollux try to be polite
there is no reason at all for you to feel hostile toward them anymore
jade is very nice and she did nothing wrong
none of them did so when you wake up maybe you should try to reconcile with them or at the very least just say hello
did i what
well no
but i should have!
i did with you before i left didnt i
this is awkward
shush you!
what actually happened after i died it sounds complicated
it is!
ill get you up to speed i promise but guys come on lets not scare away our guest
ok then ill shut up
i think one aradia saying things is more than enough probably
oh my god shut up!
no jade its ok
please stay! im curious about why you are here
navigating between bubbles is difficult here
its better to drift between them naturally as they intersect
not spatially but through common points in memory
to navigate the furthest ring you need to have mastered the flow of time!
that is why i am here
i am alive again so i may assist the dead in this way
jade tell me
have you seen me here before? i mean me dressed like i am now wearing my godhood
im wearing a hood and have butterfly wings what else would you like to know
yes sollux that would probably be pretty weird
thank you your outfit is quite spiffy too
i like that skirt a lot especially
is
is that a skirt?
shhh!
yes ok
you see those encounters you had with me before have not happened for me yet because ive only just arrived
time follows strange paths here as does space
if you travel a great enough distance you may discover you are also traveling either backwards or forwards in time as well!
just as if you stay in one place for too long the geometry of space surrounding you will become unreliable
you may swat the air to your left and discover you have just slapped yourself!
the only way to make sense of it is to understand either property very well
and since i am new here i have some learning to do just like everyone else
but i do know one thing
i knew that the first bubble i would enter would be an important one for us to visit
hang on
we are moving on to a new memory hold that thought
it is important because it will help us begin to understand why we are all here
no no
not why we are in this bubble now
but why we all exist in the first place and why we all went on this adventure together
there is much to understand and i believe it all begins with one sequence of events
watching will help those whove passed to understand the purpose of their sacrifice and those still living to understand what must be done to complete the journey still ahead
we will let the memories lead the way
are you guys ready?
ok lets allow the next memory to take shape
i believe it is kanayas
i will reprise my role in a conversation i had with her shortly after i discovered the ruins
everybody hide and try not to spoil it for her until she remembers!
hey kanaya
there is s0mething i want t0 give y0u
yes its s0mething very 0dd i f0und when i disc0vered the ruins the 0ther night
i d0nt kn0w what its arche0l0gical significance is yet but i suspect y0u will be able t0 repair it!
0_0
w0w!
uh i mean
o_o
wow
you figured that out very fast!
oh i am sure you are alive
you are unconscious now and will likely wake up as your new self very soon
yes
you are undergoing a metamorphosis which you have been groomed for since you were very young
much like i was for my various personal iterations including this one
yes!
but it sure sounds silly when you list them all like that
wellllll
that is what we are about to find out!
if you will oblige us by continuing with this memory
why dont we go through this conversation again to the best of our recollection
but i guess rather than acting it out we can just talk about it
the old fashioned way
i have no idea
haha yeah you know what i mean though
yes
i then had sollux deliver the pieces to you so you could stitch it back up
sollux that is your cue!
come out and play the part
no of course not!
obviously the jig is up everyone can come out now
no guys come on this isnt that complicated!
we are just revisiting the past just like we would if we were talking about it
but it just so happens we can watch it happen as we talk about it
and as a matter of fact
this story does involve a role playing game but not in that way!
youre stupid and you sound stupid!
i dont know o_o
but you maaay be waking up soon
maybe not if we hurry this along!
thollux is right
i mean sollux
kanaya tell us what happened next!
yes
not really!
yes
bye sollux
this is only a piece of the story
the other pieces will fall into place with successive memories and it will all become clear
but yes alright i will eliminate some suspense and try to serve as a better guide on this tour through the catacombs of our collective subconscious
the separate tunnels we once traveled in the dark as individuals we now retrace together with a torch
on the walls we illuminate the runes which describe a convoluted origin story
an origin we participated in
we were spurred to these actions by that which was being originated
and incited to acts of revenge as we were turned against each other
no
our manipulator disguised his tracks well
no tavros you can get up
we will leave it soon
but you were doing something very important here
writing a part of the code
an incomplete fragment consisting of four symbols
comprising the first word of a binary refrain
a pair of sounds emerging from the belly of a fabled tyrants menace
but you authored only one sound of the pair
i would write the other
in the soot of my ruined hive i scrawled my part of the code
completing the phrase of legend
the persisting sounds said to accompany the ultimate demise of the tyrant less an arm and an eye
but even these eight characters
the scrawlings of charge
were still but half the code
there was another half by scourge in two parts
one part three symbols
and the other
five
why the scale was tipped in this way between sisters
i cannot say!
each fragment would be transcribed in our rulebooks
sealing the collaboration between rust bloods and blue bloods
completing the code for our sessions architect
not exactly
there was another fragment
oh?
yes
an additional eight symbols
from a wild card source i suppose
it came from a timeline not meant to happen
the one i came from to ensure it wouldnt
thus sealing my fate
i believed the fragment was gibberish from a lunatic
after completing his rampage through our session
since it was not part of the scripted chronology i was oblivious until it was too late to stop it
not that it would matter if i did the timeline had already gone astray
i pieced together what had happened by sleuthing the various scenes
and discovered the text which the code was recorded in
i decided to return to the alpha timeline with the text
as evidence for his madness i guess
in the alpha timeline this text was destroyed
in an explosion caused by a computer virus
this explosion did not take place on my timeline
i identified this event as the difference prompting the offshoot
and returned to our planet via the reckoning just as i did at the end of my life
though that time deliberately
to influence events quietly to make sure it happened
and later joined the rest of our doomed selves to help defeat the king
the others surely had similar responsibilities along the way
as for the book
i lost track of it shortly after i arrived
yes we all lost track of our books
they were gathered surreptitiously by agents assigned to the task
and in the veil their codes were merged with the ghost imprints of other mysterious artifacts
our first guardian was brought to life on the seed to pass through skaias final gate of defense
the first to find alternia
hey what are you doing out here!
out of your bubble
i just didnt think you could
i guess you must have a foot on either side
cant say im surprised!
i am waiting for friends to arrive
they will need my help
no theyre alive
first
there will be two humans
they should be joining us any minute
then rest of our party
the survivors
yes
well
they made it
your body will arrive with them
along with the others
hey maybe we can have a funeral!
kind of like
a big corpse party
the humans could probably explain it better than me
you can see the sun?
