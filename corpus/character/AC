:33 < *ac saunters from her dark cave a little bit sl33py from the recent kill*
:33 < *ac uses one of her mouths to lick the fresh blood off her paws*
:33 < *and the other one to blow you a kiss!*
:33 < *yes! ac finds that to be a most admirable use of a kiss!*
:33 < *she thinks that goblin wishes n33d to come true too just like any other kind of purrsons wishes*
:33 < *ac begs your pardon while she rips apart this tasty beast to prepare a meal for her cubs*
:33 < uh oh!
:33 < dont you dare!
:33 < i mean
:33 < *ac shouts dont you dare!*
:33 < *indignantly*
:33 < *ac says noooooooo and looks a bit crestfallen*
:33 < *ac gets a clever idea to slake the majestic dragons mighty hunger*
:33 < *she prepares the lions share of the slain armored cholerbear for gc*
:33 < *ac pawses a moment and nods knowingly with a couple of smug grins on her face*
:33 < *she confirms it is ind33d the bulliest of bears!*
:33 < *but as it happens the really cute cub lands in a bush safe and sound, whew!*
:33 < *ac crinkles up her nose and prepares for a really unprecedented marathon of baffling feline obstinacy*
:33 < *her dragonyyydy suitor will make neither rhyme nor reason of her purrplexing behavior for even an instant!*
:33 < oh! h33h33
:33 < ok if you mean a computer game then yes that sounds like fun
:33 < team?
:33 < who else is playing?
:33 < oh
:33 < well it does sound like it will be a lot of fun but i think i should get purrmission first
:33 < i know!
:33 < but still im kind of scared of him and i think purrhaps its best to just run it by him first so there isnt a kerfuffle about it or anything
:33 < i knooow
:33 < but i dont think itll be a big deal
:33 < ill just mention it casually and itll be fine im sure and then we can play in just a little bit!
:33 < k!
:33 < *ac perks up curiously*
:33 < *she wiggles her rear end a bit and then chases something she s33s bounce into one of karkats shoes*
:33 < i am???
:33 < i mean *ac says i am??? wondrously*
:33 < *ac gathers up all the brick pieces and builds a cute little house and invites karkat inside*
:33 < yesss that sounds fun
:33 < ok what do i do?
:33 < alright! i will talk to him about that
:33 < oh
:33 < *ac pawses and looks up with a little bit of chagrin*
:33 < i forgot i have to talk to someone else about this
:33 < i have b33n purrcrastinating :((
:33 < its not that big of a deal!
:33 < hes not so bad!
:33 < *ac twitches her friendly whiskers at ct*
:33 < *ct purrplexes over where he put that important wrench that he n33ded for building a fancy robot or something*
:33 < *he says, now where did that silly old wrench go??*
:33 < *but oh look! ct p33ks around the corner to find that a very playful kitty has stolen the robot wrench and is now kicking it vigorously with her hind legs!*
