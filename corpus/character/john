1926
i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.
1926
ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?
1926
all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?
1926
try using your brain numbnuts.
1926
it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.
1926
no.
1926
did you?
1926
game bro is a joke and we both know it.
1926
alright.
1935
yes, it is understandable because you are really attractive. i am attracted to you.
1935
jk haha.
1935
no, i don't have it yet.
1935
my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.
1935
and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.
1935
it's so frustrating.
1935
what?
1935
oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out.
1935
what is yours?
1935
what the hell is that?
1935
i guess.
1935
no.
1935
well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms.
1935
how?
1939
ok, i did it.
1939
yeah.
1939
uh...
1939
yeah, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant.
1963
that's an ugly rumor.
1963
whoever told you that is a filthy liar.
1963
and you should probably stop hitting on him all the time or whatever.
1963
anyway i still haven't checked the mail, my dad has it.
1963
i'm trying to go get it from him, so brb
1963
what?
1963
no, why would you even think that??
1963
that's so stupid.
1963
alright, wish me luck.
1963
oh, btw...
1963
jk I was wearing a funny disguise this whole time.
1963
gotcha! hehehehe
2010
i discovered a comet that is going to destroy the earth, and it was named after me.
2010
now i am famous, and everyone wants to talk to me a lot.
2010
mcconaughey.
2010
those are my dad's.
2010
oh, what?! no man, cage is sweet. so sweet.
2010
i do things ironically sometimes.
2010
what about what i sent you for your birthday?
2010
what? no, they're stupid, which was the joke. the IRONIC joke. get it?
2010
wait...
2010
you're actually wearing them, aren't you?
2010
you do realize they touched stiller's weird, sort of gaunt face at some point.
2010
yeah.
2010
yeah, there's a big red one.
2010
i would, but it's trapped under the sburb beta, so i will probably open it after i install the beta.
2010
yeah! wanna play it?
2010
why not!
2010
where'd she go.
2010
ok, i will.
2035
whoa ok but i just got the most awesome present.
2035
SO SWEET.
2035
ha ha, what?
2035
oh the game, ok.
2035
i don't really know how this works. what am i even looking at here?
2035
oh, ok then.
2041
whoa, what are you doing??
2041
is my magic chest on the roof now??
2041
:(
2044
hey, do you think you could do me a favor?
2044
can you grab all that stuff outside my broken window and bring it in for me?
2044
thx!
2044
:C
2053
wow, ok.
2053
what do they do?
2053
how do i move stuff around? it sounds fun!
2053
what??
2053
no!
2053
oh man.
2053
i think i might know where it is.
2054
good idea!
2054
ugh, i was fussing with my retarded sylladex.
2054
but i think i have it under control now.
2054
what modus do you use?
2054
oh no, that sounds so awkward.
2057
why is the floor shaking?
2057
are you dropping more stuff in my house?
2057
sweet!
2057
what is with all these big contraptions?
2057
huh.
2057
to what end?
2057
i mean what are we supposed to be doing in this game?
2060
hey, i'm out on the balcony now.
2060
i am messaging from my dad's pda.
2060
no, i am telling you.
2060
it jumped out of my sylladex like a frightened weasel.
2060
what? no.
2060
those were all accidents.
2060
please take your psycho-babblery elsewhere, miss!
2060
oh man, see this isn't cool.
2060
all this snooping nonsense!
2060
yes. there is.
2060
ok, if that will satisfy your weird ocd complex then go ahead.
2060
in your case, probably!
2060
anyway...
2060
i am going to have a look at this enormous platformy thing you put on the balcony.
2063
whoops what?
2064
what was that noise?
2064
is this something i should go investigate?
2065
augh!
2065
the what?
2069
oh hey!
2069
no, not yet.
2069
oh!
2069
yes, but it is in my dad's car and he is still out at the store.
2069
he should be back soon.
2069
i am up to my neck in this sburb stuff.
2069
TT is making a royal mess of my house.
2069
oh, it is this game.
2069
it's ok i guess. i'm still figuring it out.
2069
what was what?
2069
wow, really?
2069
oh man, alright but be careful, ok?
2070
oh hell no, you put this thing in front of the door?
2070
um, YEAH???
2070
you mean you thought it was elegant?
2070
ok well what do i do with this thing.
2070
hello?
2070
what are you doing up there now?
2074
you can see me, right.
2074
tell me what is wrong with this picture.
2074
haha, yeah I hear you.
2074
i know!
2074
what about going outside?
2074
maybe you could catch a neighbor's signal.
2074
It's dark already?
2074
haha, um, ok.
2078
what is this thing?
2078
and what is that clock counting down to?
2078
ok.
2078
weird.
2078
well, i mean it is a new game.
2084
this thing keeps following me around.
2084
i think it's trying to talk to me or something.
2084
hmm, ok.
2084
well, you are the one with the cursor so just do whatever you think is the right thing to do!
2084
also, fix my bathroom.
2087
i still can't understand this thing's gobbledygook.
2087
the clock is ticking.
2087
we don't have time for this asinine tomfoolery.
2087
extravagant hogwash!
2087
ok stop
2087
stop typing whatever silly thing you're typing.
2087
i'm going upstairs to the big platformy thing.
2087
??
2104
oh man who cares about the bathroom, now there's a meteor heading for my house!!!
2104
i don't know, maybe! what do i do!
2104
wow, FASCINATING.
2104
??????
2104
ok i'll do that.
2104
oh man, the bunny was awesome, but i don't have time to talk, i'm playing sburb and it's kind of a nightmare.
2104
TT is breaking everything in my house.
2104
and now there's a meteor coming, and i'm not even joking about that!!!
2104
it's like a big asteroid or comet or something.
2104
in the sky.
2104
heading right for my house!!!!!!!!
2104
i dunno.
2104
big, i guess.
2104
i gotta go!
2104
we'll talk later if i am still alive and the earth isn't blown up.
2111
alright, i used the lathe to make this blue shapey thing.
2111
now i guess i take it back to the alchemixer again?
2111
hello???????
2111
uh...
2140
hurry up and open my door!!!!!!
2140
not that it even matters, i think i'm probably dead no matter what!!!!!!
2140
???
2140
so what is it, like an apple or something?
2140
what good will that even do?
2140
do we have enough of those building jewels to make it?
2156
hey, yeah i'm here!
2156
and not dead i think.
2156
oh man, sorry, i was looking around for my dad and i can't find him anywhere!
2156
have you seen him?
2156
yeah, like where am i??
2156
wow, ok.
2156
so then i guess if this is all the game's doing, then the point is for us to save the world?
2156
then we'd better get moving and figure this game out!!!
2156
ok.
2156
wait, rose! one thing...
2156
you never even wished me a happy birthday!
2156
um... hello?
2156
haha, oh jeez, that is silly!
2156
anyway, thanks!
2168
i'm fine i guess.
2168
since i got here i feel compelled to do these weird things i don't really want to do.
2168
by some kind of voice that i can't really even hear. i don't know, it is hard to explain.
2168
yeah, maybe. who knows!
2168
Ok. I will go back inside.
2175
what? oh man, you're going to use that?
2175
that sucks, what a stupid idea!
2175
but the cake mix... ugh, that's so dumb.
2175
fine.
2175
i GUESS.
2178
OH YES, SWEET!!
2178
now we're talking!
2183
aw man, where'd it go?
2183
what, there's a fire??
2183
oh jeez!
2183
so move this thing already!
2183
how much do you have?
2183
oh.
2183
hmm.
2183
i thought about jumping to the car from the ledge earlier but that sounds really dangerous!
2187
dude, i don't have time for your nerdy raps!
2187
it sounds like you don't even believe me that i was about to get blown up!
2187
but i really was, but now im in some weird dimension that sburb sent me to or something.
2187
and now on top of that i think i'm being haunted by my dead grandma!
2187
yeah, it's true but i'll talk to you later about it!
2187
man, see i just don't think all the rapping stuff is really as cool as you think it is.
2187
no, i have to go! bye!
2189
whoa, ok.
2189
but the door is locked!
2189
but it's my dad's car :(
2189
alright.
2193
oh hi!
2193
was it by any chance a meteor?
2193
oh man, it's kind of a long story!
2193
anyway, are you ok? did it blow up your yard or start a fire or anything?
2193
well gosh, he's probably right!
2193
er...
2193
yeah, i was trying to get it, but rose dropped my car into a weird spooky bottomless pit and the package was in the car and im really sorry about that.
2193
wow, ok, i guess i should start at the beginning.
2193
see, a meteor blew up my neighborhood.
2193
but i'm ok! and my house is too, sort of.
2193
that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose, sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.
2193
but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the world from the apocalypse!!!
2193
wow, you think so?
2193
well ok, BUT.
2193
it's not even that simple!
2193
i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from meteors and fire and stuff.
2193
but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!
2193
so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!
2193
but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff.
2193
yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.
2194
aaaaaarrrgh!
2194
stop rapping for a second you horse's ass!
2194
i have something important to talk about.
2194
rose is in trouble and she needs help. i was going to connect to her with sburb but i lost my copy!
2194
also she lost battery power. if she can get back up and running, she'll need someone with the game to get her out of there before her house burns down.
2194
so i think you should use your copy of the game to help her!
2194
why?
2194
i thought you said you had two?
2194
ok, well get his then!
2194
whatever.
2194
also you might want to read rose's walkthrough to get up to speed on this.
2194
what?
2194
/ROLLS EYES
2224
i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.
2224
ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?
2224
all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?
2224
try using your brain numbnuts.
2224
it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.
2224
no.
2224
did you?
2224
game bro is a joke and we both know it.
2224
alright.
2286
oh, good!
2286
yeah, there is no sign of rose yet, i hope she is ok
2286
you mean that cheap piece of shit you have on your wall?
2286
ok i don't really care.
2286
i'm in my room again, i really think there's someone else in this house.
2286
like monsters or something.
2286
haha I WISH.
2286
maybe. yeah you're right.
2286
ok ok stop!
2286
what do i do?
2286
hmm...
2286
ok, i guess i can read up on data structures some more.
2286
how's it going there?
2286
hahaha.
2286
oh god.
2286
SO LAME.
2286
see...
2286
i just don't know why you think it's cool.
2286
his ventriloquist rapping thing.
2286
that's fine, you are entitled to your opinion, i am just saying that being a white guy who is a rapper with a ventriloquist doll is not cool by any stretch of the imagination or by any definition of word cool, ironic or otherwise. that's all i'm saying.
2286
yeah, more like the opposite of all those things is the thing that is true!
2286
i'm going to read.
2286
good luck with your bro.
2320
um... nanna?
2320
wow, you scared the living daylights out of me!
2320
well, i guess it was a really great prank. good one nanna.
2320
anyway, are you REALLY my dead nanna?
2320
ok, i guess i will take your word for it. i don't remember you at all! my dad said i was really young when you died.
2320
hey speaking of which, do you know where he is??? i looked everywhere for him!
2321
oh no!
2321
what? ok, so what is the medium you are talking about?
2321
you mean because we are inside a computer, or in the game software or something?
2321
well, uh, it's like this machine that, uh...
2321
oh, ok.
2321
i'm not sure i get it, but alright.
2321
so what do i actually need to be doing here?
2324
ME??
2325
wow, really? then what's the point?
2325
whoa!!!
2325
how am i supposed to get up there?
2326
ok, i think i get it now!
2326
so i guess the battle against good and evil is sort of irrelevant? well, i don't know, that all sounds kind of weird, but in any case, we build the house to get to these gates, and then i can save my dad!
2326
and then after that, we solve this ultimate riddle thing and save earth from destruction!!!
2327
oh...
2327
and that is?
2328
thanks, nanna.
2328
hooray!
2328
...
2373
so i can see.
2373
stupid lousy imps.
2373
they're mucking up all my cool stuff!
2373
oh, yeah.
2373
sorry!
2373
i'm not sure what came over me there, i was acting really crazy for some reason.
2373
but my head feels like it's clearing up, i think i'm alright now.
2378
rose my piano!!!
2378
:C
2378
i guess you're right.
2378
so...
2378
that means i have to go out the back door?
2378
well it may sound dumb, but i was hoping to avoid nanna and her spooky ghost cookies.
2378
can you see her in the kitchen?
2378
what's she doing, is she baking?
2378
are you SURE you can't get that grist up to me somehow?
2382
on what?
2384
oh yeah. ok.
2384
blargh!
2384
well, what are you building?
2384
oh man...
2384
i could have warned you about stairs, rose!
2385
IT KEEPS HAPENING
2385
i told you rose
2385
i TOLD you about stairs!
2385
did you know he thinks puppets are cool?
2385
he's so dumb!!
2438
wow, that was so totally unnecessary!
2438
you mean these stairs?
2438
man, look at these shitty stairs...
2438
they're so narrow! i'm supposed to climb those?
2439
so why didn't you just build a way up through that hole into my dad's room?
2439
no.
2439
huh?
2439
oh come on. what's the big deal, i'll just climb up and go right through!
2439
yeah, why not?
2439
well, i mean yeah...
2439
wait, are you saying there's something, like...
2439
troubling in there?
2439
what do you mean? what do you see in there?
2439
oh.
2439
pfff...
2439
whatever!
2439
i think i can handle a few more stupid clown paintings.
2451
oh yeah, you're right.
2451
dammit!
2522
whoa, did you just make all these??
2522
sweet, thanks!
2522
what did you do with all the blue wobbly vase-looking things?
2522
ok.
2536
i combined the cards in the lathe thingy and made this!
2536
it is so sweet, man look at me go.
2536
thanks!
2536
i got the idea from harry anderson.
2536
uh, you know the show night court?
2536
oh.
2536
well bottom line is...
2536
he's awesome
2536
that's really all there is to say on the matter!
2543
hey, that was a pretty, uh...
2543
nice...
2543
uh...
2543
... save.
2543
oh, yeah.
2543
that.
2543
this is pretty comfy.
2543
why don't you just like,
2543
carry the bed around with me on it?
2543
up to the gate up there!
2543
oh.
2543
lame!
2543
well, ok.
2543
all that scurrying around kind of wore me out, i think i'm going to rest here for a bit.
2543
rose, can you keep the imps at bay? like, drop some stuff on them if they sneak too close.
2543
what, come on!
2543
oh alright.
2543
i'm just gonna rest my eyes here a second though.
2552
whoa, there you are!
2552
it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now.
2552
oh but, like...
2552
i don't think i am actually saving the world here. :(
2552
i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that.
2552
yeah, you're probably right.
2552
but, um...
2552
i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?
2552
hmm, i dunno, maybe you talked to rose or dave about it or something.
2552
they're really weird when they talk to me about you, like they're always trying convince me you have some spooky powers, but i'm always like no she seems like a pretty regular girl to me!
2552
but then when i think back maybe there are times when it seems like you know some things?
2552
like maybe you know more about a thing than you are telling me? i dunno.
2552
waiting for what!
2552
oh yeah.
2552
what ever happened with that?
2552
yeah i know, tell me about it!
2552
maybe you should like, wear an alarm clock or something.
2552
so what was the deal with the meteor?
2552
so what is it???
2552
or is this just another thing you're "waiting" to tell me???
2552
huh?
2552
AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2552
stop being so confusing!!!!
2555
rose, why aren't you dropping something on that thing??
2555
oh no
2555
D:
2780
oh, hey!
2780
you're back.
2780
oh, so you mean dave connected with you?
2780
um, ok.
2780
i don't really think i get it.
2780
is this relevant?
2780
ok, later!
2785
ok nanna, i will.
2785
hey, nanna?
2785
since i am trying to get up to that gate, and since you can sort of conjure floating beds and throw me around and all...
2785
couldn't you just throw me up to the gate?
2785
oh, ok, i guess that's what i figured.
2785
so just one more thing...
2785
do you think that instead of telling me exactly why that is with a clear explanation, you can give me a series of really coy riddles about it and then sort of giggle?
2785
ha ha, i guess.
2785
i suddenly understand everything!
2900
hey, happy birthday jade!
2900
whew ok, i got your present in the mail JUST on time.
2900
plus i sent rose's and dave's too.
2900
why do your guys'es birthdays got to be all bunched together like that??? you are running me ragged!
2900
i can't wait for you to see what i got you. i don't want to spoil it or anything but hopefully it will help you solve those problems you've been having lately.
2900
MYSTERIOUS WINK ;)
2900
oh man.
2900
i am such an idiot, i forgot about how long it takes you to get stuff.
2900
ARGH.
2900
ok well i hope so.
2900
oh god.
2900
the trolls again?
2900
they have been such a pain in the ass lately.
2900
it seems like there are so many.
2900
there are either like fifty of these retards or it's one guy with a lot of alt accounts.
2900
what do they want with us!!!
2900
oh hell no, shittiest pranksters ever.
2900
oh wow, what? years??
2900
ok, well i am sick of them.
2900
i've been thinking of changing my pesterchum handle to throw them off the trail.
2900
so...
2900
i guess i'm gonna do that.
2903
oh whoa hi!
2903
oh...
2903
gonna make some stuff.
2903
are you ok? hasn't your house been on fire for like...
2903
five hours now?
2903
wow, congrats i guess?
2903
nah.
2903
his bro is probably busy kicking his ass.
2903
that's probably all there is to say on the matter.
2903
yeah, ok i hear you, but...
2903
i think we'll have plenty. i've been killing imps all over the house and now its lousy with gushers.
2903
i mean grist.
2903
serves them right for ruining my posters. the bastards.
2903
don't you see? my sweet movie posters. look at them, they're fucking ruined.
2903
??????
2903
uh, YEAH?
2903
VERY FUNNY ROSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2904
NICE JOKE
2904
GREAT JOKE THERE ROSE
2904
TOP OF THE LINE PRANK
2904
HE HE
2904
HA HA HA HA HA
2904
yes
2904
YES
2904
LET'S KEEP THIS JOKE GOING
2904
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A GOOD ONE
2904
HA HA HA HA
2904
OH MY
2904
HA HA HA HA HA HA
2904
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
2922
ok, while i make some stuff here can you keep an eye out for imps?
2922
just keep the safe or tub handy or something.
2922
it'll serve them right for trashing my posters.
2922
AND I KEEP TELLING YOU HA HA VERY FUNNY
2922
yeah, i saw those, but...
2922
they didn't look like that before. you must have changed them.
2922
then why didn't you TELL me they were there???
2922
ok, it still doesn't make sense though.
2922
implying that i drew them a while ago and then forgot and couldn't see them and now suddenly see them.
2922
that's stupid, what would that even mean.
2923
yeah.
2923
oh no, i just realized!
2923
you are going to psycho-therapify me.
2923
well don't bother!
2923
maybe...
2923
/EYES SUSPSICIOSLY
2923
anyway i guess you saw what's in there, it's boring and there's not much to even see.
2923
well...
2923
i don't know, at first i was nervous to go in and find more of his weird clowns, because of course they are stupid and i hate them a lot.
2923
but then when i didn't see any, it was weird.
2923
i felt weirdly, like... disappointed almost.
2923
yeah, i guess.
2923
uh no, maybe not.
2923
but what are you getting at?
2923
it sounds like you're saying i'm crazy!
2924
oh god.
2924
see?? this is therapy bullshit!
2924
why now?
2924
but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.
2924
he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE.
2924
i dunno.
2924
not sure about all this.
2924
but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.
2924
yeah.
2925
wow, what are you doing by the way?
2925
rose, sorry to say but this is all looking kind of silly!
2925
yeah no shit!
2925
ok, but you really must be running low on time by now, right?
2925
STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!
2973
oh hey!
2973
no, not yet.
2973
oh!
2973
yes, but it is in my dad's car and he is still out at the store.
2973
he should be back soon.
2973
i am up to my neck in this sburb stuff.
2973
TT is making a royal mess of my house.
2973
oh, it is this game.
2973
it's ok i guess. i'm still figuring it out.
2973
what was what?
2973
wow, really?
2973
oh man, alright but be careful, ok?
2973
oh hi!
2973
was it by any chance a meteor?
2973
oh man, it's kind of a long story!
2973
anyway, are you ok? did it blow up your yard or start a fire or anything?
2973
well gosh, he's probably right!
2973
er...
2973
yeah, i was trying to get it, but rose dropped my car into a weird spooky bottomless pit and the package was in the car and im really sorry about that.
2973
wow, ok, i guess i should start at the beginning.
2973
see, a meteor blew up my neighborhood.
2973
but i'm ok! and my house is too, sort of.
2973
that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose, sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.
2973
but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the world from the apocalypse!!!
2973
wow, you think so?
2973
well ok, BUT.
2973
it's not even that simple!
2973
i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from meteors and fire and stuff.
2973
but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!
2973
so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!
2973
but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff.
2973
yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.
2974
whoa, there you are!
2974
it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now.
2974
oh but, like...
2974
i don't think i am actually saving the world here. :(
2974
i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that.
2974
yeah, you're probably right.
2974
but, um...
2974
i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?
2974
hmm, i dunno, maybe you talked rose or dave about it or something.
2974
they're really weird when they talk to me about you, like they're always trying convince me you have some spooky powers, but i'm always like no she seems like a pretty regular girl to me!
2974
but then when i think back maybe there are times when it seems like you know some things?
2974
like maybe you know more about a thing than you are telling me? i dunno.
2974
waiting for what!
2974
oh yeah.
2974
what ever happened with that?
2974
yeah i know, tell me about it!
2974
maybe you should like, wear an alarm clock or something.
2974
so what was the deal with the meteor?
2974
so what is it???
2974
or is this just another thing you're "waiting" to tell me???
2974
huh?
2974
AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2974
stop being so confusing!!!!
3291
rose?
3291
are you there?
3291
i went through the gate, nanna said you might be here too.
3291
are you in kind of this spooky glowy place with oily rivers and stuff?
3291
let me know ok.
3291
hi jade!
3291
guess where i am.
3291
yeah!
3291
wait how did you know that's where the gate goes...
3291
did you talk to rose? can she still see me while im down here?
3291
she won't answer.
3291
oh man.
3291
he sounds like such a handful.
3291
but it's ok, i think he is mostly just looking after you.
3291
like a guardian angel or something.
3291
if i were you i would take him out behind the woodshed and give him a big hug.
3291
oh? what game?
3291
what, i thought you didn't even know what sburb was!
3291
oh ok.
3291
where did you even get it?
3291
wow.
3291
the thing you just said doesn't even make the slightest bit of sense.
3291
oh really?
3291
this is news to me.
3291
oh yeah, i think so. it'll be kind of a long walk though, this place is huge.
3291
okay.
3291
wait, how did you know my dad's car fell down here?
3291
jeeeeeeeeeeez!
3291
ok fine well color me suspicious anyway.
3291
miss knowitall mcpsychicpants.
3291
ok sure i am convinced.
3291
you have convinced me.
3291
(PSYCHIC PSYCHIC PSYCHIC)
3291
also i told you the package was in the car but i never mentioned that the game was there too.
3291
so kind of totally busted i guess.
3291
GIVE ME A P
3291
GIVE ME AN S
3291
ok, that is fair.
3294
aaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
3294
how did you find me?????
3294
i changed my chum handle to ditch you guys.
3294
how did you find me?
3294
uh...
3294
lame.
3294
what, the last few months?
3294
ok, this time i'll believe you that you aren't human.
3294
because the skepticism center of my brain is starting to wear kind of thin i guess.
3294
but you're still a major asshole and i don't actually want to talk to you, so bye.
3294
hahahahahaha!
3294
oh man, look at this outburst of little human words i'm saying!
3294
from my human mouth!
3294
that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard.
3294
wait...
3294
you have something to do with this game, don't you?
3294
i should have known.
3294
friendship isn't an emotion fucknuts.
3294
why are you kissing my ass?
3294
what do you want? why don't you just tell me what's going on.
3294
are you in the medium?
3294
like, here in this land, with the clouds and oil and stuff?
3294
so why don't you just explain it again so i know...
3294
so i don't ask so much in the future???
3294
wow, yeah you're totally not trolling me, bro!
3294
i see now we are bffs forever.
3294
oh, ok.
3294
so what do you want.
3294
yeah, i don't blame her for not answering.
3294
she pretty much can't stand you guys.
3294
because of all the trolling you did before.
3294
remember?
3294
maybe.
3294
we'll see.
3294
i'm still not really sold on this friendship thing yet.
3294
but i've got to go now and get on with my petty little quests.
3294
so talk to you in the future i guess.
3294
jerkface.
3329
nanna, are you there?
3329
i just saw my house from below. what gives? why did the gate take me down here?
3329
huh. alright. so i guess i scramble around down here until... uh, until what?
3329
ok, so i get to that gate and go in. then what? where does it take me? uh... further up maybe? but i haven't even built that high yet.
3329
yeah, well, i do nanna but i'm still not really getting it. does the next gate down here take me back up to the house or something?
3329
(please don't say hoo hoo hoo)
3423
rose?
3423
are you there?
3423
i went through the gate, nanna said you might be here too.
3423
are you in kind of this spooky glowy place with oily rivers and stuff?
3423
let me know ok.
3423
bluh bluh bluuuuuhhhhh.
3423
ok, what words would you use, miss wordypants mcsmartybluh.
3423
umm...
3423
i haven't found an ocean yet.
3423
but i dunno, the place is really big.
3423
it's like a whole planet down here.
3423
oh man, which reminds me.
3423
i just got hounded by a troll.
3423
yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but like not the same session as ours or something.
3423
oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but whatever.
3423
yeah, i guess answer him if you want. or not.
3423
but anyway, it's great you made it here alive and stuff!
3423
so dave came through?
3423
for what?
3423
oh, haha.
3423
yeah, i'd feel kinda weird if dave was watching me too.
3423
rose i feel weird when you're just TALKING to me, when you're watching me it's just like the weird frosting on the big weirdo cake.
3423
yes i'm freeeeeeeeee :D
3423
ok, i'm going to go over this river and through these woods.
3423
you talk to your troll i guess.
3423
we'll compare notes later.
3425
hey, happy birthday jade!
3425
whew ok, i got your present in the mail JUST on time.
3425
plus i sent rose's and dave's too.
3425
why do your guys'es birthdays got to be all bunched together like that??? you are running me ragged!
3425
i can't wait for you to see what i got you. i don't want to spoil it or anything but hopefully it will help you solve those problems you've been having lately.
3425
MYSTERIOUS WINK ;)
3425
oh man.
3425
i am such an idiot, i forgot about how long it takes you to get stuff.
3425
ARGH.
3425
ok well i hope so.
3425
oh god.
3425
the trolls again?
3425
they have been such a pain in the ass lately.
3425
it seems like there are so many.
3425
there are either like fifty of these retards or it's one guy with a lot of alt accounts.
3425
what do they want with us!!!
3425
oh hell no, shittiest pranksters ever.
3425
oh wow, what? years??
3425
ok, well i am sick of them.
3425
i've been thinking of changing my pesterchum handle to throw them off.
3425
so...
3425
i guess i'm gonna do that.
3428
uuuuugh
3428
?
3428
well
3428
i guess you're not too bad a troll if this is all you do.
3428
just laughing and stuff.
3428
hehe
3428
hehehehehehe
3428
uh...
3479
who?
3479
oh, that's right...
3479
the leetspeaking blind one.
3479
go away!
3479
which one, the blindness or the leetspeak.
3479
sorry.
3479
wow, you drive a hard bargain!
3479
but nooooooooooooo.
3479
yeah, well you're a huge...
3479
oh man, whatever, what do you even want.
3479
do you have a braille screen or something?
3479
i don't really understand.
3479
so you can "see" my whole future there, right?
3479
by just like, scrolling around on some computer thing that lets you pick what time to talk to me?
3479
how can you be bored by my long boring future, why don't you just scroll around to wherever you want like the other weirdos are doing?
3479
oh ok, that sounds really great and helpful!
3479
sounds dumb.
3479
but if it means you're going to help me, then go ahead and help me i guess.
3479
whoa, you've got a map?
3479
where'd you get it?
3479
can i have it?
3479
ok.
3480
this is the worst crap i have ever seen.
3480
what am i looking at here?
3480
ok sorry but it's useless.
3480
what's with these colors.
3480
couldn't you just, like...
3480
crop the world map.
3480
i thought you guys were THE BEST.
3480
you mean The Breeze?
3480
sure.
3503
what?
3503
i am just acting out a scene from an awesome movie and having some fun, what's wrong with that?
3503
no, it's about these criminals on a runaway plane, and they've got to be stopped by nick cage and john cusack together as a team.
3503
it is sweet, so sweet, you would probably like it.
3503
hahaha, oh man, that sucked so bad!
3503
don't you have alien movies from your alien planet?
3503
ok, so what is a really good one?
3503
well, i already laughed when you said the name of one of ours, so who cares?
3503
wait...
3503
this is the title?
3503
how do you even say them in casual conversation?
3503
ok, i just think it's still cumbersome and completely illogical.
3503
well, i've got one of your godly players helping me now, so we can't be in such bad shape.
3503
GC gave me a map.
3503
and showed me a shortcut.
3503
ok.
3503
umm...
3503
uh, sorry i guess?
3503
i don't know why you guys are doing this to yourselves.
3503
all this time jackassery, it's giving me a headache.
3503
ok.
3503
i like how you guys have basically resorted to trolling each other, through us.
3503
oh, did you talk to jade yet?
3503
ummm, that's what you said you wanted to do last time you talked to me, i dunno.
3503
yeah, you told me dude.
3503
want me to paste the conversation?
3503
ok.
3503
but next time you talk to me, you might want to tell me to calm down first so i don't just block you.
3503
back then i won't really want to hear from you.
3503
later.
3504
it was carcino.
3504
yeah, sorta.
3504
he has no idea what you're doing.
3504
oh, he said to give you a message...
3504
he wants you to touch his bone lump or something.
3504
and that he's pretty much basically in love with you.
3504
yeah, i dunno, pretty much.
3504
ohhh no, we're not going down that road!
3504
besides, it was a private conversation among private gentlemen colleagues.
3504
oh, also you're going to punch him.
3504
i guess in your future.
3504
but in your pretty soon future i think.
3504
it's when he says stuff to you and then you laugh at him.
3504
also he says you said it's from me.
3504
pffff, i don't care!
3504
i'm just the timey-wimey messenger here.
3505
oh, wow.
3505
what's that?
3505
my denizen?
3505
ok...
3505
so you want me to go down there and kill him?
3505
won't that be, uh, kinda hard?
3505
oh?
3505
so what's my advantage?
3505
um, ok.
3505
what's the point of releasing the grist hoard?
3505
is it just so i can make tons more sweet loot?
3505
what's the ultimate alchemy?
3505
alright.
3506
so this is the seventh gate?
3506
that'll take me into the palace and down to the sleeping denizen?
3533
the rocket pack?
3533
ok...
3533
but you can't just "subtract" object codes from other codes!
3533
it's like, mathematically, um...
3533
ambiguous.
3533
like just reverse AND/OR'ing the flower pot alone could make hundreds of possibilities.
3533
subtracting all three could be millions!
3533
wow, what?
3533
oh man, you have a hacker??
3533
i bet he is THE BEST!!!!
3533
hackers are always the best.
3533
who is it?
3533
have i talked to him?
3533
uh, ok.
3533
brb then.
3534
ok here...
3534
dskjhsdk
3534
um, no.
3534
they sort of are random.
3534
but it's the right code, i promise!
3535
hello?
3535
it thought you said you'd be back in less than a second?
3535
oh...
3535
i just thought that was just you going off to get the code...
3535
and making like this rockety noise or something, i dunno.
3535
because you're kind of goofy.
3535
oh gosh, i'm sooooo sorry!
3535
this is just a stupid code, i'm sorry.
3535
are you sure it's right, it seems kind of...
3535
obvious.
3535
bluuuh, oh man, i got so served, bluuuuuuuuuh!
3535
well you see, the explanation is perfectly simple and scientific.
3535
it was because shut up.
3535
shut up is why.
3535
i guess i'll make this rocket now.
3535
and see if this dumbass code actually does the trick.
3537
in where?
3537
oh, already?
3537
huh, i guess time flew by while i was doing other stuff.
3537
how did it go?
3537
with you and jade i guess?
3537
ew dog! ewwww!
3537
so nasty! gross dude!!!
3537
i'm in a rocket pack and i am about to blast off into space.
3537
it should be sweet.
3537
hmm...
3537
have you asked rose?
3537
wow, really?
3537
i don't really know, i mean...
3537
it's supposed to be like your ghostly spirit guide or something.
3537
unless you have the remains of a wise old dead grandparent lying around, i'm not sure what to tell you!
3537
i don't know, just do what it says!
3537
it knows stuff about the game, so it probably knows better than i do...
3537
i gotta go!
3537
gonna blast off to the seventh gate.
3537
and, uh, win this game i guess.
3537
later.
3546
in where?
3546
oh, already?
3546
huh, i guess time flew by while i was doing other stuff.
3546
how did it go?
3546
with you and jade i guess?
3546
ew dog! ewwww!
3546
so nasty! gross dude!!!
3546
i'm in a rocket pack and i am about to blast off into space.
3546
it should be sweet.
3546
hmm...
3546
have you asked rose?
3546
wow, really?
3546
i don't really know, i mean...
3546
it's supposed to be like your ghostly spirit guide or something.
3546
unless you have the remains of a wise old dead grandparent lying around, i'm not sure what to tell you!
3546
i don't know, just do what it says!
3546
it knows stuff about the game, so it probably knows better than i do...
3546
i gotta go!
3546
gonna blast off to the seventh gate.
3546
and, uh, win this game i guess.
3546
later.
3547
what?
3547
ugh...
3548
huh?
3548
pfffff.
3548
lame.
3548
what kind of gullible stooge do you think i am?
3549
this is like some terrible april fools prank.
3549
but 13 days too late.
3549
remember, you are talking to the pranking MASTER.
3549
if future you is real, then why don't you let me talk to him.
3549
hold on, someone else is bugging me.
3549
hahaha!
3549
wow, you're really pulling out all the stops for this stunt!
3549
using your phone and computer at the same time to message me.
3549
you're kind of going through a lot of trouble actually, i don't know why you're bothering with this.
3549
you can't track down through time WHAT YOU CAN'T CATCH!
3549
pchoooooo!
3549
no...
3549
but that would have been sweet if i did just then.
3549
ok, i guess...
3566
yeah, of course!
3566
there was no way i wasn't trying out this sweet ride.
3566
relax, i'm not going through the gate!
3566
i am just flying around, and having a good time in the sky.
3566
um...
3566
ok, i don't know anything about that...
3566
but it doesn't matter!
3566
you're my best bro, and if you say not to go then i won't go.
3566
hey, can you hold on?
3566
i'm getting trolled again.
3566
ok, brb.
3567
humans aren't hatched as larvae dummy.
3567
we don't hatch at all.
3567
we are born as these like little pink monkeys called babies.
3567
what did i say?
3567
i thought you didn't like going down that road?
3567
copy-pasting future/past conversations...
3567
i dunno, that's what you just told me.
3567
hahaha!
3567
i was punking you dude!
3567
or at least i will be in our next conversation.
3567
thanks for the great prank idea.
3567
i don't know, it was just a friendly prank.
3567
don't you ever play pranks?
3567
i mean, of course you do, one of you just tried to prank me good.
3567
pffffff, you'll find out.
3567
well, we're friends by then, aren't we?
3567
or sort of like, uh, reverse anti-mutual friends.
3567
look, you're going to have to face it at some point...
3567
that you're learning the meaning of this human emotion called friendship.
3567
yes, absolutely.
3567
dude, you've been doing the same exact thing!!!
3567
you never answer my questions, though.
3567
how am i supposed to know what's going on, or what you're alluding to?
3567
ok...
3567
what's the point of the game.
3567
augh!
3567
fine.
3567
where are you now?
3567
no no, i know that!
3567
you already told me.
3567
yes, in your future.
3567
what i mean is...
3567
are you in your house right now, or in one of your magical lands, or what?
3567
just curious cause you can see me, but i can't see or know anything about you!
3567
what's that?
3567
derse?
3567
well jeez, how am i supposed to know any of this??
3567
ok, so the veil is a bunch of meteors...
3567
what do you mean "what's left of it"?
3567
ok...
3567
so then it's up to us to save it?
3567
ok, but it sounds like we've got plenty of time before that happens, right?
3567
oh no...
3567
what is it?
3567
yeah, well...
3567
maybe you're wrong!
3567
maybe there's something we can still do to stop it, if you just help us?
3567
ok, we'll see about that, mr. sourbulge.
3567
hey, aren't you kind of uncomfortable sitting on a meteor?
3567
are you all huddled in a crater or something?
3567
seeds?
3567
um...
3567
well, what kind of crazy shit is there?
3567
weird.
3567
wow, i don't think i'm following this.
3567
ok, but wait...
3567
can you give a message to GC for me?
3567
tell her nice try.
3567
oh, well i thought you'd be cool with it since you asked me to give her a message for you last time.
3567
but whatever.
3584
what's this?
3584
oh man, let me drop everything and go there, because i'm in such a huge hurry to take more of your advice!
3584
yeah, well, dave said i did, and i believe him!
3584
i don't know, i thought you were ok for a while, but now you are kind of giving me the creeps!
3584
what?
3584
you mean my earth jesus?
3584
do you have a troll jegus?
3584
wow, really?
3584
or is this a joke?
3584
well...
3584
neither do i, i guess.
3584
it's pretty much not anything.
3584
um...
3584
ok.
3584
i'll take a look.
3592
ARGH!
3592
she tricked me again.
3592
GC.
3592
she told me how to get to the 2nd gate.
3592
so i went through, but it took me to rose's house instead.
3592
another prank!
3592
oh...
3592
then, i don't really get this.
3592
wow, ok.
3592
ok...
3592
how do you know all this?
3592
oh yeah...
3592
you're the orange dave.
3592
hey no offense, but do you think i could talk to the real dave for a second?
3592
wow, calm down!
3592
i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant...
3592
i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is...
3592
the dave from my time is also my friend, and i guess he's in the same boat i'm in, not knowing stuff and all.
3592
and i'd feel bad keeping him out of the loop!
3592
oh, hey.
3592
i think i pissed off your future self.
3592
i said he wasn't the real dave.
3592
i think i might have really hurt his feelings though!
3592
why not?
3592
ok.
3592
i'm in rose's room by the way.
3592
yeah, but she's asleep!
3592
ok.
3592
sure!
3592
hey dave...
3592
in case i forgot to say so before...
3592
thanks for saving my life!
3593
man, i don't know how i feel about that!
3593
i don't really like the idea of capering around her room while she's asleep, it feels weird.
3593
i'm going to wake her up.
3593
a future thing?
3593
well, yeah, she won't wake up.
3593
so i guess so.
3593
but i'm not snooping!!!
3593
yeah.
3593
they look sorta like journals.
3593
i don't think i should read those!
3593
uh, ok.
3594
umm...
3594
wait a minute!
3594
i see what you're trying to do.
3594
i won't tell you the code for rose's books!
3594
ok...
3594
i guess.
3594
yeah there's a code.
3594
HAHA DAVE,
3594
I THINK ALL THIS LAUGHING MADE ME POOP IN MY PANTS TOO HARD.
3594
oh, yeah, i think it might be.
3594
yeah, maybe.
3594
i wonder if she finished...
3594
she was so tight lipped about the damn thing! i am really curious.
3640
so what is this?
3640
the thing the code made...
3640
how do you know?
3640
i thought you couldn't use hammers.
3640
who's that?
3640
you killed him for it?
3640
how'd you get it then?
3640
ok.
3803
what point?
3803
oh man, i must be getting closer to the conversations where you're trolling me harder!
3803
this is pretty exciting, i can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve.
3803
anyway, you weren't making a point about the ultimate riddle, dude.
3803
nope, we never talked about it.
3803
yet...
3803
oh, you're just starting to figure that out now?
3803
oh my god, i know, you've already told me like a million times!!!
3803
man, i've got to say i'm a little disappointed by this "masterful trolling" you were bragging about.
3803
maybe, but that would be pretty weak too!!!
3803
w/e.
3803
so what was the "case in point" you were making, anyway?
3803
whoa, i am?
3803
wait...
3803
these are baby versions of us?
3803
well...
3803
i saw footage of my nanna, and some other people who i am pretty sure were like jade's grandpa and rose's mom and stuff from a long time ago.
3803
and then...
3803
there were all these little guys scurrying around.
3803
so they are like cloned copies of us?
3803
huh?
3803
what do you mean they are literally us?
3803
do they go back in time?
3803
what is the riddle anyway?
3803
maybe i can guess, i am good at riddles!
3803
a distaction, perhaps?
3803
nevermind.
3803
ok.
3803
well, if i run into some salamanders who tell me all about this riddle and get really excited about it, i will try to act surprised.
3803
so this is the same kind of thing you went through?
3803
with, like, being your own paradox clones and creating your own parents and stuff?
3803
how did that even work, with 12 of you?
3803
huh...
3803
yeah, i guess now that you mention it, i am finding it all a little strange...
3803
no, no, i mean the ghost stuff and paradoxes are one thing of course...
3803
it's something else.
3803
it's just...
3803
this is really weird...
3803
well, normally humans hatch...
3803
from like these slimy pods.
3803
then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.
3803
(hehehehehehehe)
3803
um...
3803
sure...?
3803
hey, i have an idea.
3803
why don't you get back to me in a few minutes?
3803
i mean like a few minutes of my time, not yours.
3803
all of these little pink monkeys are getting way out of line and i have to tend to them.
3803
if you message me in a couple minutes, we can continue conversing in a sane, linear fashion for a change!
3803
and then after that you can keep going backwards and then make fun of me riding my little red rocket.
3803
you can tell me i look like a silly little paradox clone fresh out of my slime tube and this is just all a big nurseytime recess jamboree.
3803
that would burn me good!
3803
(hehehehehehehehehehehe)
3807
yeah!
3807
wait!
3807
i was just looking at all these rascals, and i was wondering...
3807
how they go back in time and become us and stuff.
3807
does it have something to do with the reckoning?
3807
you told me.
3807
we had this great dare going.
3807
to see who could be the least helpful and informative.
3807
and you totally lost, dude!
3807
you were hella helpful.
3807
oh, wow.
3807
is that the title of a movie too?
3807
ha ha, that isn't even true and doesn't make sense!
3807
well yeah, the dare never happened, i was joking around and made that up to give you hard time.
3807
i am wearing a lab coat!
3807
sort of...
3807
that's bullshit!
3807
do you even have elves?
3807
uh, what?
3807
ok.
3807
wait!!!
3807
so that means...
3807
we are all sort of like superman?
3807
cool!
3807
yeah, superman is pretty cool, i guess.
3807
did you know nicolas cage was almost going to play superman one time?
3807
wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3807
get back to me in a couple minutes, ok?
3829
sure, i guess.
3829
what are you talking about?
3829
ok...
3829
i was sort of mulling it over while looking at all these babies with guns and sitting on ponies and things...
3829
and how the reckoning takes them back.
3829
and how you said our reckoning starts sooner.
3829
are you sure it has to start so soon? can't we delay it?
3829
oh... dang!
3829
i guess i better get off this meteor then!
3829
ok, well you keep saying how doomed we are and how all this bad stuff happens sooner, but you never say why!
3829
what happens in our game that's different from yours that makes things go so badly?
3830
who is jack noir?
3830
so you didn't have him in your game?
3830
i see.
3830
so after he got exiled and all that, he came here into our game and caused all this trouble?
3830
ummmm...
3830
crash bandicoot?
3830
like an ace?
3830
ok, i think i get it.
3830
but how did he do that? what was different about what we did versus what you did?
3830
oh no!
3830
what is the worst thing?
3830
dammit!
3830
oh, hey...
3830
sorry, hold on, this little lady is bugging me about something.
3830
oh!!!!!
3830
oh man, i just had THE BEST idea, this is so perfect.
3830
a blonde mother and daughter together, this is totally perfect.
3830
it is like that scene in con air, i will give her the bunny like i am nick cage fresh out of the slammer.
3830
i wish i had a filthy wifebeater on, oh well.
4528
hi karkat!
4528
oh man.
4528
this is it, isn't it?
4528
i've been looking forward to this!
4528
no, i mean this is the first conversation between us, from your perspective.
4528
right?
4528
yeah, lots of times!
4528
actually...
4528
i should introduce myself properly.
4528
hi karkat, i am john!
4528
because we are buddies!
4528
yup, we totally are.
4528
we just became earth human buddies in a kind of weird way.
4528
you decide to keep talking to me backwards through my adventure.
4528
and then when you are done with that you come back and talk to me more recently on the timeline for a while.
4528
you talk to my friends a whole bunch too.
4528
you and your alternian troll buddies help me and my earth human buddies hatch a plan!
4528
which we are busy putting into motion right now, as you can see.
4528
yeah yeah, i know.
4528
you mean the scratch?
4528
yes! that is the plan.
4528
you yourself said it was the only hope now.
4528
heheheh.
4528
egbert.
4528
man...
4528
i knoooow.
4528
none of this is news to me, karkat!
4528
but to be quite honest, it doesn't sound like your intentions were all that great.
4528
wanting to be tyrants and all.
4528
maybe you got what you deserved, you stutid fuckass!
4528
eh, it's an in-joke, never mind.
4528
anyway, hey!
4528
i thought this was supposed to be the conversation where you do all that AMAAAAAZING TROLLING!
4528
come on bro, flame me!
4528
i have been really excited about this.
4528
um...
4528
i don't know, probably not.
4528
i just think it's kind of funny when you do it.
4528
right about what?
4528
ha ha, i don't hate you!
4528
wait...
4528
are you saying that we are kisme-whatevers?
4528
er...
4528
uh.
4528
well...
4528
i just didn't really have any idea that you had any sort of feelings like that, so i am kind of caught off guard.
4528
hey, i don't have a problem with your weird sort of alien hate-love thing!
4528
it is just that, uh...
4528
i am not a homosexual.
4528
it is like, when a boy likes another boy.
4528
or i guess hates, in this case.
4528
yes.
4528
shrug. it just is.
4528
i am just as confused by your troll shenanigans.
4528
so many shenanigans!
4528
anyway, i kind of got the impression that you and terezi were a thing.
4528
like, i dunno.
4528
going on weird fight dates and beating the crap out of each other, and being in hate-love or love-hate.
4528
isn't that how it works?
4528
ew.
4528
um, i talked to you...
4528
and her...
4528
and some others. i don't know! like i said it's just a sense i got.
4528
sorry!
4528
oh god, the quadrants...
4528
ok, sheesh!
4528
karkat, i am going to be honest...
4528
this first conversation is not going how i thought it would at all!
4528
it is really kind of...
4528
awkward.
4528
yeah...
4528
well...
4528
um...
4528
yeah, well we never really talked about it in the past, so i guess we do agree to that.
4528
told you bro!!!!!!!
4528
hahahaha.
4528
you mean platonic hate?
4528
oh yeah.
4528
oh boy, this sounds great.
4528
but...
4528
we're out of time!
4528
i have to go put this plan into motion.
4528
:D
4528
see you soon!
4553
heheh. i am pronouncing that like a really long "june".
4553
that is so many o's.
4553
you typed my name in 64 bit.
4553
have i talked to you before?
4553
i'm pretty sure i remember you. you hassled me a long time ago.
4553
i think you threatened to kill me at some point.
4553
well, yeah, i know that about you guys by now.
4553
but also i know that it is probably not exactly an empty threat!
4553
since one of you already managed to trick me into getting myself killed.
4553
well, in another timeline at least.
4553
terezi?
4553
huh. it never really occurred to me to ask what your names are.
4553
kinda rude of me!
4553
what is yours?
4553
man, that sounds so made up!
4553
but if you say so, marquise.
4553
oh, ok.
4553
ok, i will be sure to let my guard down.
4553
psyche!!!!!!!!!
4553
oh damn, that was 9 !'s.
4553
!!!!!!!1
4553
shit!
4553
never mind.
4553
anyway, nice meeting you spinneret.
4553
if you don't mind, i would like to try to go back to sleep.
4553
i was dreaming about something important.
4553
oh god, i forgot!
4553
poor jade... :(
4553
i hope she is alright.
4553
yeah, you're right.
4553
i have to hurry and go save her!
4553
see ya!
4553
oh yeah...
4553
duh, stupid stupid dumb.
4553
do you know where i am supposed to get it?
4553
hmm...
4553
ok?
4553
meh.
4553
so, you seem to like 8's a whole bunch, and i guess you are like, kind of spidery themed or something?
4553
haha, spiders are gross!
4561
jade is not answering!
4561
are you sure she's ok?
4561
oh...
4561
you mean carcino geneticist?
4561
heheh. car cat. that is how i am saying that.
4561
beep beep, meow!
4561
i will have to remember to give him a hard time about that.
4561
it is really not hard to do that.
4561
i never even saw prospit.
4561
aside from flaming bits and pieces of it i guess.
4561
something happened, and it blew up, and dream jade died, and then i was wandering around this place that was like a chess board with a huge crater in it, with loads of dead black and white guys everywhere.
4561
oh, huh.
4561
my dad was there.
4561
um, you know...
4561
my guardian?
4561
yes. if by hive you mean house.
4561
um...
4561
these observations are very alien of you.
4561
but that's pretty cool i guess, seeing as you are an alien.
4561
the funny thing is, he is not even really my dad.
4561
i mean, i was adopted by him, although we are not actually unrelated, i think.
4561
he is the son of my grandmother, who isn't really my grandmother...
4561
nanna is sort of like my biological mother, and my biological father would be jade's grandpa, sorta.
4561
both of which i just created, with slime and stuff, and sent back in time as babies.
4561
so i guess, if anything, that makes my dad...
4561
my half brother???
4561
tell me about it!
4562
but i know where i'm going!
4562
terezi already made me a map.
4562
first she made a really crappy one, then a really nice one that works kind of like google.
4562
she started helping me after she tried to kill me.
4562
wow, how could i possibly know that!
4562
you mean like a candle light hate date?
4562
oh...
4562
well then, thanks, i guess?
4562
why do you want to be so helpful, anyway?
4562
i mean, with her i got the sense she was being kind of jokestery about it, which is something i can understand.
4562
but why bother helping, if we aren't going to win anyway?
4562
you guys.
4562
it is practically all you ever say.
4563
that is nice to know.
4563
yes, i think i would be.
4563
but why else?
4563
we are supposed to create a universe?
4563
no!
4563
why are we supposed to do that?
4563
oh. that's true, i guess.
4563
you did?
4563
hmm...
4563
i don't know what to think about that.
4563
hurrrrr oh man what a burn!
4563
(j/k it was actually lame.)
4563
well to be honest, i never really believed any of your guys's doom and gloom nonsense.
4563
not because i think you are lying...
4563
i just feel like there must still be a way to win!
4563
yes, i agree.
4563
also, there is always hope for someone who has good friends to count on!
4572
um, i don't know. you can see my future, can't you?
4572
how much time am i wasting?
4572
then i would venture to guess i am wasting time because you chose to pester me just now!
4572
i mean, i was just pausing for a moment...
4572
to look at my trashed movie posters.
4572
they bring back memories, of a life that i guess is long gone now.
4572
but you probably know what that is all about.
4572
it wasn't even that long ago, but it already seems like forever since i was on earth!
4572
it was a pretty nice place, i bet you would have liked it.
4572
well, what about you? do you miss your planet, and your parents and such?
4572
oh. that's too bad.
4572
but you see, that is where you are wrong. these films are the finest earth has to offer!
4572
no, no. i drew those clowns in my sleep, for some reason.
4572
this one here is so great. it is about this street tough renegade who did hard time behind bars, and wants nothing more in the world than to reunite with his loving wife and daughter. but not so fast! he has to go on crazy and dangerous escapades through the sky with a motley assortment of rogues led by john malkovich, who is wise to cage's heroic nature and pure heart. they tether a grumpy police man's awesome car to the plane and smash it, and then later they crash into some casinos. cage gets out of the wreckage and hugs his family, and i usually tear up a little.
4572
that is my working troll title for the movie, i hope it was ok.
4572
yeah, well you are hilariously WRONG!
4572
here, hang on, i will show you.
4572
http://tinyurl.com/hullohumminburr
4572
oh, but you will probably have to use your troll thingy to rewind time or whatever, to before the earth internet blew up so you can watch it.
4572
i guess??
4572
ok, suit yourself.
4572
but there it is, in case you are ever hankering after some incredible movie magic.
4572
ok, good idea.
4573
oh, the goggles are cool and all, but they kind of restrict my vision stupidly when i'm using them!
4573
i should remember to make a new hands-free device, that is less obtrusive.
4573
maybe after i make a new computer so i can install this game.
4573
yeah, but i can use one of my old previously punched cards.
4573
what?
4573
put what away? what are you talking about?
4574
my pail?
4574
you mean this bucket here?
4574
umm...
4574
i'm really not following. what do you have against buckets?
4574
shame over what?
4574
it's just a bucket! you know, for putting soapy water in and cleaning stuff with.
4574
why, what do trolls use them for?
4574
wow... uh. that is definitely pretty odd.
4574
but ok, i'm sorry you saw my bucket. i will just chuck it out the window i guess.
4574
well i was GOING to but you started babbling at me!
4574
jeez, spinneret.
4574
ok, then what is it!
4574
*ROLLS EYES*
4574
all eight gross spidery eyes!
4574
oops i mean !x8.
4574
oh yeah.
4582
hey rose!
4582
how are you doing? i don't even remember the last time we talked.
4582
i have been so busy.
4582
and it looks like you have been too.
4582
i mean, hopy shit!
4582
my house is HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE!
4582
oh.
4582
well, it must have cost a fortune!
4582
how much?
4582
torrented?
4582
you got her to do that? but she's an old lady! also, a ghost.
4582
also, she is really tricky, and plays lots of pranks.
4582
did she try to prank you?
4582
huh.
4582
i guess you enjoyed the prankster's gambit on that exchange then.
4582
oh yeah...
4582
what's up with the alchemiter?
4582
it looks weird.
4582
did you get nanna to do that too?
4582
the salamanders??
4582
they aren't very smart...
4582
i'm surprised they even understand what to do.
4582
yeah...
4582
uh...
4582
what exactly does that mean?
4582
what have you been doing this whole time???
4582
well,
4582
i have been talking to a lot of trolls, for one thing.
4582
they sure are a talkative bunch!
4582
and then i cloned some slime babies in the veil.
4582
yes. um...
4582
ok, long story short is, jade is my slime clone sister, and dave is your slime clone brother, and we were all born today!
4582
yes?
4582
oh.
4582
umm...
4582
then i fell asleep, and woke up on the battlefield.
4582
oh!
4582
rose, i am fairly sure i saw your mom!
4582
well, it was a nice and proper looking lady, with a pink scarf, so...
4582
i dunno, who else would that be!
4582
fine, i guess...
4582
she was with my dad.
4582
yeah!
4582
happy?
4582
wow, i dunno.
4582
i don't really know her well enough to say, i guess?
4582
plus, i was a little distracted.
4582
maybe i will find out next time i go to sleep.
4582
now stop being so spookily mysterious and tell me what you've been doing!
4582
investigating what?
4582
its scope?
4582
oh, rose, did you know that we are supposed to be creating a universe with this game?
4582
i think that's pretty neat!
4582
so you believe the trolls then?
4582
it is?
4582
that's a bit of a bummer!
4582
i am still skeptical about that, though.
4582
huh?
4582
that's stupid.
4582
i'm not your leader, i am your FRIEND, there is a BIG difference!
4582
pff.
4582
laaaaaaaame.
4582
so, if you're sure that we are going to fail...
4582
what is the point of everything we're doing?
4582
um...
4582
i mean, what are we actually shooting for here?
4582
i suddenly don't understand anything.
4605
hi...?
4605
ha ha, what?
4605
so you're a time traveler?
4605
so let me see if i have this straight...
4605
you are a time traveling space alien from the future, sent here to study humans?
4605
are you from mars? is it a mission of peace?
4605
what does your time machine look like? a phone booth? phone booths are a popular thing for some reason.
4605
were you lured to earth by a huge gyroscopey thing that jodie foster piloted in contact, while matthew mcconaughey sort of acted as her spiritual guide i guess...
4605
and then he kind of preached to her about having faith instead of believing in the sciences so hard all the time, and i guess in the end she believed him, maybe?
4605
actually, im not even sure what the point of mcconaughey was in that movie. but he was still awesome.
4605
and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.
4605
and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.
4605
because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.
4605
anyway, does that have any applicability to your cosmic interstellar astrojourney?
4605
pff, i know i'm dumber than rose, that is not much of a burn, dude!
4605
oh, sorry.
4605
i don't know why i thought you were.
4605
were you trolling rose too?
4605
TIME TRAVEL TROLLING???
4605
oh boy, let me go put on my quantum space hat, and extra terrestrial adventure boots, and you can tell me all about it.
4605
ha ha ha. i don't follow!
4605
hahaha! oh man, you blew it!
4605
now i know for sure you're trolling me. rose hates that movie.
4605
possibly! i know that sure didn't sound like her.
4605
but i think it's more likely that you made it all up cause you know i like that movie.
4605
so i tip my cap to you, well played miss troll!
4605
ok well, just between you and me...
4605
SOMEONE here is getting trolled.
4605
and it just might be all three of us.
4605
but you shoulda told me you liked little monsters!
4605
we could jam about that. what was your favorite part?
4605
i really want to get a little monsters poster, but they're hard to find!
4605
i asked my dad for one for christmas. fingers crossed!
4605
yup, that sure keeps sounding alien of you.
4605
keep up the good work!
4605
listen, i'm kind of busy, i have to wrap this present and mail it in a hurry.
4605
so i'm going to block you!
4605
but i might unblock you again soon, because you're kinda cool.
4605
yeah well...
4605
you might just hear from me!
4605
also, you should give rose another chance.
4605
she is really great! whatever she did, she was probably just pulling her mind games on you, it's all in fun.
4605
there is more to her than that, you'll see.
4605
bye!
4624
oh hey.
4624
but...
4624
it is bill cosby.
4624
he's back.
4624
in laptop form.
4624
excuse me, but spending just a little quality time with my man bill here is not a w8stey w8ste at all.
4624
no amount of 8's in words will make that true.
4624
of course i do! jeez!
4624
ok, i'm going.
4625
what?!?!?!
4625
i am going to blast off and fly a little higher, to see if i can find nanna up there!
4625
and then i will install the game.
4625
it will only take a second!
4625
jeez!!!
4625
you are incredibly bossy.
4625
more like marquise bossyfangs.
4625
no, you did not tell me that you like to play troll dungeons and dragons.
4625
i will find out what your name is, i am tricky and i have ways.
4625
i don't know what i'm going to do next!
4625
apparently what i thought i was going to do next was wrong, so why don't you tell me?
4625
has it occurred to you that i might be wasting so much time because you keep pestering me telling me how much time i'm wasting?
4625
and then when i'm about to make progress you tell me i am doing the wrong thing!
4625
if it weren't for you i would be playing this game already.
4625
but it isn't!
4625
oh...
4625
but why would i do that? my ecto labsuit is rad!
4625
:(
4625
what is a boy skylark?
4625
actually, i think i remember passing that rung on my echeladder a while ago.
4625
who cares what i dress like? it is what's inside the adventurer that counts.
4625
why are you taking such an interest in my fashion, anyway?
4625
ha ha, it sounds like you have a really lame culture.
4625
laaaaaaaame.
4625
oh, ha ha...
4625
i didn't even count. it just...
4625
turned out like that.
4625
yeah.
4625
er...
4625
ok, anyway, i will make a new suit, but i am not ditching my ectosuit!!!
4625
it is so sweet, i look like link, if zelda was a quest about an elf scientist.
4625
i am the wind waker. it's me.
4632
jegus?
4632
how do you know about jegus? do you even know what that is?
4632
no. well, yeah kind of.
4632
it is a misspelling of an adult male bearded human, who was magic.
4632
shrug!
4632
uh, yes. it is.
4632
i dunno. i found it, and i decided to captchalogue it for some reason.
4632
frogs are pretty cool.
4632
huh. ok...
4632
apparently it is considered illegal contraband.
4632
why would a frog be illegal?
4632
bossy!!!!!!!!
4632
bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy.
4632
to the eighth power.
4632
times eight infinities!!!
4632
that was nine !'s.
4634
so, uh...
4634
red sneakers, some jeans, a tee shirt, and another shirt...
4634
this is the fabulous outfit you had in mind?
4634
it's pretty cool and all...
4634
i was just picturing something...
4634
more elaborate? like maybe more adventurey.
4634
what?
4634
ok, jeeeeeeeez.
4635
pchoo.
4635
ha ha, just messin' with ya.
4635
pchoooooooo!
4636
ok...
4636
marquise bossyfangs mcsekret, this has been a lot of fun...
4636
but i have to go talk to my pals now, and also rescue jade!
4636
that's too bad.
4636
how long will it be?
4636
ha ha, i guess...
4636
ok, i will try.
4636
thanks for all the help. bye, ms. serket!
4636
Anderson.
4636
(hehehehehehehehe)
4637
hey dave!
4637
wow, it's been a while since we talked, hasn't it.
4637
i think the last time i talked to you, i was doing exactly what im doing now...
4637
which is blasting off from my house.
4637
or was it?
4637
wow, i can't remember...
4637
oh.
4637
you mean like the trolls?
4637
are you using the troll time chat gizmo?
4637
oh ok. is this dave sprite?
4637
well, excuse me, but i still think time travel sounds kind of special.
4637
sorry you are so jaded by awesome shit!
4637
what is it?
4637
boondollars? i thought they didn't do anything.
4637
what do they do?
4637
what do they buy?
4637
uh...
4637
how much do you need?
4637
oh, fuck that!!!
4637
but you just said it wasn't useless!
4637
really? when?
4637
how far in the future are you from?
4637
i thought we only had something like 24 hours until, like...
4637
game over.
4637
wow. how...
4637
i don't get how that works!
4637
but, doesn't going back in time make an alternate reality?
4637
i thought that's what happened with dave sprite, he came back to make sure i didn't die and this is a new timeline now.
4637
daves, plural?
4637
oh, man.
4637
help?
4637
sounds like you have been talkin' to some trolls!
4637
they seem to be getting more talkative lately.
4637
yeah, that makes sense.
4637
i guess since you've lived three days in one day, you've just been hassled that much more?
4637
heheh.
4637
so what is the future like?
4637
or uh, the 3x future...
4637
do we win???
4637
but...
4637
i worked hard saving up that money!
4637
i have a whole boonbuck now.
4637
:(
4637
tell me what you want with it!
4637
lohacse?
4637
um...
4637
lohac?
4637
oh, huh.
4637
that sounds unpleasant.
4637
your unpleasant face is what kicks ass!
4637
or DOESN'T, more like.
4637
j3gus?
4637
*narrows eyes suspiciously...*
4637
i don't even know how to give it to you!
4637
they are just more weird gaming abstractions, how do we do this?
4637
i'm really pretty busy you know. i have to help jade!
4637
bluh...
4637
fiiiiiiiine.
4637
who?
4684
hey vriska!
4684
ok, i still cannot find my nanna up here, so now i am just installing this game.
4684
what are you up to?
4684
why not? you guys do it all the time.
4684
bluh...
4684
that's dumb. i'm going to talk to you whenever i want!
4684
well, i didn't know it was your name for sure until you just told me now.
4684
so, haha.
4684
heheh, i am not telling.
4684
a true wise guy never reveals his tricks.
4684
nuh uh!
4684
anyway, i was just wondering if you had a chance to watch that awesome video i linked you to?
4684
you know...
4684
the one about the renegade hero who busted loose from the slammer to save the day.
4684
just do it, you won't be sorry.
4684
i mean, when you are not so busy and have less irons in the fire or whatever.
4684
ok, i am starting this game now and saving jade, like a street tough maverick with nothing to lose.
4684
see ya, vriska!
4684
oh, damn...
4685
fuck.
4688
oh no.
4688
which conversation is this for you? your second or so?
4688
i mean...
4688
the second time you have spoken to me?
4688
or first??
4688
oh.
4688
i thought you were going backwards though.
4688
memo?
4688
uh...
4688
ok.
4690
ok, i am here.
4690
oh, hi dave!
4690
what is going on in here?
4690
yeah, dave, don't go!
4690
i think we should listen to what he has to say.
4690
haha, dave you're hitting on terezi? really??
4690
karkat, is terezi really your girlfriend?
4690
what is so different about your romance?
4690
what's a quadrant? how many do you have?
4690
wow, okay!
4690
who cares, jeeeeeeeez.
4690
what does?
4690
what!
4690
no way. vriska's cool, i'll talk to her all i want!
4690
well, yeah...
4690
but terezi killed me in an alternate timeline, so that isn't too bad i guess.
4690
plus, i am pretty sure that she is sorry about it.
4690
wait...
4690
are you saying that vriska is interested in me?
4690
like, romantically?
4690
oh man.
4690
uh...
4690
i'm not sure what to think about this.
4690
dave, what do you think i should do?
4690
well, like i said, i thought she was pretty cool...
4690
kinda bossy! but also pretty friendly.
4690
mcconaughey!!!!!!!!
4690
um, wow, i don't know.
4690
i mean, yeah, sure it would be fun to do something like that with her, i think.
4690
but...
4690
beyond that, it's a little confusing!
4690
i don't think i have ever actually liked a girl before in that way, so i am not really sure what i am supposed to feel or do...
4690
uh oh!
4690
yeah, i dunno dave, i have talked to karkat a lot and i really don't think he has a thing for me.
4690
uh...
4690
er...
4690
do...
4690
you think that vriska is going to try to make out with me?
4690
rose and jade?
4690
so, uh...
4690
you want us to like, date them?
4690
i think he is right, i think we are all a little young to be thinking about that!
4690
um, also,
4690
we are kinda all related! sort of. through shared ghost slime genes. right?
4690
so, uh...
4690
wow, i have to marry rose?
4690
uh...
4690
wow.
4690
why not?
4698
nanna, what the heck!!!
4698
really?
4698
but nanna, did you know he is not really my dad? and also, i am not technically your grandson.
4698
you are actually sort of my mother.
4698
huh, oh yeah.
4698
don't you find it all a little strange?
4698
heheh.
4698
so where have you been, nanna? i have been looking all over for you.
4699
you have?
4699
yeah!
4699
now i am an ectobiolo...
4699
ectobiblio... shit!
4699
(oops! sorry.)
4699
ectobioblobabby sitter.
4699
damn it, you know what i mean.
4699
thanks!
4699
boon?
4700
ok. what is it?
4700
oh cool, that is great!
4700
hmm, i guess it has been a good while!
4700
i've been snacking on gushers a whole lot. bluh...
4700
i never realized how terrible they were, actually.
4701
oh boy!
4701
wow, hmm...
4701
uh... no?
4701
really? already?
4702
naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
4768
whoa, hey!
4768
you're awake!
4768
oh, yeah.
4768
i am pretty sure that i...
4768
he?
4768
am/is fine.
4768
i woke up on the battlefield which was on fire, and had flaming bits of prospit everywhere.
4768
oh, you mean jack?
4768
that is his name, karkat told me.
4768
i saw him there too.
4768
oh!!!!!
4768
i also got your present, and it saved my life!
4768
yes, the bunny was so awesome, it was definitely the best bunny i got today.
4768
thank you so much, jade!
4768
when jack saw it, he flew the hell away. and then the bunny and i went on an adventure together.
4768
does the bunny have a name? i asked him but i don't think he can talk.
4768
oh, i did not even think of that.
4768
well if she grew up as a girl, then it's not right for me to suddenly make her a boy.
4768
hmm...
4768
you have no idea how tempted i am to name her casey again.
4768
yes, i named a young salamander casey earlier, but then i left her at rose's house.
4768
yes, but she was asleep.
4768
also, apparently i am supposed to marry rose. karkat said so.
4768
it is true, it is a fact from an alien.
4768
heheh, i did not take him that seriously.
4768
but karkat is cool, he is angry and funny.
4768
haha, no!
4768
that sounds kind of awesome.
4768
i've got it.
4768
i will name her liv tyler.
4768
the bunny.
4768
yeah!
4768
it's too bad i can't marry liv instead of rose.
4768
the girl i mean, not the bunny.
4768
but i guess she is probably dead now, along with all the other glamorous movie stars who come out to shine on the silver screen.
4768
that's pretty sad.
4768
the lab?
4768
oh, no. why?
4768
ok. why, is there a secret in there?
4768
what is it?
4768
oh...
4768
errr...
4768
i have sort of already seen... that.
4768
not in the lab, but on the battlefield.
4768
it's ok.
4768
i was so confused and sad when i saw you lying there...
4768
i'd rather not talk about it i guess.
4768
but, i wonder...
4768
if your dream self died...
4768
then what were you just dreaming about now?
4768
ok, that's cool.
4768
oh, also...
4768
i found your ring.
4768
yes...
4768
but then i woke up, and didn't have it anymore.
4768
so i am not sure where it is now.
4768
oh, whoa.
4768
ok, i will do that.
4768
hey jade, we have a lot to catch up on, but how about later?
4768
we have to hurry, remember there is a big meteor heading for you right now?
4768
i will find out now!
4778
oh fuck!
4780
ok, we have 10 minutes and 25 seconds.
4780
why would it be significant?
4780
numbers don't always need to have significance!
4780
ok, well the number is now less than it was, and therefore less significant.
4780
and by less, i mean more! you had better hurry upstairs and make your special item.
4780
hey, what do you think we should prototype this fussy little orb with?
4780
heheheh, it seems like so long ago that rose fed mine a clown.
4780
we were just messing around, we didn't even know what we were doing.
4780
yeah...
4780
it's almost like your grandpa put all this crap here knowing we'd have to make that decision.
4780
he seems like he was an awesome guy, i would have liked to have the chance to talk to him.
4780
oh?
4780
huh...
4780
wait, are you saying we will prototype him?
4780
like i did with nanna, to bring her ghost back to life?
4780
as...
4780
another ghost?
4780
i guess that makes a lot of sense, actually.
4780
yeah, also he brought back himself from the future.
4780
who... wasn't dead, but was going to die maybe? i dunno.
4780
specifically to save my life, as well as yours, i think.
4780
yes.
4780
it's pretty neat, i guess.
4780
i just messaged him, he is not answering.
4780
ehhh, he's fine, he has been doing a lot of time traveling.
4780
i talked to him from the future, so he must be ok now to make it that far.
4780
yes, that is why we need to get you in the loop!
4780
the loop being the game. hurry upstairs! your transporty pad thingies take you straight up, right?
4780
oh, wait!!!
4780
what do we do about prototyping?
4780
we shouldn't put your grandpa in yet, unless we want lots of imps and ogres and stuff that look like your grandpa.
4780
we could put in something really lame, to make all the monsters weaker!
4780
or at the very least, more ridiculous looking.
4780
like one of these weird pictures of blue ladies lying around.
4780
what's the deal with those, anyway?
4780
i guess we could just put nothing in and see what happens.
4780
i don't see why not.
4780
maybe i will ask rose, because she suddenly understands everything for some reason.
4780
we have ten minutes to think about it.
4780
whoops! i mean a lot less than ten minutes!
4780
hurry upstairs, go go go!!!
4787
what is this thing, anyway??
4787
and why is it blocking your transporter?
4787
typheus?
4787
like the web browser?
4787
hmm, i don't know...
4787
if you think numbers always mean something, why wouldn't browser names?
4787
wow, you sure do hate that thing!
4787
i think it is pretty cool.
4787
and he is actually sort of cute to be honest, :p
4787
oh, and screw you, typheus is an awesome browser!
4787
it is old school.
4787
typheus is the best and that's really all there is to say on the matter.
4787
oh please.
4787
i will have you know, miss fancy computer dork...
4787
that i DID upgrade my computer.
4787
yes, you are talking to the proud owner of a brand new BILL COSBY COMPUTER, ok?
4787
it is a stylish laptop in the shape of none other than bill cosby, the comedy LEGEND himself.
4787
he is looking a little sly, and fatherly, and he is wearing a sweater, and he is bill cosby.
4787
i made it with my alchemiter.
4787
then you will just have to make lots of NEW awesome stuff!
4787
ok hold that thought, im going to yank this stupid monster off of the thing.
4789
augh!!!!!!!!!!!
4789
i am making such a fucking mess in here.
4790
oh, nothing.
4790
i am just dropping monsters all over the place, that is all.
4790
are you upstairs?
4790
ok, good.
4790
i left the cruxite by the lathe, as well as the punched card with the green thingy on it.
4790
you should have plenty of time to make it. no drama here!
4790
a little more than 6 minutes.
4790
in the meantime, i will try to contact rose and get this prototyping nonsense sorted out.
4790
it's so confusing...
4790
in my foolishness, i came very close to prototyping your grandpa.
4790
we very nearly had to face our grandfatherly paradox-dad as a last boss.
4790
that would probably be the worst case scenario.
4804
rose, i have a question, and i am in a hurry!
4804
so hurry up and answer!!!
4804
oh.
4804
it is?
4804
ok, haha, that's a confusing thing you said, but that topic will have to wait!
4804
jade is minutes away from entering, and i need to decide what to do with this kernel sprite.
4804
i really don't want to mess up and do something stupid.
4804
i was thinking about not prototyping at all, to not give the monsters any new powers.
4804
what do you think, rose?
4804
i thought i'd ask since you seem to know all the mysteries.
4804
yes.
4804
that is exactly what i was going to say.
4804
um...
4804
ok?
4804
bluhhhhhh...
4804
rose, tick tick tick!!!
4804
oh, wow.
4804
you mean like when i died in another dimension, because terezi hornswoggled me?
4804
what's not?
4804
oh, ok, i see.
4804
well, uh...
4804
is there anything you can tell me?
4804
what?
4804
oh no!
4804
then i guess i will not do that.
4804
why is it so bad?
4804
but...
4804
i thought you said it wasn't going to be able to make a universe anyway?
4804
wasn't it barren or something?
4804
so why is it important?
4804
OHHHHHH.
4804
why didn't you say so, of course the answer is treasure.
4804
what is the treasure exactly?
4804
what sound?
4804
aaaahh!
4804
yeah, i've got to go. we can chat about treasure later.
4804
anyway, i will sort out this prototyping silliness myself.
4804
thanks rose!
4821
blaaauuuuuuuuugh, what happened!!!!!
4821
yes, i know!
4821
on the corner of my ghost bed!
4821
in the middle of an oil ocean!
4821
for some reason!!!
4821
um...
4821
i have no idea.
4821
i don't remember what happened, i was in the middle of helping jade...
4821
and then...
4821
i guess my bed crashed?
4821
and i got knocked out i guess.
4821
i was dreaming.
4821
i couldn't have been out for that long, because my dream was really short.
4821
i was on the battlefield again.
4821
but i did not have time to seek the treasure!
4821
but...
4821
i did see a black guy wrapped up in my ghosty bed sheets.
4821
he was acting very suspicious.
4821
oh...
4821
i do not mean like, an african american or anything.
4821
like bill cosby.
4821
r.i.p. bill. :(
4821
this fellow had a hard black shell, like all the dead guys do.
4821
i followed him for a bit...
4821
and then some sorta ruckus transpired, and i woke up.
4821
and now jade won't answer!
4821
do you know if she's ok?
4821
i'm not?
4821
oh yeah...
4821
that didn't by any chance stop being a thing that was true, did it?
4821
fuck!!!
4821
rose, this is all oil! it'll all just explode any second, won't it???
4821
fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!!!!!
4822
ok, thank you rose.
4822
hey, how do you know these things anyway?
4822
can you see me somehow?
4822
oh man, really?
4822
like a magic one?
4822
can it show you the future?
4822
is that how you know what's going to happen?
4822
like what?
4822
durrrrr.
4822
oh... yeah.
4822
point taken. i guess i should be looking, huh?
4822
okay, so...
4822
with what you've learned from your dreams and gods and magic and stuff...
4822
do you have it all mapped out now? do you know everything?
4822
yeah, but...
4822
neither did i!
4822
oh yeah.
4822
ok, buuuuuut...
4822
i guess that's not all i'm talking about.
4822
you seem a little different.
4822
kind of, um... spooky?
4822
i just mean that before, it felt like we were in this adventure together, figuring stuff out as we went along.
4822
and now you have all the answers! because of magic, and other mysterious reasons!
4822
and you want to use your powers to break the game, and i still don't really understand why, and...
4822
bluh.
4822
ok, yeah, you're right.
4822
i guess i just started worryin'...
4822
that you are getting away from us!
4822
because you know everything, and you're magic, and you have a crystal ball, and a salamander, and you are basically a wizard.
4822
and that's cool, and it sure does sound fun...
4822
but i kinda think it was more fun when you just did things like read books, and tell jokes.
4822
BA-DUM PSHHH!
4822
sorry. :(
4823
well, if you do not have any objection...
4823
maybe later, i will drop by your planet again and rescue you, thus breaking the spooky spell put on you by your nefarious, shadowy masters.
4823
that way you will stop being so grimdark and ominous, and basically completely off the deep end in every way, as is now painfully obvious to anyone with a brain.
4823
yes.
4823
please write some happy stories in your journal, about lively horses, and conspicuously not about wizards, or sadness.
4823
yes, this is good.
4823
you see rose, these are jokes.
4823
this are what they look like, do not be alarmed.
4823
laughs, rose. laaaughs.
4823
also, those crescenty looking holes where laughs come out of?
4823
those are smiles!
4823
observe... :D
4823
ok, i will wait patiently.
4823
no, rose!
4823
that sort of nonsense is exactly what is out of the question!
4823
i see things are more urgent than i realized.
4823
i will have to venture there straightaway, and slap you right out of that silly old trance!
4823
oh.
4823
well shit.
4823
oh yeah.
4823
what is this treasure, anyway?
4823
and how's it gonna save us!
4823
tell me anyway!
4823
...
4823
you're right, that is the shittiest sounding treasure i have ever heard.
4824
so what is this tumor supposed to do?
4824
and what is the significance of...
4824
removing it, i guess?
4824
does that mean im curing the battlefield or something?
4824
like the planet's doctor?
4824
hello?????
4824
rose?????????????
4824
by what?
4824
????????????????????????????????
4824
i will?
4824
um...
4824
which ones are those?
4824
uh... karkat and vriska?
4824
oh god, i was right. there they are now.
4824
how did you know?
4824
wait!!!
4824
there's stuff you didn't tell me!
4824
what happened with jade? did i mess anything up with the prototyping??
4824
aaaugh, why can't i remember!!!!!
4824
don't go yet rose, tell me!
4824
rose???????
4824
BLUH BLUH
4824
HUGE WITCH
4825
karkat!!!!!!!!!!
4825
hey, shut up a second!
4825
i need you to be nice for a change and do me a favor...
4825
have you talked to jade recently?
4825
can you tell me what happened to her??
4825
uh...
4825
hmm.
4825
jade is the girl who i am pretty sure just entered our session.
4825
she is my client player.
4825
um, yeah... i thought you knew that? you talked to her a bunch of times, apparently.
4825
oh!
4825
ok, i see what is going on here.
4825
we are finally getting to our first couple of conversations. cool!
4825
so... the smell is from a foot... but also from funeral flowers?
4825
this metaphor is confusing.
4825
yeah, i know!
4825
this is all that big time trolling i was looking forward to.
4825
and it's pretty good so far, and ordinarily i would be excited to hear more...
4825
but i really am concerned about what happened with jade!
4825
my request for a favor still stands, even though this is early you, and you still think you hate me.
4825
ok, fine! you hate me sooooo much, like, for real.
4825
can you just tell me what's up with jade?
4825
can you see her?
4825
can you tell me what happened? what did she do that was so bad?
4825
ok!!! i'm an idiot! can you just tell me anyway????
4825
whoa...
4825
the ground is shaking...
4825
what's going on?
4825
so tell me what i fucking did!!!
4825
yes!
4825
please, no more stalling or "i already told you's" or any other maddening nonsense!
4825
just...
4825
TELL ME!
4825
:|
4834
jade prototyped a lusus?
4834
what's that?
4834
oh, you mean her dog!
4834
so, she prototyped becquerel?
4834
why is that so bad?
4835
what properties?
4835
uh oh...
4837
huh...
4837
yeah, it kind of does.
4837
i'm sorry karkat, i didn't realize we screwed up so bad.
4838
oh, yeah, i know.
4838
you're really gonna tear me apart!
4838
i just feel kind of bad i fell asleep, i don't know what came over me.
4838
maybe i ate too much lasagna.
4839
who?
4839
betrayed?
4839
um, ok.
4840
er...
4840
not really.
4841
i suppose it was...
4841
but meh, it is all water under the bridge.
4841
which is where trolls and their shenanigans belong!
4841
oh, there will be lots of great material. just wait until i start handing out rabbits, you will love that.
4841
yeah, i should get going too.
4841
my friend is pestering me, and i doubt she likes to be kept waiting.
4841
(she is sort of the bossy type!)
4841
ummm...
4841
yeah, you're right, it is probably of no significance to you whatsoever.
4841
(hehehehe)
4874
hey vriska, sorry to keep you waiting!
4874
yeah, i know.
4874
um, sorry to cut this short, but this isn't really the best time to chat!
4874
i am in the middle of an ocean of oil that is ablaze with a lot of green fire.
4874
i need to figure out a way to escape!
4874
unfortunately, i fell asleep for some reason, and my bed landed here.
4874
i can't believe i was so stupid.
4874
you were?
4874
um...
4874
you can do that?
4874
hmm.
4874
what do you mean, "limit"?
4874
are you saying you can usually do more than that?
4874
ok, that is pretty cool i guess...
4874
but...
4874
why???
4874
why would you put me to sleep and put me in this predicament?
4874
ok, but...
4874
i kind of get that, but it's also kind of odd...
4874
if you're seeing my future, and you know those things are the outcome, then why are you going back and...
4874
i guess, involving yourself with these events? see what i mean?
4874
ok, that...
4874
SORT OF makes sense, i guess.
4874
but it's kind of hurting my head to think about!
4874
ah HA!
4874
so you did watch that video I sent.
4874
what did you think?
4875
yessssssss, i knew it!
4875
no, it would look so stupid!
4875
i thought you didn't want to get sidetracked!!!
4875
anyway, putting me to sleep and landing me in hot water is one thing...
4875
but you sort of indirectly caused a MUCH BIGGER problem!
4875
before i fell asleep, i was about to prototype something really ridiculous to make jack weaker.
4875
i am pretty sure that it would have made jack lose both eyes, both arms, and give him silly blue hair, and possibly also make him be a girl?
4875
he probably would have been pretty easy to beat!!!
4875
but instead, it was prototyped by jade's first guardian dog lusus.
4875
and now he is unstoppable!
4875
and he becomes the one who is stirrin' up all that trouble in your session too!
4875
i mean, it sounds like your intentions were good, but you probably didn't realize to what extent you were messing everything up!
4875
what????????
4875
vriska, why would you do that!
4875
but!
4875
no!
4875
why should i calm down when you just said you deliberately sabotaged all of us?
4875
but what does that mean!
4875
i don't know if that makes sense!
4875
i mean, it kind of does...
4875
but something doesn't really add up about it.
4875
if you knew he was going to be created regardless of what anyone did...
4875
why did you decide to involve yourself that way?
4875
like the way you are involving yourself with me becoming a hero or whatever?
4875
augh!
4875
BUT WHYYYYYYYY!
4876
that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.
4876
i am not bitter! i just think your plan is dumb.
4876
if he is as strong as karkat says, he will probably kill you!
4876
er...
4876
is luck actually a real thing?
4876
you sound pretty cocky! you should be careful about that, that is totally how people have bigtime downfalls.
4876
especially when they act kind of nefarious!!!
4876
wow, uh...
4876
i am not sure who would make me more nervous, you or jack.
4876
you really think we will meet?
4876
so...
4876
um, if we meet...
4876
are you going to...
4876
uh.
4876
like,
4876
when you see me,
4876
karkat said that...
4876
you might...
4876
oh jeez, i dunno.
4876
never mind.
4876
bluhhhhhhhh.
4876
if you say so.
4876
wait!
4876
what am i about to doooooooo!
4876
o.
4876
there, that was a 9th o. you don't even deserve 8!!!!!!!!
4876
whoops...
4884
oh, hey.
4884
who's pupa?
4884
did what?
4884
you mean, this windy thing here?
4981
ok, i think i'm ready to take this legendary nap!
4981
and then climb the god tiers, i guess?
4981
yeah...
4981
maybe it is a little TOO exciting.
4981
i am not sleepy at all!
4981
also, this is not much of a bed. more like a really hard slab of rock.
4981
i don't see how i will be able to sleep.
4981
um...
4981
you mean, you're asking me this time, instead of just doing it?
4981
what happened to you wanting to be responsible for me becoming a hero!
4981
well...
4981
i'm supposed to go to sleep to realize my destiny...
4981
and you have the ability to make me do that, so...
4981
i don't really see the harm in that.
4981
it sounds like it is just the practical thing to do.
4981
yes, that is my decision.
4981
vriska, please put me to sleep!
5315
hey jade, are you there? i have a computer now.
5315
this boring guy keeps blinking at me though, and it's weird.
5315
hi!
5315
sorry i disappeared after you entered the game...
5315
but from what i have seen in the clouds, it doesn't look like you have had much trouble making progress!
5315
oh, nice!
5315
dave is serving ALL the ladies, isn't he?
5315
he is like a dude on butler island.
5315
i mean, a dude who happens to be one of the butlers...
5315
doing a lot of serving, to various ladies who are vacationing at this snooty resort.
5315
wait, i am fucking this up.
5315
ok, good.
5315
all i am saying is, why can't i have a dave butler too?
5315
thank you.
5315
what is the equipment you're deploying?
5315
hmm... i don't think so. not recently anyway.
5315
he has? but i thought he "hated" you!
5315
yes, this is what i have concluded about him as well.
5315
he is a pretty great guy. i am really looking forward to more of his outbursts, especially his first conversation with me, which i am to understand will be legendary.
5315
but we shouldn't tell him we said any of this, or he will be "furious"!
5315
so what else have you been up to?
5315
we should try to catch up as much as possible!
5315
oh man.
5315
you will never guess what i am doing right now.
5315
go ahead, try to guess, you will not succeed.
5315
oh god dammit!
5316
how do you know!
5316
do you have rose's crystal ball?
5316
argh, i am surrounded by real life witches!
5316
everyone i know is turning magic, it's ridiculous.
5316
including me! i'm magic now.
5316
no, he is neither a chauffeur, nor a familiar...
5316
he is just a new friend!
5316
also, this is not a magic car, it is an ordinary car.
5316
i found it in my dad's wallet.
5316
yes, i just found his wallet on the ground.
5316
but my dad was nowhere to be found. :(
5316
the clouds led me to the wallet though, so maybe they will keep leading me to him?
5316
ok.
5316
i have seen lots of interesting things in the clouds...
5316
i guess you used to see things like that all the time, right?
5316
wow, uh...
5316
well, lots of things that were mysterious and didn't make much sense...
5316
but also lots of things i recognized.
5316
like stuff i have done before. and also stuff i will do in the future.
5316
and things that rose and dave have been up to...
5316
and you too!
5316
well, i saw you on your island, and saw you sleeping in a floating bed, and...
5316
i saw your pretty snow planet...
5316
and i saw you with some frogs...
5316
have you found any frogs yet?
5316
well, i saw you once in a neat outfit...
5316
it was kind of like you were torn from the pages of my favorite japanese mangas.
5316
and the snow was melting.
5316
and you were surrounded by frogs for some reason!
5316
heh, now it sounds like i am describing a weird dream i had about you.
5316
which i guess is sorta true?? anyway, i guess that must not have happened yet.
5316
dunno! but you are a witch, remember.
5316
witches LOVE frogs.
5316
i doubt it, it looked to me like a friendly gathering.
5316
oh, and one time i saw a green version of you with pointy ears, and you were crying!
5316
did that happen yet?
5316
oh no!
5316
what happened? where is she now?
5316
wow jade, you really have been up to a lot!
5316
and i have just been staring at these dumb clouds for hours or whatever.
5316
i even saw my own dead body in a cloud!
5317
it's ok though, it already happened.
5317
i was sort of tricked into sleeping on my quest bed.
5317
and when i went to sleep, jack killed me.
5317
she must have known that would happen...
5317
vriska. do you know her?
5317
she is pretty cool, but just between you and me, she might be a little crazy!
5317
but, i don't think it's really like that...
5317
honestly i think dying was a necessary part of the process, and she just didn't tell me so i wouldn't get scared.
5317
well... i died on the quest bed and woke up here, as my dream self.
5317
and now i have all these sweet wind powers.
5317
which is how i am making this car fly!
5317
yeah!
5317
maybe, or he was just being some sort of aloof coolkid.
5317
yeah...
5317
hmm, i have no idea!
5317
maybe you shouldn't rule it out though?
5317
i mean, you did mention your dream self isn't COMPLETELY dead, remember?
5317
heheh.
5317
she was that bad, huh?
5317
ok, i will not pry.
5318
i know, right?
5318
/rolls eyes
5318
he is just this silly guy i met when i woke up here.
5318
he seemed to be curious about me and followed me around for a while.
5318
also, i noticed he was wearing my bedsheet.
5318
i don't know, there seems to be this whole cult full of people who worship my ghost sheets.
5318
i ran into a bunch of them in a salamander village, they are all completely ridiculous.
5318
so i guess he is a member of the cult?
5318
derp! they aren't idolizing ME, it's my dumb bedsheets they love!
5318
it's so stupid.
5318
OH!
5318
also, another thing about him...
5318
he has the queen's ring!
5318
i've tried! i asked him politely for it and everything.
5318
but he is very protective of it!
5318
actually, i think it's ok.
5318
i think he is supposed to keep it.
5318
yes. once i saw something in the clouds.
5318
it was hard to tell what was going on, but i saw him!
5318
im pretty sure it was the future, and he had the ring, and...
5318
and then the cloud stopped showing me.
5318
but i am pretty sure that some day...
5318
he will have to wear it!
5318
so i think i will just let him keep it.
5318
for some reason, i trust him.
5318
yeah, trust all around!
5318
how trustworthy do you even have to BE to CONFIDE in someone like that.
5318
anyway, i guess that's enough of that nonsense.
5318
i should keep looking for my dad!
5318
maybe if i fly around in this car with this guy beeping here, the noise will get his attention and he will find me.
5319
you did?
5319
oh! well that sure is convenient!
5319
where is he?
5319
oh wow...
5319
jade, what if they get married or something???
5319
oh god, if rose became my sister too, that would wreak HAVOC on karkat's shipping diagram!
5319
as leader of this team i submit that we cannot afford to let this happen!!!!!!!!!!
5319
everyone man your battle stations!!!
5319
we have a ship to sink! arm torpedoes!!!!!!
5319
KA-PCHOOOOOOOOOOOOO. target destroyed. B)
5319
heheh, i am just joking around, of course.
5319
:P
5319
yes, i agree.
5319
even if it would make it awkward for me to marry rose.
5319
but maybe that doesn't matter? these are kind of special circumstances.
5319
i wonder if my dad and her mom would mind us getting married...
5319
whoa, in love???
5319
oh jeez, yeah i guess you're right.
5319
um...
5319
er.
5319
argh!
5319
this line of questioning is making me flustered.
5319
all i know is, i was ordered by karkat to marry rose.
5319
i think we can both agree that it would be reckless to look at a crappy shipping diagram made by an alien, and ignore its message altogether.
5319
it's a thing of beauty, and it will save the human race.
5319
yes.
5319
btw, you will marry dave.
5319
100% TRUE REALITY.
5319
it's ok though, i will not press you on your feelings for him.
5319
i already know you are totally into the strider anyway.
5319
it's all in the diagram, jade.
5319
it's all in the diagram.
5319
that you do.
5319
ok but anyway, who cares about his terrible shitty drawings and meddlesome romantic schemes!
5319
how do i find my dad!
5319
bluh!!!
5319
yes, that's a good idea, i'll do that.
5319
thanks for the help, jade!
5319
i will talk to you later.
5320
karkat!
5320
what's up?
5320
know what?
5320
uh...
5320
oh no!
5320
are you in some sort of trouble?
5320
is it jack?
5320
karkat???
5320
what's going on?
5322
karkat!!!
5322
hey buddy, you were making me worried there...
5322
are you ok?
5322
errr...
5322
oh god, this is not right!
5322
you aren't supposed to hate me anymore, you're supposed to be kinda my friend, sorta!
5322
when is this?
5322
ok, duh! i know that.
5322
i mean, how many times have you talked to me before?
5322
AUGH!
5322
this isn't good, i need to talk to future you!
5322
because it sounds like you're in trouble.
5322
i think maybe you are running from jack?
5322
no, i know, but...
5322
*SIGN*
5322
ultimate riddle shit?
5322
no, i just want to talk to future you. :(
5366
oh, hey there, vriska.
5366
can this wait? i was about to check out this castle and see if my dad is here.
5366
oh...
5366
dang it!
5366
do you know where they are?
5366
argh, how much later??
5366
well...
5366
ok, i guess so.
5366
shrug.
5366
pshhh.
5366
i don't know if it is much of a major accomplishment, honestly.
5366
um... no?
5366
i guess i just miss my dad. i was hoping he would be here, but apparently i won't see him for another few hours or whatever?
5366
if that is what you see in the future, then i guess there's no fighting it. bluh.
5366
yeah, i know.
5366
i guess you just have to think of them the way you think of your lusus..ses? lusi?
5366
that...
5366
is too bad.
5366
no!!!
5366
why would i be mad at you, vriska?
5366
oh. right.
5366
i... actually almost forgot about that!
5366
why would you need to apologize though?
5366
i mean, i admit i was pretty confused about it at first, seeing my dead body in the cloud and all...
5366
but in the end, you did it to help me, didn't you?
5366
really, i should probably be thanking you!
5366
uh...
5366
are you there?
5366
heh. i really don't know what reason i would have to be angry!
5366
i mean, aside from the deception involved, but i kinda understand why you did that.
5366
and in any case, you did give me a choice.
5366
shruuuuuuuug!
5366
so...
5366
is that what you wanted to talk to me about?
5367
then what is it?
5367
you did?
5367
who was it? you mean like, a bad guy?
5367
oh yeah, karkat mentioned that he was in trouble, and then had to go.
5367
it made me a little worried! are you guys under attack or something?
5367
oh.
5367
well, then...
5367
who did you kill?
5367
why?
5367
well, did he attack you or something?
5367
uh...
5367
why did you have to?
5367
wow.
5367
you're right, vriska. that does not sound good.
5367
you don't?
5367
what about all of your friends?
5367
i bet karkat would listen.
5367
or what about terezi? she's pretty nice, isn't she?
5367
why not?
5367
well, how do you feel?
5367
oh...
5367
i guess i understand. i mean, i'm trying to, with the cultural difference and all.
5367
like, trolls are more violent and angry, right? kind of like klingons or something, which is an angry race of alien savages from a human tv show.
5367
oh, i know, that's not what i meant! but i am guessing you all have to act tough to make it in your world, and have a sense of honor about fighting, and like to beat people up and stuff, right?
5367
but i think that no matter what alien culture you are from, killing is still wrong!
5367
and it sounds like you do too.
5367
well, you could try. i am listening.
5367
i think if you feel bad, it just means you have a conscience. which is good, right?
5367
how was it like a test?
5367
ok.
5367
so...
5367
you killed other people, that you didn't care about?
5367
hm. how many?
5367
or... do i want to know...
5367
uhhhhhhhh.
5367
hopy shit...
5367
i guess that is why you didn't get along with her?
5367
i see.
5367
still, that is a LOT of killing. jesus...
5367
but then you finally killed a guy you liked, and...
5367
not so cool anymore?
5367
uh.
5367
...
5367
i guess i had no idea how different we really were.
5367
what i am hearing is seriously scaring the shit out of me!
5367
ok, well i appreciate the honesty.
5367
so... if killing isn't exactly wrong, then what is it?
5367
what do you mean by "what killing really means"?
5368
what does it mean?
5368
that sounds terrible!
5368
i would like to be culturally sensitive, but i wish it didn't have to be like that for you.
5368
i have started to really like you guys!
5368
:(
5368
yeah, that's true.
5368
hehe... yeah me too. :)
5368
what?
5368
uh...
5368
i don't really see how you guys killing each other would help you play the game better!
5368
dead?
5368
gosh...
5368
your team is so crazy!
5368
how?
5368
huh...
5368
yeah, i can see how that could be true.
5368
you probably mean that as an insult, but i think it is a nice compliment!
5368
but...
5368
i won't tell him you said it, heheheh.
5372
so... what about jack?
5372
are you still planning on killing him?
5372
that would be a constructive way to use your killer troll instincts, even by human standards.
5372
it is much better than killing friends.
5372
well, we have a plan to defeat him too, so there's that.
5372
yeah.
5372
so...
5372
will you go fight him then?
5372
for whatever it's worth coming from a human, feeling remorse doesn't make you weak!
5372
i bet you are still really strong.
5372
but then, i'm not sure if i actually want to encourage you to go off fighting him...
5372
because as strong as you probably are, it sounds like he is REALLY strong.
5372
and even though you killed tons of people, i think i would still be pretty sad if you died.
5372
so maybe you should just let us handle it? at least we won't fight him directly.
5372
well, maybe you don't?
5372
all of the luck sounds like an awful lot of luck to have.
5372
heh.
5372
what?
5373
yes.
5373
like...
5373
ancestors?
5373
wow, that is kinda neat.
5373
so, do you believe?
5373
all of them?
5373
hehe...
5373
how did you know she was the one?
5374
what was in the chest!
5375
that is a pretty exciting story!
5375
so then, your great great great grandnanna or such was some kind of troll pirate? uh, i mean, pir8?
5375
now that you mention that...
5375
it really sounds like our situations are not so different!
5375
i created our guardians in the lab too, along with the four of us.
5375
and when you think about it...
5375
i never even knew my nanna.
5375
she died before i was born. or, uh, before i created myself and sent baby me back in time, i mean.
5375
so really, she is my ancestor too! someone i am connected to genetically, but never knew.
5375
and even though i never knew her, she definitely helped me when i was growing up!
5375
i followed in her footsteps, and became an incredible prankster.
5375
i even had a book i learned a lot from too, the book was sort of a family tradition.
5375
it was written by an even older ancestor, my nanna's grandpa, who was only the most LEGENDARY PRANKSTER OF ALL TIME.
5375
so as you can see, we have both benefited greatly from ancestral wisdom.
5375
i think it is nice to see that when you take a closer look, we have a lot more in common than we first thought.
5375
what?
5375
heheheh, yep! also, her ashes were there too.
5375
yeah, it is pretty great, actually. i highly recommend being human.
5393
ok then, i guess i will get going.
5393
to keep looking for my dad!
5393
um...
5393
are you saying that i am still not supposed to find him yet?
5393
well, yeah.
5393
but what responsibility do you mean?
5393
ok.
5393
so you're saying i should go get the tumor now instead of putting it off?
5393
wait, i mean the tumor.
5393
wait...
5393
i mean The Tumor!
5393
yeah.
5393
which is what i was wondering about...
5393
how am i supposed to get it out?
5393
i guess go find a cave or something?
5393
what...
5393
uh, is that even possible?
5393
hehe, no.
5393
well, maybe some places, but most cars stay on the ground, because science fiction hasn't happened yet.
5393
yes, but...
5393
all i can do is make a lot of wind blow around!
5393
how is that going to help?
5393
alright, i will try.
5394
oh, man.
5394
i guess if there is nothing i can say to change your mind, and it's something you really have to do, then i understand.
5394
but, how about this...
5394
can this not be the last time we talk before you go?
5394
it would be nice to hear from you at least once before you leave to fight him.
5394
in my future, too! none of this messaging me in the past nonsense, before i even knew you.
5394
ok, great. i will hold you to that, vriska.
5394
ok, i will, later!
5764
hey, are you there?
5764
i did what you said...
5764
but i can't tell if it worked.
5764
hello?
5764
you didn't fly off to fight jack yet, did you?
5764
i hope not.
5764
anyway, all that stuff you said sounds fun to me, i have hells of the cage flicks in my library.
5764
i do not even care that you're an alien! you see, cage is the universal constant which unites us all.
5764
well...
5764
if you haven't flown away...
5764
i will look forward to your message in the future.
5764
it would be nice to talk, about...
5764
all this stuff that happened.
5764
anyway, bye.
5764
hey!
5764
what is???
5765
karkat!
5765
that was you?
5765
where is vriska?
5765
she what?
5765
what whole thing?
5765
you mean, what she wrote?
5765
why are you snooping around her computer!
5765
um...
5765
what are you talking about?
5765
well...
5765
yeah. why?
5765
talk about what?
5766
alright.
5766
like what?
5766
what plans?
5766
landed where?
5766
oh, obviously.
5766
no i'm not!
5766
i mean, yes, i am wearing some pretty nice pajamas.
5766
but i know lots of things, like about the tumor, which i have already recovered...
5766
wait, i mean <color=000000>the tumor</color>
5766
wait, fuck.
5766
i mean...
5766
oh screw it, you know, the big bomb, and some other stuff like that, i am totally in the loop.
5766
so i have to cause the scratch, huh?
5766
hi!
5767
aren't you going to ask me how my journey was?
5767
it was long! and windy. but a lot of fun.
5767
i really like flying, it's so much fun.
5767
you... haven't tried it?
5767
:\
5767
wait, is that the guy who vriska killed?
5767
haha, why?
5767
ok.
5767
but...
5767
is something wrong?
5767
a while ago you talked to me and it sounded like you were in danger, and it sounds like some people died, but you never told me what happened!
5767
then i got distracted by a lot of crazy stuff.
5767
oh.
5767
are you sure?
5767
but, i'm your friend. aren't i?
5767
well?
5767
who is gamzee?
5767
really? i thought terezi was your best friend.
5767
or wait, maybe she was your girlfriend, i forget...
5767
sorry, i don't mean to be nosy. i just want to know some things about your situation!
5767
i am concerned.
5767
heh, no.
5767
i think i know how you feel.
5767
so he killed some people... and then what?
5767
it's ok, you can tell me.
5767
hmm.
5767
ok, if you say so.
5767
oh!!!
5767
i can't believe i almost forgot, i've been dying to know since i left the battlefield...
5767
do you know if rose is ok?
5767
did it work???
5768
really??
5768
oh, wow.
5768
so, i guess...
5768
it would not have worked on my dad then?
5768
or rose's mom... :(
5768
er...
5768
well...
5768
she is a very pretty lady, but that seems like a really inappropriate thing to think about, karkat.
5768
i don't know!
5768
i am frankly pretty upset about finding them dead in the magic castle, and i guess i was wondering aloud if something could have been done.
5768
or at least maybe to talk about it, without angry tirades being involved.
5768
you are being a douche!!!
5768
wait, what am i saying, you are always a douche, hehe.
5768
heheheheh, your dad was a crab monster?
5768
yes.
5768
oh, great!
5768
how do you know it gets there?
5769
that's cool!
5769
it's nice to hear you are working together. i should pester jade and see what she's up too...
5769
oh...
5769
frog duties???
5769
wait, which one is kanaya again?
5769
wow. ok.
5769
aradia?
5769
:(
5769
...
5769
:(
5769
what!!!
5769
did she kiss him too? :O
5770
omg, karkat. it is like your shitty shipping grid is coming true before our very eyes.
5770
haha, remember when you made that ugly thing?
5771
but now they don't have dream selves left!
5771
who ever goes will be risking their life for good, won't they?
5771
this is unacceptable!
5771
couldn't i do it?
5771
i am apparently immortal, because of this god tier business, so the bomb probably would not kill me!
5771
hmm...
5771
maybe i could try to be not all that brave while i do it?
5771
yeah.
5771
i just don't want to lose anybody else is all.
5771
oh, yeah.
5771
she mentioned something about that. she said she prototyped her dream self?? what happened with that?
5771
why?
5771
...
5771
wow.
5771
/raises eyebrows
5771
ok, i am putting them back down as not suggestively as possible.
5771
what is what this is?
5771
was...
5771
was that another weird erotic slip of the tongue?
5771
ok, well,
5771
what i am getting from this, aside from the possibility that jade may or may not have kissed dog jade at some point, is that neither of them will be able to help with the bomb plan.
5771
aren't those the really tough to kill guys?
5771
did she kill him?
5771
haha.
5771
word for what?
5771
ok, well what about this.
5771
since she is mortal, and i am not (sort of), and i don't need to do the scratch for a while, can i go help her?
5771
maybe she could use some protection? maybe that is what dave was just trying to do, when he temporarily died.
5771
remember, jack is still on the loose! he has killed rose and dave once, and me twice.
5771
sorry. :(
5771
really?
5771
d'aw, that's actually kinda cute.
5771
i don't think he would be fooled. dogs have pretty good senses of smell.
5772
what is your plan?
5772
rendezvous with who?
5772
jade knows so many things lately, what is even her deal?
5772
come with you where? who are they?
5772
through the lawn ring?
5772
oh!!
5772
so then, this is how we're supposed to meet. that is kind of exciting.
5772
so, i guess you are not worried about it turning into a huge sloppy makeout fest anymore...
5772
huh?
5772
won't there be other players in the new session?
5772
like, alternate universe versions of ourselves or such?
5772
yeah... it's just kind of a weird thought.
5772
but i guess it's sort of comforting too.
5772
if rose or dave have to go off and die, at least i get to see them again, in a way.
5772
even if i will only be alternate universe john to them.
5772
maybe my dad will be alive in that session too!!!
5772
ok. i'll do my best.
5772
what should i do right now?
5772
oh, man.
5772
our "first" conversation ever? i can't wait.
5772
thanks karkat!
5781
auuugh!
5782
excuse me, alien time troll, but i am TRYING to wrap a present.
5782
really, you all have the worst timing.
5782
nope, not going to ask how you know my name, or what i'm sending, don't care.
5782
and one of these ugly garments is for me, also, it's not ugly, it's awesome.
5782
uh oh, my mouse is hovering dangerously close to the block button!
5782
it always does that when i talk to trolls, it is the dangdest thing.
5782
oh sweet, that has been on my wish list, ranking just below a mint condition little monsters poster, starring hollywood superstar, howie mandel.
5782
can i expect it to arrive on my next birthday??
5782
the mandel poster, or immortality?
5782
i see, here is where all the sick trolling begins!
5782
you can keep your present, i am not interested.
5782
sigh...
5782
the other troll i just talked to was way better, if a tad grumpy, at least she was down with talking about cool movies, sort of.
5782
that's nice. now scram, troll!
5782
ok, you got me!
5782
my feathers are all ruffled, and i can no longer tell my ass apart from a big orange earth vegetable!
5782
now can you leave me alone?
5782
that is basically the worst pickup line i have ever heard.
5782
blurp durp bluh, more plausible alien sounding things.
5782
weren't you leaving?
5782
ok then...
5782
oh.
5782
why?
5782
it isn't?
5783
ok.
5783
is this conversation over now? can i keep packing my present?
5783
well,
5783
i was going to block you. but then...
5783
i didn't for some reason.
5783
i guess i am feeling something like deja vu... maybe.
5783
i still don't think i believe you, though.
5783
i don't even know who you are!!!
5783
what did you ask for?
5783
was this after you killed me, and gave me immortality?
5783
about what?
5783
you mean, hanging out?
5783
oh god, this is so ridiculous. you are just a crazy troll on the internet, and i need to get back to packing up this present for my friend! we are not going to hang out, i'm sorry.
5783
what will that accomplish?
5805
so.
5805
it seems that you are, in fact, an alien. with horns and everything.
5805
huh.
5805
i don't know. aliens usually have big spooky eyes, don't they?
5805
haha, you mean mac and me? yeah, even i can admit that movie was indefensible.
5805
i can accept that you are an alien, but come on. meeting an alien who is also a GHOST in my front yard is a bit much to believe.
5805
it is almost too awesome.
5805
hmm...
5805
nope. sounds cool though.
5805
yeah, i thought you looked pretty cold out here.
5805
so i brought you this jacket.
5806
hey, your clothes switched suddenly.
5806
was that some kind of alien wardrobe warpifying technology?
5806
such as a warpdrobe, if you will?
5806
you look pretty cool in more normal clothes. not that your space boots and pixie outfit weren't neat.
5806
um, i don't know about that, really.
5806
it just seemed like the nice thing to do.
5806
is...
5806
is this a date?
5806
ok, that's probably for the best.
5806
i would probably be pretty nervous on a date with a normal girl, let alone on a...
5806
DATE WITH AN ALIEN SPACE GHOST!!!
5806
heheheheheheh.
5806
well...
5806
since i am presuming you are new to the planet...
5806
i could show you around the place.
5807
this is my green slime ghost pogo ride, in all its glory.
5807
in my childhood, it was hours of fun, and hundreds of painful injuries.
5807
nope.
5807
um.
5807
not... really?
5807
humans just don't really have much use for slime, i guess.
5807
honestly, i can't think of a single practical use for slime, other than to be gross!
5807
anyway, this thing is kind of a death trap, and i haven't ridden it for years.
5807
i think my dad had it installed as one of his ridiculous ways of making a man out of me.
5807
yeah.
5807
parents, right? haha.
5807
anyway, that's my back yard. pretty damn boring, sorry.
5807
i would show you inside, but i don't think my dad would take too kindly to bringing an alien inside.
5807
or, just yet. i would need to brace him for it.
5807
i could show you around my neighborhood, if you want.
5808
these are my neighbors, who live in a lot of same looking houses as mine.
5808
i never see them. i think they're all really busy people with a lot of serious business to attend to.
5808
hey, look.
5808
the snow is melted over here.
5808
it's really warm suddenly. weird.
5808
no, this is pretty unusual december weather.
5808
guess i'll take my coat off.
5808
i can take yours back, if you want.
5809
there is not really much to see in this town...
5809
but there are these lakes.
5809
this lake here did not used to be a lake. a long time ago, before i was born, there was a factory here.
5809
my dad says there was a huge explosion. he was walking by with my nanna when he saw it.
5809
then a little later, my nanna died. my dad never told me how, except that it involved a big joke book.
5809
i never knew her, which is too bad. she sounded nice.
5809
you did?
5809
ok!
5809
wow, really?
5809
hmm.
5809
that all sounds incredible if true, but i don't have even the foggiest memory of that happening!
5809
the tour... of earth?
5810
what's happening?
5810
where?
5811
how is this happening?
5811
is this through the advanced alien technologies?
5811
like holograms, or teleportations?
5811
where are we?
5811
oh, cool.
5811
and what's that, over there?
5812
it's a castle!!!
5812
you built it?
5812
oh gosh.
5812
so rad.
5812
i think i know what you mean.
5812
i feel like a long time ago, i might have given my dad the impression i really liked clowns?
5812
and now there are clowns everywhere, his stupid collection just keeps growing and growing, and it drives me CRAZY.
5812
heheh.
5813
8O
5814
:(
5815
holy shit, look at these glittering space riches!
5815
What's with the broken eight balls?
5816
haha, more eight balls!!!
5816
you sure do like to smash them.
5816
what are you wearing?
5816
is that a rocket car stuck in the web over there?
5816
what's that about?
5816
there's something really familiar about that rocket...
5817
what's happening?
5817
are we back on earth?
5817
it's my house again. why are we here?
5817
i was having fun seeing your planet!
5818
this is my dad's room.
5818
but...
5818
i have never been inside of it.
5818
so why do i recognize it?
5818
i think...
5818
there were some birthday presents for me in here.
5818
but i can't recall which birthday that was.
5818
but i'm 12!
5819
oh yeah.
5819
i remember this.
5819
there were these imps all over my house, acting all rambunctious.
5819
but... why?
5819
it's all so hazy.
5819
where is my dad?
5819
no.
5819
sorry.
5823
hey, look!
5823
that's my dad.
5823
what's he doing here?
5824
i've missed the heck out of him.
5824
though i'm not sure why. he should be safe at home right now.
5824
i guess i must have lost track of him. but i don't remember how.
5824
all i know is i have this feeling like i should run over and give him a hug.
5824
are you a psychic alien? like the one who jodie foster met in contact, and assumed the form of her dead father to talk to her?
5824
i see. so it is not me who is jodie foster. it's more like you are jodie, because nobody believed her when she came home and had amazing tales to tell.
5824
except matthew mcconaughey.
5824
but it's ok. i will be your matt mcconaughey.
5824
i guess i always did, sort of.
5824
i think i've been in denial about what's happening here.
5824
so if this isn't my dad, then where is he?
5824
no. not at all.
5824
i am remembering a bunch of things, but not that.
5824
no.
5824
i only remember when you contacted me and said you'd kill me a little earlier.
5824
but that was months ago.
5824
i do remember talking to some other trolls like you.
5824
and playing this game. it was on my 13th birthday. i was really looking forward to playing it, but it was late in the mail.
5824
i got some presents from my dad. like this big weird clown doll that i didn't like much.
5824
and some fruit gushers...
5824
oh yeah! i also realized gushers were made by betty crocker. that freaked me the fuck out!
5824
did YOU realize betty crocker makes gushers???
5824
well she does. her villainy knows no bounds.
5824
oh.
5824
he also gave me this suit, which i remember wearing for a while.
5824
but it didn't look quite like this.
5824
it had a black tie, and no ghost, so i improved it.
5824
actually...
5824
i remember dying in a suit.
5824
but
5824
this was not the suit i was wearing when i died.
5825
this was.
5849
i remember now.
5849
i was tricked by a troll into flying up to the last gate, using this rocket pack.
5849
she said i could take a shortcut and go kill my denizen while he was sleeping.
5849
it...
5849
did not quite work out that way.
5849
i don't know. she didn't tell me her name.
5849
she was a blind troll. she made me this incredibly shitty map for me to follow!
5849
she tricked you too?
5849
wow. that's pretty cold blooded!
5849
why not?
5849
hmm...
5849
so i guess you never got around to giving me immortality like you said? or killing me, for that matter.
5849
sounds like the blind troll beat you to it.
5849
explain what?
5849
so...
5849
now it is a date?
5849
nope.
5849
no, i get that.
5849
if i had decided not to take the shortcut, i would have lived. and then you would have talked to me a lot?
5849
well, i might not have figured that out, if not for...
5849
some things that just happened.
5849
sorry... not sure what to tell you!
5849
well, you did just show me around your planet. which was really cool!
5849
... there's compromising stuff?
5849
i guess not.
5849
but who says we can't get to know each other again?
5849
no way! not if you wouldn't.
5849
you said the name of the blind troll who killed us, but you have not told me yours yet.
5849
no.
5849
nice to meet you, vriska.
5849
i am john! even though you know that.
5849
so now what do we do? aside from be dead for probably ever.
5850
well, like i said, i flew up to the last gate. like this.
5850
oh, nice boots!
5851
it brought me inside the palace.
5851
it was huge, and it took a long time to explore. it was eerily empty too.
5851
i had that weird feeling of getting to a place in a video game you are not supposed to be yet, because you don't have the right powerups and such.
5851
you know what i mean?
5851
oh, ok.
5851
so, i started getting crazy nervous the longer i was down here, and i was starting to wonder if my silly iron pogo hammer would even do any damage against the monster.
5851
what?
5851
excuse me, it is called the wrinkle fucker, and it is totally amazing.
5851
that's so absurd, like anything like that would ever even happen!!!
5852
i found it very deep in the palace dungeon. i was wandering for hours, following a horrible sound through the pipes.
5852
i could tell typheus was really close, because it was very loud here. it could only be the sound of him sleeping.
5852
i was so tempted to play it, but i didn't dare risk waking him up!
5852
pretty much by then i was sweating bullets at the thought of confronting him.
5852
yeah...
5852
i guess if i ever see her, i should thank her too.
5852
because this was important.
5852
well, yes. but not just that.
5852
the whole ruse was important!
5852
if i didn't make the decision to go, then dave would not be able to go back in time and fix things.
5852
in fact, if i didn't die here in this palace, we never would have been born in the first place!
5852
this way...
5853
nooope.
5853
he was wide awake when i found him. i practically crapped my pants!
5853
what was your denizen like?
5853
what do you mean, tricky?
5853
did she talk to you?
5853
so, is that what you all did?
5853
kill your denizens as fast as possible, without listening to them?
5853
yes, so i've heard.
5853
maybe he just talked to his denizen?
5853
i dunno. you might be surprised!
5853
yes!
5853
typheus may not be pretty to look at...
5853
but he is not a bad guy at all!
6195
where are we?
6196
oh, ok.
6196
then...
6196
we escaped the scratch?
6196
like, we still exist and everything?
6196
ok, just making sure.
6196
i still felt pretty existy, but you never know.
6197
i'm still kinda confused though.
6197
i mean, we crashed through that giant window you magically made with witch powers to escape the scratch, so we can keep existing, right?
6197
i see.
6197
did you at least make it huge with witch powers?
6197
so i guess that's what witch powers do, is make things huge?
6197
right, like you did with all those planets.
6197
man, spacey witch powers sound a lot more versatile than my powers, frankly.
6197
not that i'm complaining, because wind powers are still awesome.
6197
but anyway, that is neither here nor there!
6197
what i'm wondering is, once we crashed through that window, weren't we supposed to like...
6197
enter a new game session? the reset one?
6197
and meet up with karkat, and vriska, and all the trolls, and i guess maybe also a bunch of dead trolls too??? like troll ghosts or such.
6197
and what about your grandson? wasn't he going to be there, from the future or something? and then he would send liv tyler to me, or actually to you i guess, into the past somehow?
6197
wow...
6197
hey, i wonder what the fuck ever happened to liv anyway?
6197
last i saw her, i sent her off to give the tumor to rose and dave...
6197
oh god, rose and dave!!! where are they now? did one of them do the suicide mission thing? and what about the other? did they get scratch'd???
6197
:(
6197
so, they blew up the sun, and now they're dead?
6197
oh man, that's great!
6197
i mean, i'm not sure how not blowing up the sun qualifies as a successful mission, since that was kind of the whole idea, but at this point i don't really care. i'm just happy to hear they're ok.
6197
how do you know they're ok? or any of this stuff, really?
6197
ok, that sounds awesome.
6197
and that was part of the plan i guess i understood, but...
6197
where is this new session?
6197
all i see here is a bunch of giant windows, and a lot of warp speed whooshy nonsense.
6198
you mean that one way over there?
6198
ok...
6198
so is this place like that yellow lawn ring thing karkat was talking about?
6198
how is this a yellow yard?
6198
that's a stupid name for this place!
6198
thats not a yard.
6198
yards are like these flat wide patches of grass, surrounded by fences and stuff.
6198
if anything, it's more like a road.
6198
sure, why not!
6198
let's all go see a big pompous wizard to solve all of our problems.
6198
i bet rose would get a kick out of that.
6198
oh yeah.
6198
and another thing...
6199
what...
6199
the fuck...
6199
is that?
6202
wait, what just happened?
6202
it got darker, and greener...
6202
this place is weird. when are we gonna bust through the other window, anyway?
6202
i'm kind of antsy to get on with our adventure and meet up with everybody!
6202
what is it?
6203
i see.
6203
since we are going so fast, it should be pretty soon, right?
6203
like a few more minutes?
6203
ugh.
6203
how long?
6204
what!!!
6204
that is an absolutely preposterous amount of time.
6204
are you sure you can't make it go any faster?
6204
i mean, not to sound too demanding, but...
6204
didn't you say you can teleport stuff?
6204
why not teleport us there?
6204
oh. well that sucks.
6204
why not?
6204
uh, ok.
6204
that sounds...
6204
big.
6204
i see.
6204
it didn't really occur to me this was all so elaborate.
6204
like, if the green sun is at the center of a bunch of universes, like a huge solar system...
6204
doesn't that mean it was sort of important?
6204
maybe trying to blow it up wasn't such a great idea.
6204
oh man, a prank??
6204
who pranked us?
6204
oh. well that was quite a ruse then. that son of a bitch!
6204
their true mission?
6204
what was that?
6204
...
6236
oh man, rose and dave have sweet god tier pajamas like us! that's so awesome.
6236
haha, dave looks like kind of a doofus with that snug little hood.
6236
that's true.
6236
i still think i prefer my outfit though.
6236
look at all those trolls...
6236
there are so many trolls. the idea of meeting them all is kind of overwhelming.
6236
i wonder which one is which?
6236
i think that must have been karkat there. and that was probably his clown asshole friend he mentioned, too.
6236
and that was definitely terezi, with the fancy glasses.
6236
not sure about the others... i wonder if vriska was there?
6236
it's nice to see rose looks better.
6236
last time i saw her, she looked really grim.
6236
and also, dark.
6236
i was trying to talk to her, but she sounded like a babbling monster, so i couldn't understand her.
6236
it was really frustrating, and all of my nervous rambling probably made me sound like an idiot.
6236
and then when i woke up later, she was dead.
6236
did you know...
6236
that i had to kiss her to make her come back to life?
6236
yes, it's true.
6236
it's kind of weird kissing a dead body, but i didn't mind.
6236
how did you feel about it when you kissed dave when he died?
6236
karkat told me.
6236
do you think that all of our unbridled corpse smooching means karkat's silly shipping prophecy will come true?
6236
i mean, the guy is really angry, and says fuck like in practically every sentence.
6236
but he does weirdly seem to know what he's talking about when it comes to romance.
6236
man.
6236
i don't know.
6236
do you?
6236
hmm, indeed.
6236
yeah.
6236
there's a lot i want to tell them about.
6236
and a lot i want to ask them.
6236
really?
6237
whoa!
6237
well, heck, why don't we do that then?
6237
it would probably be more fun with them than being on this golden battleship by ourselves.
6237
oh yeah.
6237
dammit!
6237
but i wouldn't want to leave you here all alone for three years.
6237
that would suck!
6238
:O
6238
that's right.
6238
that makes it seem not so boring i guess.
6238
but still...
6238
i would feel really bad leaving you here, even if you do have a million salamanders and chess guys to keep you company.
6238
you are my friend and also my sorta-sister, and we just met for the first time ever a few minutes ago...
6238
i'm not going to be like, welp! see ya in three years jade!
6238
yeah.
6238
now that you mention it, i'm pretty beat.
6238
also... starving!!!
6238
heheh.
6238
i sure hope there are things to eat on those planets.
6238
there were a lot of weird glowing mushrooms on lowas. i dunno about those.
6238
i seem to remember a bunch of farms on the battlefield...
6238
yeah, probably.
6238
pff, hell, we could just raid all of our fridges and alchemize some tasty grub!
6238
ok, cool.
6238
but it would still be nice to say hi to everybody before they leave.
6238
just to let them know how we're doing.
6238
like, one of the last things rose saw before she died was me dying...
6238
i wonder if she knows i'm ok?
6238
yeah, probably.
6238
then maybe i'll just hop over real fast, and give karkat a fist bump, and give dave a hard time about his hella tight little hood, and then hop back?
6238
aw man, really??
6238
that's stupid.
6238
what is with all these rules!
6238
isn't that a contradiction though?
6238
if there are limits to your powers, you can't exactly be OMNIpotent, can you?
6238
more like...
6238
semipotent.
6238
demidogs.
6238
heh...
6238
can you not control the woofs?
6238
so, the dog ears...
6238
is that a permanent thing now, or what?
6238
i like them.
6238
you are like a furry now, but not really the weird kind that people on the internet like to have sex with in their imagination.
6239
hey, can i at least send a message through?
6239
like a note or something?
6239
oh snap! ok, gotta think, quick...
6239
what do i write on?
6239
maybe the back of a movie poster or something?
6239
i don't think i have one captchalogued though...
6239
and now that i think about it, most of them were ruined by imps. :(
6240
yes, that's perfect!!!
6240
everyone will love it, especially probably dave.
6240
i think i need something to fold it up and put it in though.
6240
i don't want to just like crumple it up and chuck it in there like some garbage...
6241
i could stick it in a book i guess.
6241
but i kind of don't want to part with any great reading material, especially since we're going on a long trip.
6241
ok, ok, um...
6242
oh, yeah. i guess that'll be fine.
6242
now, uhhh, what to write...
6242
ok, will do.
6242
huh?
6243
oh fuck, it's dave sprite!!!
6243
i forgot about him.
6243
how've you been, buddy?
6244
ok, i think this is a pretty good letter.
6244
oh HELL no.
6244
augh you bastard!
6245
wait a minute!
6245
i forgot, trolls hate cleaning products for some alien reason! shit, that's going to make everyone so uncomfortable.
6245
oh well, there it goes. too late i guess.
6629
no way! this game rules.
6629
i just never gave it much playing time before because...
6629
well, i guess i always had better things to do.
6629
years ago i found it in a store on the bargain rack.
6629
it was only a dollar! isn't that awesome?
6630
yesss. you won't be disappointed.
6630
um, i don't know.
6630
i only showed it to a few people, but i guess hundreds are playing it now?
6630
nobody is very good at it though.
6630
i keep trying to tell the salamanders and chess guys not to cross the streams, but they keep crossing the streams!
6630
just between you and me, i think a lot of them aren't very bright.
6630
jade, please.
6630
it is just something you can't do when you're a ghost buster, because it spells big trouble. everyone knows that.
6631
you should hurry up and make a character already, so we can get started.
6631
just any old ghost buster! as long as he looks awesome and like he means business.
6631
i will begin organizing our squad.
6631
well, first we need buy an old abandoned fire station to use as a headquarters.
6631
luckily half the city is composed of abandoned fire stations that are for sale...
6631
this game is actually really stupid in a lot of ways, now that i think about it.
6631
hey, shut up!
6631
i take it back, it's great in every way.
6631
ok, now i have to find us a mission.
6631
got to hire a sassy secretary...
6631
just have to peruse this extensive palette of sarcastic red headed ladies...
6631
ok, here is a good one.
6631
then we wait for a phone call. this can take anywhere from ten seconds to several hours.
6631
but that's fine!
6631
there's lots to do in the station to kill time.
6631
like talk to slimer, and...
6631
get slimed by slimer.
6631
ok, i guess that's pretty much all there is to do.
6631
the fire pole is strictly decorative.
6631
are you almost finished making your character?
6632
jade.
6632
that is absolutely the shittiest ghost buster i have ever seen.
6632
yes.
6632
it is so yes way.
6632
jade, i thought you were going to take this game seriously.
6632
that is not a serious ghost buster. no ghost could possibly fear that thing.
6632
it is not possible, ghosts are known to be cruel and mischievous.
6632
they will not want to befriend your fox man, they will only want to cover him in slime and then fly away.
6632
i really think you should consider redesigning him.
6632
ok, well, if you want to turn our squad into a fucking joke, then that's your business.
6632
argh!
6632
but seriously, those head swap options are for such noobs, i feel it's only fair to warn you.
6632
ok, fine.
6632
you get a pass, but only because you yourself are a furry.
6632
what?
6632
is someone messaging you through the game?
6632
who is it?
6632
dammit, jade...
6632
oh.
6632
don't tell him any of our strategies. he is the enemy!
6632
um...
6632
ok, first, tell him we have strategies. then, don't tell him them.
6632
oh god.
6632
what is it now?
6632
meh, he's alright i guess.
6632
i give most of his jokes a passing grade. sometimes as high as a solid b+!
6632
that's fine, he and i keep no secrets.
6632
oh, like him taking credit for my existence isn't so old by now!
6632
hey, jade...
6632
why do you still call him davesprite?
6632
i just call him dave.
6632
isn't that easier? i mean, he IS dave after all... right?
6632
pshh, he is so not different.
6632
dude is just a magical orange dave with wings! and also says caw sometimes.
6633
like what?
6633
he still raps sometimes.
6633
i just thought i would mention that.
6633
trust me, it hasn't.
6633
well, weren't you a sprite before?
6633
how different did you feel then?
6633
oh, right.
6633
so...
6633
half of you was a sprite.
6633
do you remember what it was like being jade sprite?
6633
oh really?
6633
which ones?
6633
hmm.
6633
i have to admit, i am a little disappointed in the dream bubble thing.
6633
by the way you were describing it, i really thought we would dream about them on this trip more often!
6633
i dunno.
6633
man...
6633
that was weeks ago, i think.
6633
and then, when i do dream about them, it's just kind of weird.
6633
either i'm alone in my own memory, talking to figments of my imagination...
6633
or i dream about someone we know. like a troll we have talked to, and i get excited.
6633
but then it turns out they don't know who i am! it's like a version of them that died before they ever even knew us, and it's just kind of awkward.
6633
and i still haven't seen dave or rose AT ALL.
6634
have you?
6634
yeah.
6634
i'm starting to think it's not going to happen. i wonder if we're just not sleeping at the same times?
6634
heh. that's true.
6634
do you think the afterlife is just fucking with us, jade?
6634
that is so infuriating!
6634
yeah.
6634
oh well.
6634
i guess it's only two more years.
6635
what do you think they will be like by then?
6635
do you think karkat will have driven them all insane?
6635
or maybe they will all be better friends with each other than they are with us.
6635
i don't know. there ARE some pretty charming salamanders on this ship.
6635
but you know what i mean. things have a way of changing.
6635
like, have you thought at all about what it's going to be like when you see dave again?
6635
i mean, after the way things are going with you and dave sprite?
6635
jade, please.
6635
*sigh*
6635
you are not fooling anyone with your coy shenanigans.
6635
nothing!! do you really think he would talk about any of that with me?
6635
there are just some obvious conclusions a guy is going to make about stuff.
6635
hm.
6635
alright, fair enough.
6635
huh?
6635
ah HA! so you HAVE thought about it!
6635
yes. yes i did.
6635
i have no idea. we would probably never find out one way or the other, regardless.
6635
what about me even?
6636
yes.
6636
what is your point!
6636
oh man.
6636
jade, listen.
6636
at this point i could not give less of a rat's ass about romancey stuff!
6636
i would rather just play some games, and chill out for several years on this magical flying boat. is that too much to ask?
6636
when i catch up with our buddies, i'm sure i will give rose a nice, FRIENDLY hug.
6636
whereas i will offer dave a tender bro embrace, and shove karkat down a flight of friendship stairs.
6636
but that is IT.
6636
it's all very complicated and bothersome, jade.
6636
you know. matters of the heart.
6636
ok, you may laugh at my choice of words, but it is true.
6636
it's really befuddling and distracting when you are on a major quest to make universes out of frogs. who even needs it?
6636
like...
6636
you remember that troll girl who was sort of into me?
6636
well, ok.
6636
that seemed like a pretty big deal at the time!
6636
it really seemed like she liked me, but also, she was *probably* insane?
6636
like, i mean, in a trollish, murderous kind of way.
6636
but craziness notwithstanding, i didn't really know what to think.
6636
i guess i thought she was cool at the time. i was honestly kind of flummoxed about it.
6636
but the point is, when all was said and done, that was just some stuff that happened over one day, which was a whole year ago already.
6636
i barely even remember what we talked about. by the time we meet up, she probably won't give a shit about me at all.
6636
which, let's face it, is probably for the best.
6636
i think we make things more meaningful in our head when they're happening than they really are. like realistically? there were probably a lot of things that went on that day that didn't mean that much.
6636
like remember how you said you thought karkat was getting this silly angry crush on you?
6636
yeah.
6636
i mean, do you really think after three years he is still going to have the rage hots for you?
6636
i don't think even he is that crazy.
6636
anyway, my point is, who even cares about all that?
6636
romance and dating are dumb and boring. we are legendary heroes, and we have bigger fish to fry. like that smug fatass over there on the horizon.
6636
he sure looks pleased with himself. just look at him, he thinks he is the undisputed king of that mountain or something.
6636
follow me so we can seize the high ground against this hideous ocean dwelling marshmallow man, and steal all of his treasure.
6637
jaspers, holy shit, another cake?
6637
but there are still all these others we haven't touched.
6637
nanna is really baking up a storm today.
6637
jaspers, whoa, what are you doing?
6637
jaspers, no!!!
6637
it's fine if you want to sing me the birthday song, but for the love of god, don't MEOW it!!!!!
6637
you're going to rile her up!
6637
no jade, come on, PLEASE settle down.
6637
oh my god.
6638
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
6652
hi.
6652
which troll are you?
6652
uh...
6652
for a whale?
6652
what does that mean?
6652
oh, right.
6652
i thought it sounded kind of... fishy!
6652
you must be the sea troll, i heard about you.
6652
but i'm pretty sure we never talked.
6652
have you by any chance seen vriska around? or karkat?
6653
um... your troll friends?
6653
yes.
6653
oh no...
6653
why would you do that!
6653
uh. what?
6653
i'm not sure what clamscray means either. you mean go away?
6653
what?
6654
yes. well, it's a dream bubble.
6654
so yeah, you are probably a ghost.
6654
you're excited to be dead?
6654
why?
6655
what plan?
6655
i dunno.
6655
just curious about your spooky ghost plan is all.
6655
no, we're humans.
6655
by which i mean aliens, i guess.
6655
i know, right? that's what i think sometimes.
6655
it's strange combination of sci-fi things. like alien stuff is all about science, right? at least it is in movies. aliens LOVE science. but then ghosts have nothing to do with science, they belong to the supernatural realms, which have more to do with religion i guess? or about a lot of hocus pocus and superstition, maybe even magic. science rarely enters the equation, unless it's something awesome like ghost busters, which makes ghosts and stuff ALL ABOUT science, even though the ghost science is obviously a bunch of total nonsense. i guess contact mixes aliens and ghosts because jodie foster saw her ghost dad in outer space? but then, that was probably just a science projection from an alien, to make her feel less sad about her dead dad, and not a real ghost or anything. i guess the lesson is that science and aliens teach us that ghosts and religion are fake? although, it turns out ghosts and aliens are actually real, so maybe science and religion have been lying to us all along. *shrug*
6655
um.
6655
yeah, sorry.
6655
what?
6655
ha, no, i don't even know her.
6655
i kinda thought you knew who she was?
6655
huh?
6655
yeah, a little...
6657
no!!!
6657
snoozing mystery girl, look out!!!
7183
jade...
7185
i think i just realized something.
7187
THIS MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!!!
7188
yeah, i know.
7188
i mean... i thought i did.
7188
it's been kind of a long time since i last saw it. i really remember it being a lot better than this!
7188
but now everything just seems so cheesy and stupid.
7188
i don't know. i'm trying to like it. i WANT to like it.
7188
i want to feel the same magic that was there all the other times i watched it.
7188
but i can't, because...
7188
it's just...
7188
not...
7188
good. :(
7188
but i DID take it seriously!!!
7188
i guess maybe that's kind of the point.
7188
i always thought all this hokey bullshit was legitimately awesome and compelling.
7188
what was i even thinking!
7188
well, maybe later i'll be able to rekindle some nostalgic feelings about it.
7188
but right now, i just feel like a dope for talking this up so hard.
7188
it's just non stop terrible action movie cliches!
7189
look.
7189
i love nic cage. he is basically my hero, ok?
7189
but i'm kind of just realizing now that he is EMBARRASSINGLY BAD in this movie!
7189
he is just doing this corny parody of a southern guy who is down on his luck, and acts "charming" with his goofy accent and stuff.
7189
some things i used to think were so badass are just coming off as ridiculous now.
7189
can you believe that one time we were watching this movie, when he said "put the bunny back in the box" i actually high fived my dad?
7189
this time that line just made me roll my eyes.
7189
there's so much crappy dialogue!
7189
"cyrus, this is your barbecue, and it tastes good..." arrgh!
7189
jade, please. it was a cheesy line, don't be so naive.
7189
ok, i'm sorry. i guess in fairness to you, you have only just begun to climb the steep learning curve of this vexing and hypnotic film.
7189
but i am no longer bound by its spell, jade.
7189
i am fine. this MOVIE is what's crappy these days.
7190
who even cares what we missed.
7190
just cameron stupid poe in his idiot wife beater babbling some more southern home spun heroic nonsense.
7190
heart of gold my ass!!!!!
7190
everything dave ever said about this movie was right! i can't believe i used to think he was just trolling me.
7190
the stupid junkyard scene where cyrus makes a little model out of rocks and stuff, just so he could tell the criminals to surround some army guys and shoot them... that was pointless!
7190
and all this heavy handed scoring. oh my god. the music makes every little thing into such a federal issue!
7190
like... oh man, SOME MINOR CHARACTERS BEING INTRODUCED IN SLOW MOTION! dun-dun dun-dun DUN DUN DUN!!!
7190
there. now you officially know they are all badasses.
7190
also, i somehow didn't even remember dave chappelle being in this movie. he was pointless too.
7190
and you know the malloy guy, the dick head cop who we're supposed to hate, because of how he gives john cusack a hard time and makes asshole decisions with a helicopter?
7190
well screw that! he wasn't so bad. so what if he was a little grumpy? he was just trying to do his job. he had one of the best lines in the movie actually, which was another thing we were supposed to hate him for.
7190
what was it? about how cusack was probably out saving a tree and recycling his sandals or some shit? HAHAHA! now that i think about it, i fucking LOVE malloy.
7190
i'm going to rewind it to watch that scene again...
7190
oh, and we're supposed to be like "YEAH" when cusack wrecks malloy's awesome sports car.
7190
but that was a nice car! john cusack shouldn't have ruined it like that for laughs.
7190
i know *I* wasn't laughing, were you?
7190
john cusack was such a terrible character in this movie now that i think about it. i don't really get what he added to it?
7190
he was like the second hero... but dorkier? what did he even really do? he scampered around the junkyard for a while goofing off, and then when it was his time to shine...
7190
HE DEMONSTRATED HIS MASTERY OVER HEAVY MACHINERY! wow, he can operate a crane! i am thrilled by the exploits of this pedantic weenie.
7190
i guess he's actually like cage's estranged sidekick? almost like the robin that batman never realized he had.
7190
now that i think about it, this movie was always an oddly poignant tale of bromance between cage and cusack. just two bros separated by destiny, waiting to be united.
7190
when they finally come together to kick some ass, it is arguably more moving than when he reunites with his wife and daughter!
7190
i wonder if i'll think that scene sucks now too? it used to move me to tears, but now i'll probably think it's so lame, i'm almost afraid to watch it. maybe i should try to leave at least SOME memories untainted.
7190
yeah right! crazy like a fOWWW!
7190
oh...
7190
i guess there was a stray feather clinging to my pajamas and it just poked me in the ass.
7191
god damn dave sprite.
7191
that guy molts like it's going out of style.
7191
where is he anyway?
7191
i specifically told dave sprite several times when my party would start, because i knew he would do this.
7191
he's already missed half the movie!
7191
um... because that's his name?
7191
dave sprite.
7191
what ever.
7191
i can't believe he's standing me up on my birthday.
7191
maybe he doesn't want to hang out with jaspers?
7191
jaspers, i hope you're not going to start chasing him around again when he gets here.
7191
dude, shut up.
7192
aw, man. really?
7192
i knew we shouldn't have invited both him and jaspers.
7192
that's just party planning BASICS.
7192
oh.
7192
then why?
7192
what!!!
7193
when did that happen?
7193
no. no way.
7193
i cannot accept this!
7193
you and dave sprite were like the glue holding everything together on this miserable road trip!
7193
yes, jade.
7193
you were our rock.
7193
come on, jade.
7193
you and dave sprite were like... an INSTITUTION on this stupid golden battleship.
7193
why did he break up with you?!
7193
stuff??
7193
what stuff.
7193
jade, we are all going through stuff. you don't see me flying off the handle and breaking up with MY girlfriend.
7193
that is not the point.
7193
the point is that dave sprite is a douche.
7193
no, he's an orange feathery douche.
7194
why is he such a basket case? he's like regular dave, but like, aloof enigma edition.
7194
maybe it's because he's part bird? i think becoming a bird and a sprite did something weird to him.
7194
normal dave was so much more level headed.
7194
i have to admit, i spend a lot of time wondering what he and rose are up to.
7194
ehh...
7194
maybe it's for the best he broke up with you.
7194
well, what kind of future do you think you would have with him?
7194
he's a sprite. like really, what even is a sprite? how long do they live? will he still be around if we win the new game we are allegedly trying to get to?
7194
there are a lot of things we don't know.
7194
and also...
7194
how do things even work if you marry a sprite?
7194
i mean...
7194
ok, he has a ghost butt, for one thing.
7194
a GHOST BUTT, jade!
7194
i'm just saying...
7194
what? no, i was just...
7194
but
7195
ok, fine.
7195
nothing!
7195
no!!!
7195
well, maybe i'm just getting a little tired of being stuck on this lame boat!
7195
don't you think it's gotten kind of old?
7195
oh sure, i'm sure it's GREAT for you. you get to spend your days smooching and breaking up with dave sprite and what not, and you can shrink down to any old planet you feel like, any time. whereas i have to make this whole big deal of ASKING you to shrink or unshrink me, and...
7195
i know, but you think i want to bug you about that at the drop of a hat? when you're busy and on dates and stuff? i just happen to have respect for something called PERSONAL BOUNDARIES, jade.
7195
and it's not like there's really anyone else to talk to, except the inscrutable chess people and a bunch of brainless consorts and an idiot cat princess. oh and also nanna, but i mean, she's my grandmother, and she's great, but a guy can only spend so much quality time with his grandmother before he starts to feel like kind of a loser whose friends are too busy to spend time with him!
7195
and i still never visit any interesting dream bubbles, and we can't even finish our cool planet quests because the moment we broke through the window all our denizens decided to go back to sleep, and...
7195
i guess what i'm saying is, i'm MORE than ready to get to the other window and meet our friends and other new people and stuff.
7195
are you sure you can't make the ship go faster???
7195
and how fast is that again?
7195
well, can't you use your space powers and bump it up a notch?
7195
and why can't you teleport us again?
7195
is that why we can't go faster than light either?
7195
ok, i mean, i know that. but this isn't really a regular place, right?
7195
isn't the speed of light like a thousand miles a second? so what does that really mean here? are miles and seconds the same here as on earth? how does this nonsense dimension we're racing through jive with all the relativity mumbo jumbo?
7195
no, i don't want to talk about physics! i don't know anything about the laws of physics, because they are hard and boring.
7195
i simply would like them to behave in a way that is most convenient to ME and MY LIFE! is that really asking too much?
7195
well, guess what? SCIENCE IS STUPID BULLSHIT!!!
7195
no.
7195
magic is awesome.
7195
science blows.
7195
the end.
7196
what?
7196
huh?
7197
oh god dammit.
7198
STRIIIIIIDEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!
7199
THAT BASTARD!!!
7199
THIS IS TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS.
7199
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
7199
IT IS THE LAST FUCKING STRAW!!!
7199
RAAARARRAAUUUAAAAUUAGHGHGGHGGGGHHGH!
7200
I'M GOING TO GO KICK HIS ASS!
7200
POSING AS MY DEAD FATHER BY MIMICKING ONE OF HIS GREAT FATHERLY NOTES HE USED TO HIDE AROUND THE HOUSE???
7200
AND ON THE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY HE WAS SLAIN BY JACK NOIR, A *FACT* OF WHICH THAT CHEEKY ORANGE ASSHOLE IS PLAINLY AWARE??????
7200
THIS IS A NEW LOW, EVEN FOR DAVE SPRITE!
7201
NO, SCREW THAT, I AM SUPER PISSED OFF ABOUT THIS!
7201
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SETTLE THIS, AND THAT IS WITH AN OLD FASHIONED BEATDOWN.
7201
WHERE'S MY HAMMER!!!!!
7201
ANY OLD HAMMER!
7201
WHATEVER. IT COULD BE A HAMMER FROM THE BARGAIN BIN OF A HARDWARE STORE FOR ALL I CARE.
7201
JUST GIVE ME ANYTHING THAT'S FIT FOR CLOBBERING A GHOST BOTTOMED DICK FACE WHO'S ALSO A BIRD.
7202
I'M COMING FOR YOU, DAVE SPRITE!
7202
DO YOU HEAR ME, YOU MAGICAL SON OF A BITCH? I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME!
7202
THAT STUNT WASN'T COOL! *YOU'RE* NOT COOL!
7202
LIKE IT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH YOU DUMPED JADE FOR NO REASON. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU!
7202
YOU AND JADE WERE OUR ROCK ON THIS SHIP! YOU HEAR ME?? OUR ROOOOOOOOCK!!!
7202
AND NOW *THIS* BULLSHIT??? WHAT THE HELL, MAN.
7202
I DON'T GO AROUND LEAVING FAKE PUZZLES FOR YOU LIKE FROM THE MOVIE SAW, DO I? HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ME SAY I WANT TO PLAY A GAME EVEN *ONCE*?? WELL, HAVE YOU????
7202
NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD STIR UP PAINFUL MEMORIES OF A DEARLY DEPARTED LOVED ONE, AND THEREFORE WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLY SHITTY OF ME!!!!!!!!
7203
HEY! I SEE YOU THERE!
7203
GET DOWN FROM THERE RIGHT NOW, WISE GUY!
7203
OH NO, DON'T PLAY DUMB. I CAN SEE YOU PLAIN AS DAY. I'M ON TO YOU, BUDDY.
7203
STOP VAGUELY WATERMARKING THE SKY WITH YOUR SMUG DOUCHEY FACE THIS INSTANT AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN!!!
7204
YEAH SURE, LAUGH IT UP! THAT MAKES YOU SEEM LIKE WAY LESS OF A TOOL. NICE GOING BRO!
7204
EVERYONE ON THIS BOAT IS SICK AND TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT! WHY DON'T YOU JUST FLY AWAY AND LEAVE US ALONE?
7204
HOW CAN YOU BE SO MUCH MORE OF A PRICK THAN THE REAL DAVE? YOU ARE THE MOST PISS POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR A BEST FRIEND A GUY EVER HAD.
7204
I CAN'T *WAIT* TO MEET UP WITH THE REAL DAVE AGAIN. THAT WAY WE CAN ALL GO BACK TO THE AWESOME STATUS QUO OF PRETENDING YOU NEVER EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!
7205
oh he's THERE alright.
7205
he's probably just using some sprite magic so only i can see him.
7205
don't you see, jade? he's antagonizing ME PERSONALLY, not you. he's done with you, remember?
7205
he already used you like a rented mule, and now he is moving on to greener pastures.
7205
it's me.
7205
I'M the pastures.
7205
and now his mule is grazing all over them, while he has a good laugh.
7205
no, you see, it's...
7205
the mule represented, like...
7205
i don't know, like the spirit animal of his douchey ways. or something.
7205
augh, WHO CAAARES.
7206
who cares about mules, or pastures, or dave sprite's stupid ephemeral sky visage.
7206
who cares about anything!!!
7206
who cares about my birthday, or nic cage, or this boat full of idiots.
7206
JUST.
7206
WHO.
7206
CARES.
7262
hehe...
7283
huh?
7283
what... the ring?
7283
who are you?
7283
so you found it here, like exactly where i just found it... but then instead of picking it up, you fell asleep?
7283
sorry buddy. as the age old saying goes, you snooze, you lose.
7283
why were you even asleep?
7283
this is such a dumb place to fall asleep, dude.
7283
who?
7283
i know what it means!
7283
no offense, but you seem like kind of a lame troll. i don't think we ever talked before, did we?
7283
no way! it's mine bro.
7283
i dunno. this ring is pretty sweet. the price would have to be pretty steep.
7283
why do you want this desert ring so bad. is it magic?
7283
i don't really feel magic wearing it...
7283
i mean, not any more than usual.
7283
well, i'm not giving it to you unless you have a really good reason.
7284
that's cool. guess i will just enjoy this ring forever, as my property.
7284
yeah right, dude. would an awful guy be wearing such a sweet, priceless ring? i don't think so!
7284
yeah...
7284
you sure did explain that, i guess.
7284
oh!
7284
you want to use it to propose to your girlfriend?
7284
heh... that is not really what i was expecting to hear.
7284
i thought you were just being a greedy treasure grubbing douche.
7284
yes.
7284
but that's a pretty good reason.
7284
i guess i can let you have it, if it is going to result in a happy marriage.
7284
who is the lucky lady, anyway?
7284
who??
7284
hey!
7285
hey...
7285
excuse me, but
7285
are you...
7285
vriska?
7286
uh. that's alright. nice to meet you.
7286
wait...
7286
are you a ghost too?
7286
so... you're dead?
7286
ok, i'm still confused though...
7286
sorry if i sound dumb, but dream bubbles are still kind of baffling to me.
7286
you're, uh... "REALLY" dead?
7286
as in, the real you? i mean... dang, what the hell am i even trying to ask here...
7286
oh.
7286
so when i meet up with everyone on your troll meteor in a year, that means...
7286
you'll be...
7286
...
7286
well,
7286
yeah.
7286
it's always sad to hear a friend died. even if you find out about it from their ghost.
7286
also, i had kind of thought that when we all arrived at the new session, that...
7286
we were going to like... hang out. or something.
7286
wow. what even happened out there?
7286
what? it did?
7286
huh??
7286
wait, i'm with tavros here, i think we should back this up a bit.
7286
so, my alternate reality ghost dated you?
7287
that...
7287
but...
7287
vriska, this is a very bizarre and unsettling fact to me!
7287
because...
7287
man, i don't know, it just is!
7287
you say we dated for a while, but like, i don't even get to remember doing that?
7287
i think that's mostly what's weird about it.
7287
well...
7287
can you at least tell me what happened there? like, how did that go?
7287
oh.
7287
what??
7287
what do you mean he died?
7287
you mean... his GHOST died?
7287
as in, he just doesn't exist at all anymore? like DEAD dead?
7287
i don't... how does that even...
7287
who killed him???
7287
was it jack?
7287
he is not old news though!
7287
he's still as strong and menacing as ever.
7287
i just had an awesome battle with him in this very dream bubble!
7287
yeah. i found him skulking around a memory of my dead dad, and i got pissed off, so i really let him have it.
7287
oh, i even used the cool hammer you helped me make. remember that?
7287
yes.
7287
the last time i faced him was kind of embarrassing. i let him get the drop on me, and he just stabbed me right away.
7287
but this time i think i held my own pretty well. i even got in one good hit against him!
7287
i gave him a solid bop on the head, and the dice roll made him wear a silly hat.
7287
oh really?
7287
i guess so!
7287
yeah, he sure was. but our fight was interrupted by like... another taller, white jack dressed in rags.
7287
well, no, it wasn't actually a jack, it was someone different altogether, who just looked like him. with wings and a sword and everything.
7287
i think the white jack was probably a girl? i'm not sure, but that was my hunch. i didn't talk to her or anything. she looked really angry.
7287
anyway, he seemed scared of her, so he flew away, and she chased him.
7287
do you know who she was?
7287
whatever jack's doing out here in dream bubble land, he seems to have his hands full with her on his tail.
7287
but as you can see, he is FAR from out of the picture.
7287
what guy?
7287
who??
7288
ultimate bad guy?
7288
you mean like the last boss?
7288
ok. if you say so.
7288
i always kind of thought jack was evil and strong enough to be our main antagonist. but if you say there is someone even stronger and more evil, then... wow.
7288
haha.
7288
i see what you mean.
7288
you both seem a bit testy with each other. it's kind of funny.
7288
actually it's a little hard to believe you and he are...
7288
er...
7288
never mind, actually.
7289
i take it you were pretty good friends back on your planet?
7289
um. sure?
7289
oh, right. i remember you said you killed someone that you cared about. i guess this is him?
7289
hmm, i feel like... maybe we got sidetracked there?
7289
maybe you should tell me more about this english guy.
7289
frankly, it seems like i'm usually one of the last people to learn about stuff like this, and it's starting to make me feel like a bit of a tool.
7290
working on what?
7290
oh yeah?
7290
what treasure?
7290
(stop that!)
7290
(keep your hands to yourself.)
7290
(no!)
7290
(dude, you suck at whispering!)
7290
(i changed my mind!)
7290
(quit it!)
7290
(shut up. i'm keeping it.)
7290
(yeah right. like she would even say yes.)
7290
(i don't even think she's really your girlfriend. i think you made that up!)
7290
(you are so full of shit!)
7290
(there's no way you're getting this ring.)
7290
(i am going to wish as super hard as i can that i wake up with this ring.)
7290
(it's probably magic, so i bet it makes my wish come true!)
7290
(if i wish hard enough, that will make it slightly less impossible!)
7290
(i think some day i will use it to propose to *MY* girlfriend. what do you think about THAT, wise guy?)
7290
(this is pathetic.)
7290
(stop grabbing at me! we're missing what she's saying!)
7290
(she's going to think we're idiots, won't you STOP?)
7290
yes!
7292
those are all treasure maps?
7293
um...
7293
where?
7293
a black piece of paper?
7293
oh.
7293
yes, clearly.
7293
would that someone be you?
7296
that is pretty neat.
7296
so does that mean you know where the treasure is now?
7296
encouraging it?
7296
what, you mean like, making him mad so he breaks more... uh...
7296
nothingness?
7296
so that means you have to piss him off i guess.
7296
i am guessing you have an idea what that might be?
7296
so the bait is really you.
7296
ok. how do you know he'll go for it? i mean, how will he actually know you're "looking" for her?
7296
that sounds... optimistic?
7296
heh.
7297
well...
7297
cool!
7297
that was actually a very interesting story, vriska.
7297
you're a pretty good story teller!
7297
oh yeah?
7297
that's... one way of looking at it.
7297
i don't know about excessive minutia or brain peace, but i was hanging on every word!
7297
i wish i could hang out with you longer and maybe even help you with your treasure hunt.
7297
but i just know i'm gonna be waking up soon.
7297
darn. who even knows how long it will be before we meet again in another bubble?
7852
vriska, is that you?
7852
alright.
7853
yeah...
7853
actually hasn't it been exactly a year?
7853
i think it was my birthday last time we met too, heh.
7853
you mean the big treasure hunt, with all those black maps?
7853
uh... mention what, exactly?
7854
by the way, hi tavros.
7854
how have you been?
7854
cool pirate outfit you have there.
7854
i wasn't going to.
7854
no argument here!
7854
what about the rest of your crew?
7854
i remember her, the punky one who always likes to stab me with her spear...
7854
but i really hope she doesn't do that this time.
7854
but i don't know the one who looks kind of like your sister.
7854
what is your name?
7854
hi.
7854
and what about those two over there?
7855
hey.
7855
are you alive?
7855
your eyes do not look spooky and ghostly.
7855
your history? what happened?
7855
wait, that's a rude question. sorry.
7855
jeez, why does everyone always die so much?
7855
what about you... why do you have double eye patches?
7855
i can't tell if you're alive too or not, because i can't see if your eyes are spooky.
7855
half dead?
7855
who's eridan?
7855
um, alright. but i don't think i quite followed all of that.
7855
what does being half dead mean?
7856
and what about all those ships up ahead?
7856
are they part of the treasure hunt too?
7856
isn't an army on boats usually called a navy?
7856
who's in the army?
7857
you mean fighting lord english?
7857
wait, you're mind controlling all those ghosts?
7857
yeah, but...
7857
isn't that still kind of, um...
7857
dickish?
7857
how do you mind control so many ghosts at once?
7857
isn't that kind of hard?
7857
she is?
7857
uh.
7857
(god, trolls are so weird.)
7858
hey!
7858
you snitch.
7858
what?
7859
oh.
7859
sorry.
7860
ok.
7860
what's the story about?
7861
there was a very mysterious alien race called cherubs.
7879
wait...
7879
does that mean when you're a ghost you still have to pee?
7879
that's so weird.
7879
am i the only one who thinks that's weird?
7879
but weren't you already pretty used to peeing when you were alive?
7879
this is kind of a stupid conversation.
7879
can we hear more about the snakes and whatnot? it was a pretty cool story.
7882
the heroine story ends and the villain story begins.
7882
i think...
7906
wait.
7906
leprechauns??
7906
...
7926
hey.
7926
aradia, was it?
7926
can i ask you something?
7926
you seem reasonable, and pretty nice.
7926
so i'm wondering.
7926
how do you feel about all this?
7926
about what vriska and her pirate buddies are doing.
7926
no, i know.
7926
of course it would be great to have an awesome secret weapon, whatever it is.
7926
i mean...
7926
how do you feel about the way they've been searching for it?
7926
by using all your ghost clone friends as bait.
7926
and getting the bad guy to blow them all up to reveal the way to the treasure?
7926
ok, yes.
7926
let's assume it was the only way to find it. granted.
7926
but i mean, does that really make it the right way to beat him?
7926
well, how do you feel about it?
7926
most of the other pirates seem cool with it, so i'm wondering if you feel differently.
7926
um...
7926
sort of.
7926
but i didn't know what you were all doing yet.
7926
yeah, but...
7926
i'm just hanging out here cause i'm asleep! what else was i going to do?
7927
ok, but what about your friends!
7927
don't you care about them?
7927
then why do you seem so...
7927
cheerful?
7927
when so many of them are getting zapped by lasers.
7927
kinda!
7927
...
7927
i'm sorry, maybe i spaced out through some of that.
7927
but i'm still not sure what you're talking about.
7927
maybe you could just simplify it for me.
7927
are you a good guy or a bad guy?
7927
dammit.
7927
ok, could you just... maybe...
7927
give me an idea of what it is you actually want out of all this?
7930
oh my god, you are all so insane!
7931
oh holy shit another story? i'm there!!!
7931
sorry aradia, i'd love to keep chatting, but you heard the lady. it's story time again.
7932
ok. what's this one about?
7932
ogre sex, or salamander shipping, or something?
7935
what's the matter?
7947
hey, vriska.
7947
actually...
7947
you know that ring?
7947
i have it now.
7947
no, i mean, not on me.
7947
i guess i wasn't wearing it when i fell asleep.
7947
it seems to have the power to come with me in and out of my dreams, as long as i'm wearing it.
7947
that's how i got it in the first place. i had it on when i woke up.
7947
i don't know.
7947
i guess...
7947
i liked it, and i just wanted to hang on to it for some reason.
7947
but i didn't know i would wake up with it.
7947
yeah...
7947
maybe.
7948
i'll think about it.
7948
well, yeah.
7948
it sounds like an important item, so deciding what to do with it is kind of a big responsibility.
7948
it's supposed to bring ghosts back to life, but we don't know how it works.
7948
what if it only keeps you alive as long as you're wearing it?
7948
that would mean only one ghost could come back.
7948
but there are a lot of ghosts!
7948
i'm just not sure what to do yet.
7948
yeah, well frankly, i don't give a shit about the orange guy!
7948
the ring is mine for now, so i'm the one who has to figure out what to do with it.
7948
speaking of waking up, it's probably time i got going too.
7948
i'm not trying to join the mutiny or anything, but i do have friends waiting for me out there.
7948
uh...
7948
it's fine. we can stay friends.
7948
i don't really like to make enemies with people, even if they're...
7948
umm.
7949
vriska, i have to be honest. years ago when we first talked, it was a lot of fun to get to know you.
7949
and i admit i thought about you a lot since then.
7949
but i guess i never quite realized how little i actually understood you.
7949
during this crazy treasure quest, i tried to reserve judgment, like maybe it was just a troll thing i didn't get.
7949
but seeing how those other guys felt about it, i think it's more complicated than that.
7949
obviously not all trolls are like you.
7949
and i know i'm not.
7949
maybe this was all for a good cause, but it still felt like a pretty fucked up way to go about it.
7949
and...
7949
all i'm saying is, i'm ready to go. i've seen enough, and i miss my friends.
7949
i'll think about what to do with the ring, but honestly...
7949
again, i am just keeping it real!
7949
but if i am really thinking hard about who i should bring back to life...
7949
i dunno if my conscience can justify bringing back someone so...
7949
dangerous.
7950
you don't?
7950
...
7950
huh?
7950
oh. right.
7950
i guess i'll just be...
7950
wh...
7950
what?
7950
oh.
7950
sure.
7950
i guess i'll go a little further and check out the treasure.
7950
heh, you're right. it would be dumb not to.
7967
me?
7968
what?
7968
we do?
7968
...
7968
ok.
7968
i see.
7968
what's that?
7969
hmm.
7969
alright. then i guess that settles that.
7969
then, uh...
7969
don't?
7969
yes.
7969
my friends mean a lot to me too.
7970
uh, no?
7971
ok, jeez!
7971
i promise no matter what, i won't let you have the ring!
7971
i'll hide it or something. or better yet, i'll just give it to someone else before you get the chance to steal it.
7971
how does that sound?
7973
hang on, i'm coming!!!
7974
so the treasure's in that chest?
7974
are you gonna tell us more about it yet?
7982
(who's she talking to?)
7988
...
7992
ok, i'm not sure what that crazy outburst was about.
7992
i think i'll just let that one go.
7992
but you say this little house thing is intangible?
7992
so i can't touch it?
7992
what happens if i try?
7993
i'm not too worried.
7993
this is just my dream hologram self, or some nonsense.
7993
how many times has meenah stabbed me with her fork?
7993
and i always wake up fine!
7995
ouch!
8107
what.
8109
does this mean...
8110
we're here?
8111
hello???
8111
is anyone there?
8112
jade?
8112
nanna??
8113
jaspers???
8113
dave sprite????
8113
...
8114
... regular dave?
8115
where IS everyone?
8116
this sucks.
8117
...
8118
sigh.
8214
hi dave!
8214
what's so funny?
8215
what were you looking at there...
8215
hey, are you crying?
8215
...
8215
heh, yeah.
8215
can i see?
8215
yes.
8215
uh oh.
8215
dave, i have to go!
8215
i can't hang around in one place for too long.
8215
let's catch up later, ok?
8215
see you buddy!
8231
*deep breath...*
8232
*deep breath...*
8237
whew!!!
8238
oh man, here i go again...
8238
welp. see ya!
8261
hi rose!
8261
nice glasses.
8262
ha ha.
8262
ok.
8262
yeah.
8262
that crap is all over this session.
8262
i'm trying to blow it away wherever i see it, but there's just so much.
8262
nah.
8262
i just know it's super gross!
8262
yes!
8262
i learned how to turn into wind and swoosh around about a year ago.
8262
i was fighting jack and found myself in a tight spot. it was just me and him, facing each other man to man.
8262
but he got the drop on me, and put me in one of his most dastardly choke holds! his deadly blade was poised for a lethal stab through my heart.
8262
i thought for sure i was a goner, when suddenly i poofed away from his tentacly grasp like houdini's slippery ghost. later i rematerialized to seize the tactical advantage!
8262
oh yeah... then i saw you. heh.
8262
oh, hey terezi.
8262
nice to see you again.
8262
yes we did!
8262
briefly, on the stone henge planet.
8262
you all appeared out of nowhere, and we hung out for a little while.
8262
you threatened to cut my throat for some reason, and then laughed, which was weird.
8262
but then you said it was a joke. i didn't really get the joke, but i just kinda let it go.
8262
a whole bunch of things happened, but nobody remembers except me.
8262
what?
8262
yeah.
8262
man, you are such a weirdo.
8262
you're almost as crazy as...
8262
let's not go there now.
8262
nowhere!
8262
suffice to say, i think you and a few other trolls are total nutjobs, no offense.
8262
i still can't believe you and dave...
8262
uh.
8262
actually, let's not go there either.
8263
i dunno.
8263
but i think it might have to do with this new power i have.
8263
it's not a god tier power.
8263
it's something else. something i got when i stuck my hand in a magic thing.
8263
um, that's a long story.
8263
one involving pirates.
8263
i said it's a long story!
8263
anyway, when i put my hand in the thing...
8263
i became all... blurry.
8263
yes.
8263
and i kept randomly getting blurry and disappearing.
8263
and now i think i'm sort of unstuck in existence.
8263
like i'm not fully a part of reality anymore, or bound by the rules governing it.
8263
man, i'm doing a terrible job explaining this.
8263
ok, the bottom line is, now i just randomly disappear sometimes!
8263
and i reappear somewhere else in time and space.
8263
but it's not really like normal time travel.
8263
at least, i don't think so.
8263
with regular time travel, the rules are pretty strict.
8263
either paradox space already accounted for your time traveling, and you were always supposed to do it all along...
8263
or you messed up, and changed something you weren't supposed to. in which case you just made a bad timeline, and everyone dies or something. right?
8263
but this isn't like that.
8263
i'm not sure how i know, but it feels like these jumps are totally outside all those rules.
8263
when i jump somewhere, like in the past...
8263
i think i can actually change stuff that isn't supposed to be changed.
8263
which makes me kinda nervous!
8263
not really.
8263
i mean, not intentionally.
8263
i can't seem to control the jumps.
8263
maybe that's for the best though.
8263
if i could control it, and tried to use it to my advantage, i would probably just make a huge mess of things.
8263
yeah!
8263
ummmm...
8263
well, we were all pretty confused at first.
8263
you all just appeared out of nowhere, and started babbling about evil jade.
8263
you asked me what happened, but i didn't know anything because i just got there myself, and was all alone.
8263
but then it was cool, we all just walked around the land of hills and stone henges, or whatever it's called, and caught up a bit on the last three years.
8263
we were trying to figure out what to do, and decided it would be a good idea to try and meet up with all the new kids.
8263
but we had no idea where they were.
8263
and i still don't, except i have since determined that my teen nanna is evil too.
8263
but she is more like an evil robot than a scary wolf girl. um, but i digress.
8263
so we were planning to make some scouting expeditions to the new planets to look for them, and everything was fine.
8263
that is, until evil jade showed up.
8263
she made you all disappear again, and then came after me, but i used my windy powers to evade her, which really pissed her off!
8263
so she beat the crap out of me. :(
8263
but then i randomly zapped away, and have been running from her ever since.
8263
i am swishing the breeze around like crazy to throw her off my trail, but she keeps finding me.
8263
she's so crafty!
8263
yes, i can try.
8263
what should i do when i find them?
8263
heheh.
8263
alright.
8263
if i see your mom, is there anything you want me to tell her?
8263
yes. i mean, your kid mom, obviously.
8264
:|
8265
rose, these are some really piss poor heart felt messages.
8265
ok, i'll find her. i promise.
8265
wuh-oh.
8265
looks like the jig is up.
8304
er.
8304
i don't know.
8304
whoops. sorry.
8304
i'm SORRY!!!
8304
jeez, it was an accident!
8304
no, no! please don't!
8304
i didn't mean to come here, really!
8304
i still can't control the jumps!
8304
i'm TRYING, but it just...
8304
no, it's not time travel!
8304
well, not technically.
8304
no, i swear!
8304
ok, see, i went on a dream quest with some troll pirates.
8304
argh, never mind. that's the long version of the story.
8304
ok, so i stuck my hand in this little magic house, and...
8304
what?
8304
i know!
8304
i'm sorry, i would zap away again, but i don't know how!
8304
IT'S NOT TIME TRAVEL THOUGH!
8304
i promise!
8304
i dunno!
8304
like, some kind of surreal, history altering... reality hopping... magic power.
8304
no way, dude.
8304
you have to trust me on this.
8304
this isn't a doomed timeline.
8304
i'm telling you, i can change things.
8304
stuff that wasn't supposed to be changed.
8304
and i'm not saying bad stuff won't happen as a result of the things i change...
8304
but at least it won't make a doomed timeline!
8304
the new things that happen will just be...
8304
the stuff that's supposed to happen?
8304
it does?
8304
um, earth to dave.
8304
i already said i don't have a clue what i'm doing!
8304
what was i interrupting?
8304
you were?
8304
aw man, i'm sorry. i am fucking this up so bad.
8304
see, this is what i'm worried about.
8304
even though my random jumps are supposed to be a "safe" form of time travel, i'm still nervous that i might be ruining important events anyway.
8304
like, there was all this crazy stuff that happened to get us here, whether it was good or bad.
8304
and if i fumble around like this accidentally changing all that stuff, then i won't even know what's going on anymore.
8304
maybe no one will!
8304
that's what i'm saying!
8304
things are complicated enough as it is!!!
8304
ok, look...
8304
maybe we can try to minimize my impact on the current situation.
8304
if i fly away, do you think you can do whatever you were going to do in the first place?
8304
do you know what you were going to do?
8304
ok, i'm glad the mayor is alive and well.
8304
but this is exactly what i wanted to avoid!
8304
isn't there some way you could just...
8304
pretend i never showed up, and let this play out the way it was supposed to?
8304
DAMN IT!
8317
(uh oh.)
8318
(hey!)
8318
(you shouldn't be here!)
8318
(wha...)
8319
(what the hell??)
8319
(gotcha!!!)
8333
stop fooling around and go find roxy, you dumb goof!
8334
who's roxy?
8334
OW!
8350
hello?
8350
is uh...
8350
anyone inside that thing?
8351
don't worry, i am not a villain.
8351
i'm just passing through, looking for someone.
8351
i was told to find a girl named roxy.
8351
heh.
8351
yeah, maybe.
8351
do you know her?
8351
really?
8351
have you seen her??
8351
darn.
8351
no, that sounds really dumb.
8351
i would rather just have some straightforward information as to her whereabouts.
8351
can you at least tell me what she looks like?
8351
you just what?
8351
alright, well...
8351
can you tell me where and when you last saw her?
8351
oh my god.
8351
it's you!
8351
how could i possibly fall for such a stupid prank.
8351
what?
8351
yes.
8351
how did you know that?
8351
oh.
8351
it seems like you have me at a disadvantage then.
8351
which is impressive, considering you are in jail, and also in a little green pyramid thingy for some reason.
8351
did you...
8351
did you actually build that thing?
8351
that's cool. it's like a little fort.
8351
i built a fort once in my room. i made it out of a bed sheet, and some cruxite dowels.
8351
then my friend threw it in a bottomless pit.
8351
it was alright.
8351
i wouldn't dare.
8351
aren't you going to come out so i can see you?
8351
is it working?
8351
what are you trying to do exactly?
8351
you made all these cubes??
8351
that's a neat power.
8351
i remember making some of those cubes with my alchemiter.
8351
i think that's what a blank card makes? so yeah, they're super primitive.
8351
but making pumpkins is pretty impressive. they're like... these big ol' vegetables.
8351
well, if you're really having trouble...
8351
i know a thing or two about learning to use god tier powers.
8351
maybe i could help?
8353
huh?
8353
tricks...
8353
i guess i don't know any actual TRICKS per se, aside from how to use some of my powers.
8353
but i don't know if the same tricks apply to using your powers...
8353
i said MAYBE i could!
8353
i dunno, i was just throwing it out there.
8353
like, maybe if i told you about some of the experiences i had when i was learning to do my windy stuff, you might have some kind of... voidey epiphany?
8353
yes.
8353
ok, um,
8353
i've noticed whenever i learn to do new things with my powers, it's usually in response to something. like something important that has to be done.
8353
so why are you trying to make this spike ball?
8353
and how important does it feel to you?
8353
i see.
8353
what actually IS this spike ball, if you don't mind my asking?
8353
then maybe the fact that you're conflicted about it is why you're having trouble?
8353
if you think it's important to make, but don't want to give it to the bad guys, why don't you just...
8353
break out of jail?
8353
then you could try to make the egg at your own discretion, and use it however you think is best.
8353
yeah. it is a tricky situation with grimbark jade on the loose, that's for sure.
8353
but i've been managing to evade her.
8353
i just swoosh the breeze around to hide my scent, and dissolve into wind and fly away if she finds me.
8353
maybe you could do something like that too?
8353
it seems to me if anyone should be able to avoid detection using their powers, it would be a void player.
8353
get it? a void... as in, avoid?
8353
heh.
8353
oh.
8353
right.
8354
ok. where should i start?
8354
you mean like when i first became a god tier?
8354
that's a long story... i was kind of tricked into that.
8354
it might take some setup to understand.
8354
alright.
8354
in that case, i guess it all started on my thirteenth birthday.
8354
which was three years ago, by the way.
8354
i heard about this awesome game, or at least one i thought was awesome, and i wanted to play it with my friends.
8354
but it wasn't so easy to start. i had to get it from the mail, which meant sneaking around the house while avoiding my dad.
8354
which was kind of stupid and childish in retrospect, but blah blah blah.
8354
blah blah blah blah blah.
8354

WHEW!
8357
so that's...
8357
pretty much the whole story?
8357
i left a bunch of stuff out though.
8357
if more important stuff that i forgot occurs to me, i will let you know.
8357
fefeta?
8357
wow.
8357
i'm sorry.
8357
i don't know, that all sounds pretty interesting to me.
8357
sometimes in life, when you look back on things it can feel like it was all boring and uneventful.
8357
but when you really think about it, you remember all these cool things that happened you forgot about.
8357
anyway, if you remember more about your adventure and want to tell me some time, i would love to hear it!
8358
your mom?
8358
well, yeah. but i know her as your daughter.
8358
but i mean, who the hell knows at this point?
8358
there is probably something to that actually.
8358
you were all the first batch of babies, after all.
8358
i think you were literal copies of yourselves?
8358
that's what it supposedly means to be a paradox clone.
8358
oh.
8358
i guess i kind of glossed over this stuff in my story.
8358
but i was the one who made us all in the first place, with a weird cloning machine.
8358
it was no big deal though. i was just messing around with a control panel, and some babies appeared.
8358
come to think of it, we met one other time too.
8358
but you were asleep.
8358
you were floating around in purple pajamas, and i pushed you out of the way of a flying fork.
8358
i almost forgot about that. but yep, that was you alright.
8358
i might have, but the fork stabbed me in the chest, and dream killed my sleep ghost. or something.
8358
you know how it is with dream logic.
8358
yes, exactly.
8358
i guess i didn't think much about it at the time, but i had a sneaky suspicion that's who you were.
8358
you really look a lot like rose.
8358
she is looking for you, by the way.
8358
she told me to go find you. and i did.
8358
so, she says hi.
8358
uh.
8358
she said...
8358
she's looking forward to meeting you?
8358
sure!
8358
there's nothing to be nervous about though.
8358
she's just a nice nerd who likes to read and knit.
8358
speaking of which...
8358
i've been wondering where he is?
8358
i know jade's grandpa is in jail too, getting badgered by my evil nanna...
8358
yes, sorry.
8358
but i have not seen hide nor hair of dave's bro yet.
8358
hmm.
8358
who?
8358
yes.
8358
oh no.
8358
where is she?
8358
...
8358
you're right, that is very concerning.
8358
who is she? would i know of her?
8358
oh!
8358
surprisingly, i know a LOT about that subject.
8358
for instance, did you know they turn into gigantic snakes when they have sex?
8358
i know. weird, right?
8358
that's probably not very relevant to the topic at hand, though.
8358
uh huh.
8358
ohhh.
8358
ok, this is starting to make sense.
8358
i understand. she is your friend.
8358
i would feel the same way.
8358
wait a minute...
8358
i've got it!
8358
i have such a good idea that would solve your problem.
8358
all you have to do is bring her back to life!
8359
easy.
8359
i have a magic ring!
8359
yes!
8359
wait. what do you mean too?
8359
you have a magic ring??
8359
ah.
8359
no, mine doesn't do that.
8359
it brings ghosts back to life!
8359
yes wai. way.
8359
it's back at my house.
8359
i could go get it right now!
8359
it is quite true.
8359
it should be a piece of cake.
8359
you just wear it when you go to sleep, and it comes with you in your dreams.
8359
then you find your cherub friend, put it on her finger, and bring her back!
8359
i think you can only use it once though. so once she's wearing it, it would be hers forever, or at least as long as she wants it.
8359
sure.
8359
it's no big deal, really.
8359
for a while i was hanging on to it, thinking that i might give it to...
8359
aw man, this is going to sound dumb.
8359
there was a girl who i was considering giving it to, for some reason.
8359
remember? she was the diabolical one who figured prominently in my long story.
8359
yes, close enough.
8359
see, she REALLY wanted that ring.
8359
and she found out i had it, and...
8359
honestly, i'm not sure why it even crossed my mind to give it to her?
8359
i guess i was just used to the idea that i liked her for some reason.
8359
at least i thought i did.
8359
it was a stupid idea based on hardly anything. like one day of conversations.
8359
but since i've gotten to know her better...
8359
i don't know.
8359
i think i might actually...
8359
kind of hate her?
8359
yeah, she's...
8359
actually pretty awful!
8359
she's so full of herself, and mean to her friends, and...
8359
dangerous.
8359
really, really dangerous.
8359
yeah. it does.
8359
anyway, i don't think i can let anyone like that have the ring.
8359
no!
8359
it's funny, after spending some time with a person who is legitimately crazy, it becomes easy to tell right away when someone...
8359
isn't?
8359
well, yeah, everyone is a little crazy. i just mean not BAD crazy.
8359
besides, you don't even want the ring for yourself.
8359
you want to give it to someone you care about.
8359
that is what makes you one of the good guys.
8359
what makes you think i'm the leader?
8359
haha, ok. i'll take that as a compliment.
8359
anyway, i'll go get the ring now.
8359
yeah, that's a good plan.
8359
if i had to guess, i'd say you must be the leader of your team squad too, right?
8359
yeah.
8359
but maybe we can do something about that, if we work together.
8359
alright. off i go.
8359
keep practicing your powers!
8359
see you, roxy.
