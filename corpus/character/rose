1963
I understand you have recently come into possession of the beta release of "The Game of the Year", as featured in respectable periodicals such as GameBro Magazine.
1963
I can't control myself.
1963
I must have a weakness for insufferable pricks.
1963
John.
1963
You're wearing one of your disguises now, aren't you?
1963
You are typing to me right now while wearing something ridiculous.
1963
Ok.
1963
Why don't you go get the game from your father?
1963
I know, John.
2035
It looks like you managed to retrieve the beta. Excellent.
2035
I'm going to try to connect.
2035
The rabbit?
2035
I've heard tales of this wretched creature often. Its Homeric legend is practically ensconced in the fold of my personal mythology by now.
2035
Why don't we focus on the matter at hand?
2035
You are running the client application. I am running the server, so I am the host user. I have established a connection with you. This is sufficient for us to play the game.
2035
Why don't we get started?
2041
Sorry. I'm just getting a feel for the controls.
2041
Yes.
2041
I will try to be more careful next time.
2044
I'll give it a shot.
2044
No luck.
2044
It appears to be out of range. I'm guessing it is too far away from you, the "player".
2053
It seems expanding the dimensions of your room cost us some "Build Grist".
2053
But deploying the lathe did not appear to incur any expense.
2053
It looks like certain objects are freebies, probably to help you set up the game.
2053
I think it's up to you to find out.
2053
All I can do is drop stuff in your house, and move it around, apparently.
2053
I don't think you can as the client. You will need to install the server application.
2053
You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.
2053
Did you get another envelope in the mail?
2053
Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.
2053
Are you sure you didn't get it?
2054
Now that your room is bigger, why don't you move to the far corner?
2054
It will extend the range of the cursor, and I can reach the items.
2054
Which... you threw out the window for some reason?
2054
What have you been doing in here all afternoon, anyway?
2054
I like to use trees.
2054
It's not exceptionally practical.
2054
But I think they are elegant.
2057
Yes. Two more large gizmos.
2057
If I had to guess, they appear to facilitate a sort of system involving punch card-based alchemy.
2057
That remains to be seen.
2057
Maybe you should go investigate?
2060
The one you threw into the yard?
2060
What were you doing with it in the first place?
2060
I am not sensing a lot of regard for the personal property of others.
2060
Is this how your pent-up frustration with your father manifests itself?
2060
Your bathroom is a mess.
2060
Did you do that too?
2060
There's a cake in the toilet.
2060
I'm tempted to clean it up for you.
2060
My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder complex?
2060
Can a disorder also be a complex?
2060
Sounds complicated.
2063
Whoops.
2064
No, I have it under control.
2064
You can keep playing with your telescope.
2065
I think I can patch it up.
2065
Just give me a little space.
2065
Why don't you go have a look at the Cruxtruder?
2065
The thing I put in your living room.
2070
There's a door there?
2070
I didn't see it.
2070
I just thought it fit nicely into that groove.
2071
Oh fuck.
2074
Sorry. I keep losing the wireless signal.
2074
Must be the weather.
2074
I would look for a stronger signal in another part of the house, but I'd rather not risk an encounter with my mother.
2074
I battled through her cloud of gin and derision once already this evening.
2074
Yes. Cake, jesters, unfaltering love and support.
2074
Quite a road to hoe there.
2074
Though I suppose I'm complicit for not informing Social Services about your situation.
2074
That presents the same problem.
2074
Also, it's raining, remember?
2074
And dark.
2074
Yes, the sun has already had its way with us here on the east coast.
2074
Its lurid glare has moved on to younger timezones.
2075
Need some help?
2078
I've been looking at the GameFAQ walkthroughs to figure some of this stuff out.
2078
Hold while I read further.
2078
All of these walkthroughs are extremely short.
2078
None progress much further than this point.
2078
True.
2078
Now that the lid is off, you will need to extrude some "Cruxite".
2080
I feel like we should be hurrying. That countdown is making me nervous.
2080
John?
2080
Oh. Your PDA is trapped under the cruxite now, isn't it.
2080
Anyway, it looks like you are going to need this card too.
2084
That is probably the "Kernelsprite".
2084
It apparently needs to be "prototyped".
2084
Twice, actually.
2084
Whatever the hell that means.
2084
These walkthroughs are horrendously written.
2087
That was only "Tier One Prototyping".
2087
There is still another tier to the prototyping process.
2087
Which for all we know merely advances this entity through increasingly esoteric states of linguistics.
2087
This unmitigated poppycock?
2087
The alchemiter?
2087
Try to learn the lingo.
2100
Your dad is getting home.
2100
John?
2100
What did you do with your PDA this time?
2100
I'm working on the bathroom.
2100
But we are running low on Build Grist.
2104
I'm working on the bathroom.
2104
But we are running low on Build Grist.
2104
I see.
2104
Do you suppose it has anything to do with the game?
2104
I think it's very likely.
2104
The walkthroughs vaguely suggest an impending threat before they end.
2104
The already poorly constructed sentences become even more curt and ambiguous.
2104
As if written hastily and with a sense of alarm.
2104
Actually, their dedication to updating the walkthrough under such circumstances is admirable.
2104
If the meteor is a game construct, I think the only thing to do is to proceed, and try to solve the dilemma on the game's terms.
2104
Try using the lathe.
2104
It says you can use the card on it, but isn't more specific than that.
2104
Really, it is a labor to read this drivel.
2104
If I read any more my brain will need to be spoon-fed from a jar.
2104
While it blows spit bubbles in a highchair.
2104
I think I will write my own walkthrough.
2104
That is, after we make sure you don't die.
2140
I'm back.
2140
Patience. You still haven't used the new totem.
2140
I believe it will create the item on the punch card.
2140
We'll see.
2140
I've found no evidence that anyone has successfully created the item.
2140
And the content of the card appears to be variable from session to session.
2140
In one instance it was described as an "eggy loking thign" [sic].
2140
According to the Atheneum, it is a free item.
2140
This speaks to its importance, in my view.
2140
Now off you go.
2156
John?
2156
Are you there?
2156
I know.
2156
I've been watching you scramble through the house like a lunatic.
2156
You should have answered me sooner.
2156
No. I'm sure he'll turn up.
2156
We have more important things to address right now.
2156
I don't know that either. But I've determined your neighborhood was destroyed by the meteor. Wherever you were transported, it saved you from the impact.
2156
I've been reading reports in the news. Over the last few days, there have been many smaller meteor collisions with people's homes around the world.
2156
And they seem to be getting bigger. Yours was the biggest they've identified so far.
2156
Perhaps.
2156
Yes, but wait.
2156
We should retrieve your PDA. Yet again.
2156
It will help to keep tabs on each other while you investigate.
2156
I think I can get you closer to it, if I can replenish our grist supply somewhat.
2156
There may be a way to recycle some that we already used.
2156
I'll meet you out on the balcony.
2156
What?
2156
I was working on something to send you, but I was running late with it.
2156
I didn't want you to think I believed meager well wishes alone would suffice for the occasion.
2156
That said, happy birthday, John.
2168
John, are you ok?
2168
You seem a bit tentative.
2168
Perhaps the early symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like post-traumatic stress?
2168
Well, if you can pull yourself together, there are a few more things we should try.
2168
Like prototyping the Kernelsprite again, if possible.
2168
We should hurry. My laptop battery won't last forever.
2175
We have to hurry along. I'm running low on battery power.
2175
I doubt it matters.
2175
We might as well just use any old crap lying around.
2178
See if you can distract it.
2178
I'll try to sneak up on it.
2183
I can't find it anywhere in the house.
2183
No time to worry about it.
2183
The next thing we should do is get your server copy of the game from the car.
2183
You need to connect to my client, so I can repeat your steps and presumably join you, wherever you are.
2183
We should do this quickly, before my house burns down.
2183
There will be soon.
2183
It looks like it requires a lot of grist to move.
2183
I don't have enough to relocate the door, either.
2183
Zero.
2183
I have a better idea.
2183
Meet me upstairs.
2189
I'm lifting the car up to the balcony.
2189
Once it is up, retrieve the game. Then I'll put it back down on the driveway.
2189
Then break a window.
2189
It's just a window, and this is sort of an emergency.
2189
Otherwise I promise I'll handle the car with velvet gloves.
2233
In some cultures the persistent refusal of a lady's invitation to play a game with her would be a sign wanton disrespect.
2233
Either that, or flagrant homosexuality.
2233
I know.
2233
Sometimes I wonder how you are ever allowed to pay for meals in restaurants.
2233
It must be hard to keep a low profile when you're always overhearing awed voices whisper, "It's that guy who has a blog."
2233
Navigating the urban landscape I'm sure is difficult enough without an obstacle course of deferential flesh and skyward asses.
2233
Perhaps adapting the art of parkour to your unique environment would help?
2233
Heavy is the crown.
2233
Breathtaking magnanimity!
2233
Indeed, nary a jewel tumbles from your wishbox of daily exploits which I imagine does not sparkle.
2233
Baseless accusation!
2233
I know this very well.
2233
I cannot hasten his mail's delivery, however.
2233
More than you know.
2233
It perfectly mollifies my grief over the demise of chivalry.
2319
No. For now I have retired to the safety of a smaller building which is much closer to the forest fire threatening my residence.
2319
Working on it?
2319
You're referring to your brother's collection?
2319
I've seen his websites.
2319
I like them.
2319
Interesting...
2319
I am currently scrawling notes furiously into one of the many psychoanalysis journals I maintain for you. Published papers forthcoming.
2319
Because, you know, it's not like either of us have anything better to do at the moment than to evaluate each other's radically debilitating pathologies.
2319
He won't answer me either.
2319
But I am watching him.
2319
I suspect he is preoccupied with the fact that he just had a bucket of water dumped on his head by the ghost of his dead grandmother, who also happens to be dressed like a clown.
2342
Hello, and thanks.
2342
I just opened it this very moment. What a stunning coincidence you would ask about it now. I am stunned.
2342
And who said it was something from which something else could be made?
2342
I suppose I'll take a stab at learning the craft.
2342
It's the least I can do in response to the subtle dig concealed in his gesture.
2342
He often tells me I "need a new hobby" when I make perfectly reasonable analytical remarks.
2342
Maybe.
2342
His birthday is in a few months, isn't it?
2342
Years?
2342
It's so hard to tell when you're joking.
2342
Or if you're even capable of it.
2342
I'll probably craft something with strong sentimental value.
2342
That should burn him.
2342
I guess not.
2342
So, shall I expect a green package dropped to my house via airmail from whatever screwball cranny of the globe you're tucked into?
2342
Oh?
2342
This is already intriguing enough to compensate for the grave scarcity of lavish gifts parachuting from the sky. Please go on.
2342
Yes.
2342
"ok well", I didn't mention it was a cat, or that it was a male. Let's pretend I'm surprised and you're embarrassed and move on.
2342
To answer your question, I would describe my feelings toward the animal as lukewarm.
2342
If someone told me that, I would regard the remark with a great deal of skepticism.
2342
If that someone was you, on the other hand, then I would have to ask preemptively:
2342
Is that someone you?
2342
So what is this game?
2342
I'll see what the word on the street is about it. In due time.
2342
For now I should probably order a copy of Knitting for Assholes. It would be a shame if I ran late with John's present.
2369
No. For now I have retired to the safety of a smaller building which is much closer to the forest fire threatening my residence.
2369
Working on it?
2369
You're referring to your brother's collection?
2369
I've seen his websites.
2369
I like them.
2369
Interesting...
2369
I am currently scrawling notes furiously into one of the many psychoanalysis journals I maintain for you. Published papers forthcoming.
2369

2369

2369
But I am watching him.
2369
I suspect he is preoccupied with the fact that he just had a bucket of water dumped on his head by the ghost of his dead grandmother, who also happens to be dressed like a clown.
2370
John, what are you doing?
2370
Snap out of it.
2370
We ought to discuss what your grandmother told you, don't you think?
2370
Fine. Enjoy your stupor.
2370
I'll go about my business elsewhere.
2371
John, whenever you read this, you should know I put the shale you collected to use and finally deployed the Punch Designix.
2371
It is in your study.
2371
I can only drop it though. You'll have to be the one to mess around with it and see what it does.
2371
When you're finished with your weird histrionics, maybe you could give it a try?
2371
I'm updating my walkthrough, and it would help to know what it does.
2372
Also, I should probably warn you that your house and yard are completely infested with monsters now. Try to be careful.
2373
Oh, there you are.
2378
Sorry.
2378
No nuance to these controls at all.
2378
I was hoping to bludgeon the imp without letting go of it. Guess I can't really do that.
2378
A broken piano isn't the end of the world though.
2378
You'll need to pick up the spoils in person. I can't interact with the grist.
2378
Yes. Is there a problem?
2378
You're right, that does sound dumb.
2378
Yeah.
2378
You could say that.
2378
Maybe.
2382
There you go.
2382
Now why don't you check out the Designix?
2382
You can do that while I get to work.
2384
Nanna said to build, so that's what I'm doing.
2384
But this sure is going to take a lot of grist.
2384
Looks like you're going to be busy, John.
2384
Stairs.
2384
They are fairly expensive actually.
2385
I'll try recouping some of the grist from the catwalk I built earlier.
2385
Ah, good. Looks like I can get a refund for earlier allocations.
2385
Ok.
2385
Consider me fully briefed on the matter of stairs.
2385
Now if you don't mind, it's hard enough to concentrate on this without immersing ourselves in Strider's non sequitur.
2385
Does he?
2405
I blocked the entrance to the study to give you some space to work with the Designix.
2405
John, imps behind you.
2405
Should I take care of it?
2405
You trapped your PDA again, didn't you.
2405
Why did you have to pick up all that stupid shaving cream?
2405
So pointless.
2413
Ladders seem to be a bit cheaper than stairs.
2422
What is the specific problem?
2422
You know you like the mannequin dick. Accept it.
2422
Let's put this into perspective. You put up with the puppet prostate because you love it.
2422
Also, coarse is a good word.
2422
Are you going to start rapping about this?
2422
Prong of flesh bereft of home
2422
Found solace 'twixt a cleft of foam.
2422
Of apocalypse your thoughts eclipse
2422
A painted pair of parted lips
2422
That dare through kiss to stir the air
2422
That teases tufts of orange hair.
2422
And though faces flush in lovers' fits,
2422
Hands snug in plush as gloves befit.
2422
Then let's hope there will be a squishy derriere somewhere below the handle to break your fall.
2437
John, I'm about to throw a bath tub through your wall.
2437
Watch out.
2438
I made a shortcut upstairs. I thought it would be a good idea to get up there and try the cards as soon as possible.
2438
Also, you weren't being terribly responsive.
2438
They're perfectly navigable.
2438
I'm saving on grist for now.
2438
If you keep slaying foes, collecting grist, and expanding the cache limit, we may not need to be so economical with our resources in the future.
2439
Have you ever been in there?
2439
Exactly.
2439
I'd rather not get sidetracked.
2439
I'm more interested in further exploring the mechanics of the game than watching you discover what sort outlandish harlequin decor your father keeps in his room.
2439
Will you?
2439
Are you saying you've never wondered what's in there? Or why it's been kept a secret from you?
2439
Then trust me. You won't be going "right on through."
2439
I don't know.
2439
I can't see in there.
2439
But I don't have a very good feeling about it.
2451
Wait, John, before you punch that.
2451
Oh.
2451
I was about to say.
2451
If you first took note of the code, then removed the card from the card, you could have punched the blank one.
2451
You would have only burned one card instead of two.
2511
What is the specific problem?
2511
You know you like the mannequin dick. Accept it.
2511
Let's put this into perspective. You put up with the puppet prostate because you love it.
2511
Also, coarse is a good word.
2511
Are you going to start rapping about this?
2511
Prong of flesh bereft of home
2511
Found solace 'twixt a cleft of foam.
2511
Of apocalypse your thoughts eclipse
2511
A painted pair of parted lips
2511
That dare through kiss to stir the air
2511
That teases tufts of orange hair.
2511
And though faces flush in lovers' fits,
2511
Hands snug in plush as gloves befit.
2511
Then let's hope there will be a squishy derriere somewhere below the handle to break your fall.
2522
Yes.
2522
I brought the totems out to the alchemiter to test them.
2522
I'm taking some things into my own hands to save some time.
2536
What did you do?
2536
I see.
2536
That was a really good idea, John. Nice work.
2536
Who?
2536
No.
2543
Sweet catch?
2543
I can't interact with you directly, or anything that you are touching, if it will result in moving you.
2543
See?
2543
The game probably regards that as a kind of cheating.
2543
In a way, thieving you of your free will as an adventurer, and the need to advance by your own skill and ingenuity.
2543
The server player is just a facilitator.
2543
No, you should pick up your hammer and defend yourself.
2543
I have no idea what the hell Dave is up to, or if he's any closer to recovering the game.
2543
There's some stuff I'd like to try, in case he doesn't come through.
2738
I require a font of frighteningly accurate yet infuriatingly nonspecific information.
2738
Do you know where I can find a wellspring of this sort?
2738
You have plans?
2738
Enter?
2738
This is what I was talking about.
2738
This was the itch that needed scratching.
2738
My avarice for the inscrutable. It is limitless.
2738
You've been insisting today was the big day.
2738
We would all play a game you didn't know the name of.
2738
A game you said I'd get in the mail, and did.
2738
One that would help me answer some questions.
2738
But Strider is being obtuse, I can't catch John at his computer, you don't even have the game yourself, and on top of all that, my internet is unstable.
2738
So are you sure today is the day?
2738
Is there nothing else you can say to prepare me for this?
2738
I'm sure you think little of blithely upsetting dark forces with Grandpa Moreau over there on Hellmurder Island, but honestly I've only read a few books on it.
2780
Good work, John!
2780
For now. I'll have to leave again shortly.
2780
It looks like there's another large meteor headed for...
2780
My present location.
2780
Not yet.
2780
I'll explain later.
2780
But I think I've determined that activating the timer in the game is not directly responsible for summoning a meteor to your location.
2780
The countdown seems merely to exist as a kind of warning to the player.
2780
As well as a strange coincidence.
2780
Probably not at the moment. And certainly not to you.
2780
I have to go.
2780
P.S. Try not to waste too much of that grist while I'm gone.
2903
That's quite a totem collection.
2903
What are you planning?
2903
No, that was the nearby forest, which up until quite recently would have been best described as "on fire".
2903
But you may be excited to learn that just as recently, my house finally notched that achievement.
2903
Thank you. Have you seen Dave?
2903
Ok.
2903
I'm going to start putting this grist to use too.
2903
Let's be sparing with the frivolous knickknack breeding and focus on getting you up to the gate, ok?
2903
Gushers?
2903
Which posters?
2903
John.
2903
Are you suggesting that imps are responsible for defacing your movie posters?
2903
Your posters have looked like that ever since I first saw your room.
2903
The moment we started playing this game.
2903
I thought you had defaced them ironically to mock your father's interests.
2903
John?
2903
...?
2904
This is good.
2904
Laughter is probably the best way to avoid being especially melodramatic about the revelation.
2922
I keep telling you the posters were always like that.
2922
Here, look.

Even if I had the motive for such a bizarre and pointless deception, where would I find the time?
2922
I don't even have Photoshop.
2922
I had no reason to think you were not aware of them.
2922
I thought they were strange, certainly, but was not struck by any particular impulse to discuss them.
2923
It looks like you were in your father's room recently.
2923
And how did it make you feel to discover what was in there?
2923
Maybe I am just being a friend?
2923
That doesn't matter.
2923
What matters is how seeing it affected you.
2923
I think it clearly has in some way.
2923
Is it fair to say this changed your perception of your father?
2923
Is it such a stretch to conclude it changed your perception of other things as well?
2924
I don't like to use the word "crazy".
2924
That was a joke.
2924
But anyway, whether it means you are crazy or not, consider this theory:
2924
Your presumably longstanding tendency for scrawling this imagery is really your subconsious trying to express something disturbing within you.
2924
Possibly something from your past, which you have blocked out.
2924
And since you have supressed it, your conscious self cannot acknowledge the drawings, therefore they have been invisible until now.
2924
Perhaps because you have seen evidence that conflicts with the worldview your subconscious has constructed to obfuscate the truth.
2924
That your dad is not necessarily the clown-loving maniac you thought he was.
2924
All along, this negative attribute buried in your psyche may have been projected on to him, and subsequently reviled, as a sort of defense mechanism.
2924
Is it unthinkable that over the years it was he who believed you were the one with a passion for clowns? Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?
2924
A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.
2924
Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.
2924
Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.
2924
It's awesome.
2925
I'm trying to spread the upward construction around so there is a more substantial foundation for later on.
2925
But I'm starting to wonder if it will be strong enough.
2925
It's kind of starting to wobble a little.
2925
I don't think brick chimneys were meant to serve this architectural purpose.
2925
I might have to adopt a different building strategy.
2925
Stick to more load-bearing walls, and blockier shapes, especially since grist has been easier to come by lately.
2925
Right.
2993
Have we spoken before?
2993
You and your friends never cease to invent ways to strengthen the credibility of your assertions.
2993
I would admire the sophistication of you and your fellow future-dwellers a little more if you seemed to be aware the word "human" only functions as that sort of adjective in bad science fiction.
2993
But I won't be rude and change the subject.
2993
There's a still a bit of unflagellated straw poking out of your rhetorical effigy over here.
2993
I thought you said we spoke in the future.
2993
I understand.
2993
You exist in some temporal stratum through which you have communication access to various points of my timeline.
2993
It's not that complicated.
2993
I try to every day, with mixed results.
2993
But you see, it's not that I don't understand you.
2993
It's just that I don't believe you.
2993
Because it's nonsense.
2993
Albeit persistent and coordinated nonsense.
2993
Why would a bunch of temporally dislocated trolls want to harass a group of friends throughout completely random points in time?
2993
Alright.
2993
Maybe you should get some trolling tips from us humans.
2993
Our sparing intellects are probably better suited to it.
2993
You want to be my friend?
2993
You mean I did in the future?
2993
Probably because I remembered you mentioning it in the conversation we're having now?
2993
Hmm.
2993
Your commitment to this roleplaying scenario is intriguing.
2993
What choice do I have but to accept?
3048
Where doing this man?
3048
Go on.
3048
What is it where making this?
3048
Excellent.
3048
Let's make shit take place.
3299
Hold please.
3301
Jade is connected with you?
3301
Where did she get the discs?
3301
Wait.
3301
So you mean to tell me she was able to connect with you in a timely fashion, without waiting until you were on the brink of annihilation?
3301
I've done nothing but wait for boys to play this game with me all day.
3301
First John lollygagging with the client, and then you with the server, downright filibustering my existence with unending fraternal melee.
3301
And yet a girl, one who didn't even own the game, was able to connect with you minutes after you connected with me.
3301
And there she goes.
3301
She HAS the karma.
3302
I was talking to someone.
3302
You remember the trolls?
3302
One of them messaged me, so I indulged him/her/it for a moment.
3302
I also took a moment to check on John.
3302
I can't see him anymore. Just his empty house.
3302
But I did talk to him briefly.
3302
I know.
3302
It's hard to say for certain.
3302
But I think I like it here.
3423
I guess one could use those words to describe it.
3423
If armed with a predilection for the inapt.
3423
Eerily iridescent?
3423
I certainly don't see any oily rivers.
3423
There's an ocean though.
3423
Yes, one of them is bugging me now.
3423
I thought it was odd timing.
3423
Color my curiosity piqued, I guess.
3423
Eventually.
3423
Pardon the envy I'm about to vent in your direction.
3423
For finding yourself at the mercy of a rational orchestrator.
3423
You don't feel weird when I watch you?
3423
I can't see you now, for what it's worth.
3423
Ok.
3423
Bye, John.
3424
Now I'm confused.
3424
On the surface, this appears to be another contrivance from a troll desperate to offend.
3424
But John said you wanted to be friends.
3424
And if you knew me, I suppose your remark could be construed as a ploy to elicit agreement.
3424
And soon, rapport.
3424
Not that it would actually work.
3424
So which is it?
3424
You smell words?
3424
Right. Aliens, I forgot.
3424
Gross.
3424
Still not sure if I'm being courted or trolled here.
3424
By later on, you mean now?
3424
Then you're in luck.
3424
Because you don't.
3424
John was told you were moving backwards through time.
3424
Was he gullible to believe this?
3424
Or is the fact that I'm asking just further indication of my own gullibility?
3424
Feel free to continue shifting the definition of the word to suit your convenience.
3424
Alright, let's continue milking my human gullibility and say I believe you. You're the sensible one who's decided to communicate with us in linear lockstep with our timeline in order to help us out.
3424
How can you help me?
3424
Yes.
3424
Yes.
3424
It's not so subtle, actually.
3424
A beautiful soulgrudge this cosmic was surely authored by the constellations.
3424
You mean, for instance...
3424
If a player were to learn she was a "Seer"?
3424
And this voice?
3424
Exiled from what?
3424
Paradox space?
3424
I'm starting to see that.
3424
So the exiles are on Earth? Does that mean our goal is to get back there too? To resurrect it somehow?
3424
You never answered the question. Where were they exiled from?
3424
What are agents?
3424
When?
3488
Right now?
3488
The spoils would sink.
3488
And then what?
3488
That sounds malicious.
3488
That was self defense.
3488
Murdering a wounded behemoth in its sleep strikes me as unseemly.
3488
Maybe you could replicate a pillow I could use to smother it.
3488
Make it a clean hit.
3488
I would use one of mine but they've all mysteriously gone missing.
3488
Does John know we've been sapping his grist yet?
3488
Hold on, someone's messaging me.
3490
Who?
3490
Why would someone wear sunglasses while using a computer?
3490
I know that anyone committed to such an affectation could only be striving to mask a severe insecurity complex, and likely harbors a crisis of self-image.
3490
I've been known to lend my charitable attention to such people, but only "bossed around" by them insofar as the psychiatric professional has cause to humor the demented for analytical purposes.
3490
Or maybe as a lab chimp commands the zookeeper's interest in its shit by forcing him to duck under its trajectory now and then.
3490
Oh, that guy.
3490
Tender spots?
3490
Your word choices are evocative.
3490
Is your design to couple with this gentleman?
3490
If you're trying to get his goat, you should know he only stocks the animal in the first place for ironic purposes.
3490
Then we're agreed; you are hellbent upon literally seizing his shrill, bearded livestock.
3490
I'll assist you.
3490
If you really want to burn him, I recommend poetry.
3490
Yes. They are the most delicious bunches we have.
3490
I suggest you serve these crisp bunches of honey and verbal annihilation to him as part of a complete breakfast.
3490
A deft cluster-bombing of this sort will leave nothing wriggling from the razed earth.
3490
Except sulfurous tresses while it cracks and turns black.
3490
Yeah.
3490
I suppose what I'm saying is this.
3490
Drop some hard, peer-reviewed motherfuckin' science on his ass.
3490
Some seriously government funded shit.
3490
It will destroy him.
3490
Your obvious cunning with words should depants Strider with such vivid empyrean tempest, a nether-regional sonic boom is certain inevitability.
3490
But even so.
3490
Consider me at your disposal to help craft a comeuppance of such unqualified devastation, the angels will weep pearlstrings of little urban fellows cantillating an unbroken chorus of Oh Snaps.
3490
uMMMM,
3492
I think you're shrewd to have recognized his ploy of sabotage, and you've earned my compliments.
3492
What is?
3492
What's that?
3492
Yes, but you said it wasn't the first time you spoke to me.
3492
We'll graciously omit my embarrassing skepticism however.
3492
This conversation doesn't sound like your first time either.
3492
And when exactly does your maiden encounter take place?
3492
So to clarify.
3492
If the matching of my first with your second is denoted by 1=2, then the sequence would be:
3492
1=2, 2=7, 3=1, 4=?, ...
3492
Why is it that when the subject of temporal mechanics is broached your sparing troll intellects etcetera etcetera.
3492
You mean based on the first impression I am apparently about to make in our next conversation?
3492
What could I possibly say that will leave such an imprint?
3492
I guess being forced to cooperate with a stable time loop is the only plausible explanation for my remarks.
3492
And what if my counter-counter measure is to choose not to transcribe this dialogue accurately in the future-first place?
3492
Unless I decide to copy it word-for-word!
3492
So your trolling strategy now is to put idiotic words in my mouth through the machinery of temporal inevitability, and cause me to excruciate over how to subvert the transcription?
3492
While being perfectly up front about it?
3492
I'll admit, it's a more advanced tactic than I gave you credit for.
3492
Mixed metaphor aside, usually ninjas don't announce what they're doing when they're doing it.
3492
Like when stalking an emperor to assassinate him.
3492
Or befriend him.
3492
But that's fine.
3492
I guess the only pointless question we haven't exhausted is, why?
3492
Why the convoluted artifice?
3492
So you're not only rigging the first impression I make on you, but orchestrating my revenge for the rigging as well?
3492
That's an interesting take on it.
3492
But now I know for sure Dave isn't behind this plan.
3492
It's too complicated.
3492
You're awfully quick to his defense.
3492
Are you sure you don't have a thing for him?
3492
It's ok, bro. You can admit it.
3492
Ok.
3492
I'm going to talk to my dead cat.
3526
Is that all you have to say?
3526
I thought you were supposed to be more helpful after your resurrection.
3526
Like a ghostly spirit guide. Wise, if frustratingly cryptic.
3526
Actually, cryptic behavior would be welcome at this point.
3526
This is just inane.
3526
Should I report to the others that my Kernelsprite is a Lolcat?
3526
Maybe Dave can take some screen captures and overlay some poorly spelled captions.
3526
Assuming he hasn't already.
3526
What are you doing there, by the way?
3526
Oh. So you can talk.
3526
Who?
3526
I think there might be some tuna in the cabinets.
3526
Jaspers, the message you gave me years ago before you disappeared...
3526
What did you mean?
3526
Sigh...
3526
I don't understand.
3526
Is there some meaning to these responses, or are you just being obstinate?
3526
Am I asleep?
3526
Sort of.
3526
It sounds like you aren't exactly in complete command of this information yourself, so I won't press you on it for now.
3526
You're a pretty good cat, Jaspers. I missed you.
3527
I spoke with Jaspers.
3527
I didn't understand what he told me.
3527
He said I'll understand once I "wake up".
3527
For some reason this made me think of you.
3527
We wouldn't happen to be talking about awakening in a sort of breezy, philosophical sense, would we?
3527
Is my dead cat concerned with my enlightenment? Should I prepare to shed this coil of ignorance and suffering?
3527
I doubt I could reproduce the statements with fidelity.
3527
It was like listening to a five year-old describe a dream.
3527
The content manages to take a back seat to the simple heartwarming spectacle of the moment.
3527
I think I get it.
3527
I take it your "dream self" is wide awake when you sleep?
3527
And would I be out of line in additionally presuming this has been the case for many years, at least as long as I've known you?
3527
That was to be my next wild presumption.
3527
So when I wake up, can I look forward to being able to message people in my sleep too?
3527
Oh, right.
3527
I forgot about your robot.
3527
My short term recall seems to eschew the profoundly ridiculous.
3527
I'm not sure if necessity is a concept I'd associate with such a contraption even under some of the more obscure scenarios imaginable.
3527
But good to know I guess.
3527
Here's another question, which I'm sure will look stupid once I've finished typing it.
3527
If my dream self is asleep, does that mean she's dreaming, and if she is, who's dreaming the dream, her or me?
3527
Ok. How do I wake up?
3527
What stuff?
3527
Tell me what?
3527
Are you saying he said I defaced the walls of my room?
3527
While not appearing to be cognizant of the scrawlings?
3527
Like John?
3527
I really hope that's not what you're saying.
3527
It might freak me out.
3527
Hold on.
3528
Strider.
3528
I need you to do me a favor.
3528
Can you take a capture of my bedroom and send me the file?
3528
For no reason in particular?
3529
He's not answering.
3529
Can you hassle him via Sburb and tell him to talk to me?
3529
Bop him on the head with a puppet or something?
3530
Can you do it anyway?
3530
Did he tell you what I wrote on the walls?
3530
Wait.
3530
What?
3543
Already?
3543
It just sounds like you're making a rash decision based on temporary aggravation with a laughing puppet.
3543
I thought we planned to progress as far as we could before you went back.
3543
To gather information, and avoid repeating mistakes.
3543
We don't know Jade is dead for sure.
3543
Are you sure you're ready?
3543
You'll remember the plan we discussed?
3543
It still seems hasty to me.
3543
Maybe I'm just not as comfortable with time travel as you.
3543
After you go, what do you think will happen to me?
3543
Will I just cease to exist?
3543
Maybe?
3543
Is there a chance it'll continue to exist, and I'll just be here alone forever?
3543
I'm not sure which outcome is more unsettling.
3543
What do you think I should do?
3543
Ok.
3543
I think the true purpose of this game is to see how many qualifiers we can get to precede the word "self" and still understand what we're talking about.
3543
If my past self can wake up sooner, maybe I'll be the one to visit you first this time.
3543
I'll fly by and remind you you're already awake and don't know it.
3543
Good luck.
3553
Strider.
3553
I need you to do me a favor.
3553
Can you take a capture of my bedroom and send me the file?
3553
For no reason in particular?
3553
He's not answering.
3553
Can you hassle him via Sburb and tell him to talk to me?
3553
Bop him on the head with a puppet or something?
3553
Can you do it anyway?
3553
Did he tell you what I wrote on the walls?
3553
Wait.
3553
What?
3614
she's not here right now, she's asleep!
3614
but ok, see you.
3614
umm... no?
3614
oh, yeah.
3614
that's me! i am the rose human. look at me, i am so smart with all these snooty words and complicated things to say.
3614
i am the queen of books.
3614
fffuuhhhhhhhh
3614
i'm so burned, these burns are crazy.
3614
can we just cut to the chase and be friends already??
3614
these cat and mouse games are so dumb, you know we're just going to all be friends at some point anyway.
3614
i don't know, uh, maybe???
3614
it's hard to keep track with all your time nonsense.
3614
that's because you guys always do things the hard way.
3614
and the dumb way.
3614
haha, well i know what you guys look like.
3614
you look kind of like...
3614
howie mandel from little monsters.
3614
even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.
3614
because he was a big goofy adult.
3614
and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.
3614
no, it's a movie.
3614
you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.
3614
yeah, i got him this really cool bunny for his birthday, and it's really nicely knitted and everything.
3614
because i am basically in love with him, you are right.
3614
heh, just kidding. i'm sure john knows it's cause i am really thoughtful and i bet he really appreciates the present, and would say thank you if he were here!
3614
why don't you talk to john?
3614
oh man, i don't know.
3614
why don't you pick the time that will make the most complicated mess out of everything imaginable?
3614
you know that's what you're gonna do anyway.
3614
ok.
3614
if you talk to him in the past...
3614
he'll understand even less buggywhipped fuckall about time, and he'll be confused.
3614
so maybe paste something from this conversation to him? i don't know.
3614
and if you talk to him in the future...
3614
he'll probably know all this stuff, like things you've said to him but haven't said yet!
3614
and then you'll be confused.
3614
sorry, that's just how this works.
3614
don't say i didn't warn you!
3614
yeah, bye!
3614
(heheheheheheh)
3757
I'm not.
3757
This book contains a genetic code.
3757
The gods from the Furthest Ring asked me to.
3757
How did you know I wrote a story about wizards, anyway?
3757
This story sounds suspicious.
3757
No, I don't actually mind.
3757
Too bad I missed him.
3757
I like wizards.
3757
What I don't like is my mother's obsession with feigning interest in them to antagonize me.
3757
No, I told you.
3757
It's one of the gene sequences locked in my subconcious.
3757
The gods say it's critical to destroy it.
3757
When I was asleep.
3757
Yes.
3757
When I flew to your tower, I heard them.
3757
They're far above, in the dark sky.
3757
Aren't you often distracted?
3757
By music and puppets?
3757
Have you ever looked into the sky without your shades?
3757
Maybe you should try it some time.
3757
You're the prince of the moon.
3757
I'm sure they've been meaning to seek a royal audience.
3757
What do all these dots mean.........
3758
I just explained this to Other Dave.
3758
Do I have to explain everything to you twice now?
3758
Oh, I see.
3758
So instead of having to double explain, I merely have to put up with being double spied upon.
3758
What a relief!
3758
I know.
3758
But now it's not.
3758
You appeared to make it relevant by traveling to the past.
3758
I remember some things.
3758
I don't know.
3758
But the gods were pretty emphatic about it.
3758
Have you ever known them to be wrong?
3758
Is that why you always kept the music turned up?
3758
I guess we'll chalk another riddle up in the solved column.
3758
Yes.
3758
Ok.
3838
Pardon?
3838
I'm a little busy.
3838
That sounds about right.
3838
Honestly, I was looking forward to playing along and reading your Dumb Rose script for our next conversation.
3838
But it turned out there was a perfectly logical explanation for it all.
3838
Imagine my disappointment.
3838
While I imagine yours, once you finally catch on.
3838
I'd love to explain in detail and cause some sort of time paradox.
3838
But you see - and this revelation may be as startling as any -
3838
I'm a little busy.
3838
Yes, that is definitely a conclusion you have just now drawn.
3838
The only thing left to do is ride out the next several conversations while you maintain that understanding.
3838
And while I maintain the chilly facade you have grown to so enjoy from Smart Rose.
3838
Which shouldn't be too difficult, because... have I mentioned?
3838
I'm busy.
3838
Goodbye.
4582
Hi.
4582
Actually, building up your house has been one of the more trivial ways I've passed the time.
4582
Great swaths of the structure may be copied and pasted with little architectural consideration.
4582
I've only bothered to do so while in contemplation.
4582
It's relaxing.
4582
We have a lot of grist.
4582
I don't recall any hard figures off hand.
4582
Last I checked, more than a million units of several different types.
4582
Torrented between the three of us.
4582
Shared, through an application.
4582
I unlocked the disc from your registry, and deployed it.
4582
I convinced your nanna to install it on your computer.
4582
Before an imp threw it out the window, that is.
4582
My methods of persuasion have been improving.
4582
No.
4582
?
4582
Upgrades.
4582
No, your consorts were utilized for that.
4582
Yes. They seem eager to receive simple instruction.
4582
I'm guessing they find their way back to your house to allow the client player to remain productive while the server player is away.
4582
No, they aren't.
4582
Like I said.
4582
Coercion hasn't been much of a problem.
4582
Why don't you tell me what you've been up to first?
4582
I've been curious, but too preoccupied to inquire.
4582
I've noticed.
4582
Did you?
4582
Yes.
4582
I figured that out.
4582
Anything else?
4582
You did?
4582
Are you sure it was her?
4582
That was likely her.
4582
How was she?
4582
That's interesting.
4582
Did she seem happy?
4582
Fair enough.
4582
Investigating, mostly.
4582
Everything there is to investigate.
4582
Information hidden in the lore of our lands, concealed in ruins and riddles.
4582
I'm looking for whatever there is to discover about the game, and more importantly, whatever exceeds its boundaries.
4582
The cloaked traces of myth beyond its scope.
4582
Yes.
4582
It is, in principle.
4582
But it won't happen.
4582
It's not a matter of believing them.
4582
The writing is on the wall. Literally.
4582
This session was never meant to bear fruit.
4582
It's barren, so to speak.
4582
That's why you're our leader, John.
4582
Optimism through stalwart skepticism is a defect not everyone is lucky enough to be cursed with.
4582
Statements like that are also why you're our leader.
4582
Yes, kind of.
4582
Simple.
4582
The objective is no longer to win.
4582
To do as much damage to the game as possible.
4582
To rip its stitches and pry answers from the seams.
4582
We will snatch purpose from the jaws of futility.
4582
Are you ready to wreak some havoc, John?
4592
You're rambling again, Kanaya.
4621
Hi there.
4621
This is it, isn't it?
4621
This is the eighth conversation between us, from your perspective.
4621
As well as mine.
4621
I've been looking forward to this.
4621
Yes.
4621
I have some questions for you.
4622
I'll start with a simple one.
4622
Do trolls have names?
4626
You're rambling again, Kanaya.
4627
Oh?
4627
Sorry to hear you were subjected to that.
4627
It was a little melodramatic in retrospect. Heavy-handed.
4627
But now it's stuck on that server forever, broadcasting the notes of very confused girl sifting through the aftermath of just another pedestrian apocalypse somewhere in paradox space.
4627
Have you ever written a message you regretted instantly upon sending?
4627
That line included?
4627
I'm sure you must regard the walkthrough as pretty quaint.
4627
As a veteran of the game.
4627
At the time?
4627
When exactly did you read it?
4628
Yes.
4628
It's faster this way.
4628
If there's one thing you and your friends regularly remind us, it's that time is not on our side.
4628
Yes, that has been effective.
4628
But you don't know everything, do you?
4628
My current strategy is comprehensive.
4628
Your notes have been helpful, but the facts you've supplied are being cross-referenced with understandings I already have, and data gathered by the sort of means presently on display.
4628
I still have more questions for you, which I will ask in time.
4628
Of what?
4628
Dark magic, you mean?
4628
I don't think they are as nefarious as you might imagine.
4628
Many of them seem to be intent on helping us.
4628
From their whispers in my dreams.
4628
Not much.
4628
But quite a lot in a failed timeline.
4628
And now and then, memories surface from that alternate reality.
4628
Vague memories, but unmistakable in familiarity, like spontaneously remembering a dream from years ago by some inexplicable catalyst.
4628
In that reality, they spoke to me in my sleep and told me much of what I needed to know.
4628
Including what to do to reset our timeline and create the present reality.
4628
I have assurances I'm on the right track.
4628
Surely you must have spoken to the gods by now.
4628
What did they tell you to make you so suspicious?
4628
It was?
4628
This surprises me.
4628
...
4628
Good question.
4628
You didn't actually answer my question.
4628
When was it exactly that you read my walkthrough?
4629
Before you first contacted me?
4629
What do you mean?
4629
My apologies for whatever misstep I may have taken to dispel that impression.
4629
It was an honest mistake, I swear.
4629
...
4629
To whom?
4629
You seem to have taken quite an interest in my wardrobe decisions.
4629
Are all trolls so fashion-minded?
4629
Maybe later.
4629
Well, we already know there won't be.
4629
That's nothing new.
4629
Wow, what?
4630
The outcome will happen one way or another.
4630
Whether you have something to do with it or not.
4630
You might as well ask me.
4630
At least when it happens, you'll understand what it is that's happening.
4630
And just maybe, if we're really lucky, so will I.
4630
I have a question for you too.
4630
Let's swap ignorance, ok?
4630
When?
4630
I have no idea.
4630
I can't see the future.
4630
I'm a disreputable Derse Dreamer, remember?
4630
But I promise that if I have a hand in it, it won't be because you told me.
4630
Does that make you feel better?
4630
Is that why you want to dissuade me from my admittedly zealous investigation to go play dress-up again?
4630
Because our time here is almost up?
4630
And you hope what's on the other side of the dark curtain for me is not some sort of corruption or damnation?
4630
That's thoughtful of you.
4630
To strive to pacify me as I scuffle down this black corridor.
4630
Is it?
4630
Oh.
4630
That's a pity.
4630
Who will make sure my soul isn't forfeit in service of gods then?
4630
What do you mean, "again?"
4630
One simple word can so easily begin a story in a very thick book.
4630
But I guess we won't open this one?
4630
Yes.
4630
I was wondering.
4631
What do you know about the ?
4631
Thank you.
4631
The transaction was very tidy.
4705
?
4705
Why do you keep addressing me as if I'm some sort of spokesperson for the reality of magic?
4705
You can't needle me into a defensive posture on the subject. I just don't care.
4705
Fine. You win.
4705
These are science wands. I am a charlatan.
4705
Thanks for the insinuation that I'm making an effort to project myself as a cartoon villain. What a compliment!
4705
Nobility? What are you talking about?
4705
No. What gave you that idea?
4705
That is exactly what happened. You figured it out.
4705
...
4705
You're a complete idiot.
4705
What?
4705
And how was that?
4705
Accidentally?
4705
Or on porpoise?
4705
Oh, right. Alien romance, I forgot.
4705
Pass.
4705
That's really sweet of you to offer.
4705
You want to learn magic?
4705
Sure. Let's begin.
4705
Consider this your first lesson in showmanship.
4708
Hi.
4708
Do you want me to stop using magic too?
4708
?
4708
Who?
4708
You sound frustrated.
4708
Like you know you can't change my mind.
4708
I presume your future footage of me has already verified this?
4708
You died?
4708
Revived via dream self, I take it?
4708
Hmm.
4708
What did they tell you?
4708
Is that anything like the ultimate riddle?
4709
Do you know about it?
4709
The sun?
4709
That isn't exactly my plan.
4709
How do you know that?
4709
Could you please share your information with me?
4709
Well,
4709
Aren't you doing that regardless? Right now?
4709
O_O
4709
You have circuitry?
4709
Wait, don't go!
4709
You were actually interesting.
4712
Yes?
4712
Why, what ever could you want?
4712
What could it be? I am completely confounded.
4712
Is what?
4712
Who?
4712
What is the name of this mystery fellow you seek?
4712
It's ok. I understand.
4712
I think I have a more permanent solution.
4712
I mean purrmanent.
4716
Hi Jaspers.
4716
Jaspers, I am releasing you now.
4716
You are free to go do as you please.
4716
Not yet, Jaspers.
4716
It's a little complicated, but I believe I've embarked on another quest, one which surpasses the scope of the objectives local to this planet.
4716
I'm saying there's something more important to accomplish now. Something more important than creating a universe.
4716
Why?
4716
I see. I promise I will consider it seriously then.
4716
Thanks, Jaspers, that's nice to hear.
4716
It's hard to remember, but I'm pretty sure I felt the same way back then.
4716
See you, Jaspers!
4716
If you see my mother in the course of your travels, tell her I said hello.
4804
Did you know your planet was on fire?
4804
Yes. It makes a good light for reading, actually.
4804
Yes, I do seem to be shadowed by each mystery and its somber cortege of riddles, don't I?
4804
First of all, I should preface this conversation by saying I know exactly what you and Jade are going to do.
4804
The more of our future I've been allowed to see, the more I'm presented with a challenge I'm not very comfortable with.
4804
The trolls have tipped us off about what's to come without any regard for the consequences, as appears to be their nature.
4804
But maybe that's why it's worked for them.
4804
Maybe their indiscretion mingles with the cosmic noise that is the fabric of temporal uncertainty.
4804
Sorry, John.
4804
I'm just nervous about it.
4804
About whether telling you what you definitely will or won't do will alter a predetermined outcome.
4804
The result would be a splintered timeline, and we would all be sentenced to eventual oblivion.
4804
I'm presently optimistic this has not happened yet, and this is still the alpha timeline. I'd like to keep it that way.
4804
Yes, sort of.
4804
It isn't much fun, John.
4804
Living for months in an offshoot reality, waiting for the curtain to drop.
4804
Hmm.
4804
I guess I can permit myself to tell you this, somewhat definitively.
4804
Failing to prototype the kernel is the absolute worst thing that you could possibly do.
4804
Like, ever.
4804
We would come into possession of all the disasters.
4804
Exhaustive possession. Monopolization, in fact.
4804
Because the battlefield will not be able to heal, and then transform.
4804
It will not reach the stage which allows it to become ready to receive our universe.
4804
Yes.
4804
Because if it does not reach this stage, we will not be able to recover the treasure hidden in its core.
4804
Which is to say,
4804
You will not be able to recover it.
4804
When you go to sleep again.
4804
Yes. This is the treasure that will give us hope.
4804
But only if it comes into being in the first place.
4804
John, what is that sound?
4804
It seems to be a ticking noise.
4821
John.
4821
You were sleeping.
4821
Why were you sleeping?
4821
Everywhere I look, I see boys taking naps.
4821
You weren't.
4821
Ten minutes, I'd say.
4821
What were you dreaming about?
4821
I wouldn't imagine so.
4821
A black guy?
4821
Thanks for clearing that up.
4821
She's fine.
4821
But you're not.
4821
Remember how I said your planet was on fire?
4821
It did not.
4821
Do you see that pinkish hue behind you, bleeding over the horizon?
4821
I don't think the fire's rate of propagation is quite as fast as you're imagining.
4821
But the danger is still significant.
4821
Especially considering that your bed is sinking.
4821
Relax.
4821
Look to your right.
4822
This will at least buy you some time.
4822
If you stay calm, and we work together, we can get you out of this.
4822
I'm practically an expert at escaping fires by now.
4822
Yes.
4822
I have a crystal ball.
4822
Yes.
4822
I think so.
4822
No, it can only show me various locations in the present moment, as far as I can tell.
4822
My perception of the future has been informed by other sources.
4822
Informants.
4822
Whispering gods, memories sifted from dreams, cryptic readings from unearthed talismans, conclusions drawn from riddles deciphered - every gambit you'd expect a quest to extend to an emerging seer.
4822
Just as I presume an heir would be supplied with what's needed for his maturation, assuming he's looking for it.
4822
You should probably be doing what you're doing.
4822
I didn't know why you were asleep, did I?
4822
I have more pedestrian sources too, you know.
4822
Sometimes trolls blither tidbits about the future, and I can't help but take note of it.
4822
Just as they do with you.
4822
You also have access to the oracle clouds in Skaia, whereas I do not.
4822
Knowing the future is no remarkable feat here.
4822
It appears to be a fact of life.
4822
I'm not all that special, John.
4822
Really?
4822
I'm not actually trying to caricaturize a grim sorcerer.
4822
There's still a perfectly intact piece of my mind which realizes how ridiculous it is to be flying across rainbow oceans with a couple of magic wands and a salamander in a little cowl.
4822
And it wasn't without swallowing a little embarrassment that I revealed I was using a crystal ball just now.
4822
It's all pretty absurd.
4822
And yet,
4822
It's been fun, and above all, practical.
4822
For solving our problems.
4822
I still read books and tell jokes.
4822
John,
4822
That was mean.
4823
Swoon!
4823
I will do by best to occupy myself as benignly and unmagically as possible until you show up.
4823
... "Happy?"
4823
What is this strange, unsad emotion of which you speak?
4823
Jokes?
4823
Are those the things people say when they want unusual noises to come out of the pliable crescent-shaped holes sometimes found in people's faces?
4823
I need to make a note of this.
4823
Excuse me while I open this tome bound in the tanned, writhing flesh of a tortured hellscholar. The screaming will subside shortly.
4823
Continue to not be alarmed as I record your advice with runes stroked in the black tears bled from the corruption-weary eyes of fifty thousand imaginary occultists.
4823
And then brace yourself for the fabled blackdeath trance of the woegothics I will slip into, while quaking in the bloodeldritch throes of the broodfester tongues.
4823
One is not easily shaken from the broodfester tongues, John.
4823
They are stubborn throes.
4823
Besides, you can't come to my planet right away.
4823
You will need to recover the treasure first, because it must be delivered to me.
4823
You'd probably be disappointed if I described it.
4823
Ok.
4823
It's called The Tumor.
4824
Sorry.
4824
I was preoccupied.
4824
Oh, let's say,
4824
Troll stuff.
4824
You know how it is.
4824
Incidentally, looks like you will have your own troll stuff to attend to shortly.
4824
Yes.
4824
Involving the one who hates you, and the one who likes you.
4824
You don't have a guess?
4824
I have to go, John.
4824
Talk to your trolls.
4824
We'll catch up shortly.
4936
Hi there.
4936
Don't mind me.
4936
I'm just waiting for that guy on the pile of sharp objects to wake up.
4936
If you don't stop nakking, I will turn you into a thorn bush.
4937
You fell asleep.
4937
Orange Bird Dave killed some monsters and flew away.
4937
Jade fired a bullet at an imp and vanished.
4937
And you woke up.
4937
Yes.
4937
Yes, she's fine.
4937
You already are.
4937
Future you is.
4937
How was the nap?
4937
It's ok.
4937
I was being similarly wake duplicitous.
4937
No, my books are great.
4937
I can recommend some good titles for the next time you're asleep.
4937
Did you do anything on the moon besides rifle through my belongings?
4937
Such as remove your shades and turn your gaze Ringward, by any chance?
4937
What did you see?
4937
Horribleterrible?
4937
What were they saying?
4937
?
4939
That's good.
4939
It means they're reaching out to you.
4939
You're going to have to help them.
4939
Even if you don't like them.
4939
They're being massacred.
4939
Presently, already, and still to come.
4939
It means time doesn't work rationally out there.
4939
Nor does space.
4939
But that doesn't change the reality of the threat.
4939
You're underestimating the nature of the threat.
4939
At this point, the threat isn't to our session, or any given universe.
4939
It's to the perpetuation of reality itself.
4939
You wouldn't be saving them, per se.
4939
You'd be saving everything.
4940
They've revealed some of their secrets to me already, and given me a few errands to run.
4940
This is why you might have observed some unusual behavior from me.
4940
Once these convulsions of explosive laughter subside and finish rocking my very foundation,
4940
I might point out that you haven't really been as astute as you're implying.
4940
You've deliberately fogged your vision your entire life with ironic eyewear while awake, and while asleep, though perfectly alert, you've chosen to ignore your surroundings.
4940
But now that you've seen them, you have a choice to make.
4940
They will only tell me so much.
4940
They would like an audience with the prince of the moon as well.
4940
We are like the emissaries to what lies beyond this small bubble in their unfathomable dark foam.
4940
Derse skirts its edge, and during the lunar eclipse, we graze it, and that's when their intent for us becomes clear.
4940
I'm doing my part, but they have a mission for you as well.
4940
Listen to them.
4940
My understanding is,
4940
They will teach you how to navigate the unnavigable.
4940
The result should be a map.
4940
No.
4940
Something a little more astronomical.
4940
Like a star chart with no stars.
4940
Hence the challenge.
4940
To plot a course through the Furthest Ring.
4941
The power source of the first guardians.
4941
Yes, that's much better.
4941
What's the deal with it?
4941
I don't know that there is a deal with it.
4941
Beyond the deal you just described.
4941
It is what it sounds like.
4941
A huge sun out in the literal middle of nowhere, and it is bright green.
4941
It is simply,
4941
The .
4941
It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.
4941
Happy I could help.
4941
Yes.
4941
No.
4941
The geometry of the Furthest Ring is too complex.
4941
Remember, its spacetime is labyrinthine.
4941
In fact, it's not really accurate to call it spacetime at all.
4941
Since it is outside the domain of any created universe, where those properties have become instantiated and stabilized.
4941
It depends.
4941
The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.
4941
And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.
4941
Time and space aren't as different as you might think.
4941
I think it means I'm supposed to know shit about the big picture.
4941
Which includes tidbits like that.
4941
But the insides of my shoes stay free from the grit of the minutia.
4941
No, I do.
4941
That depends on if John is successful.
4942
Yes.
4942
Nothing whatsoever.
4942
Yes, The Tumor.
4942
I guess so.
4942
I thought it was more fun that way.
4942
Thanks.
4942
<black>The Tumor</black> is quite a large growth at the center of the battlefield.
4942
He won't be able to remove it without fully realizing his abilities.
4942
Can you promise you won't tell him?
4942
It would probably make him more nervous than he needs to be if he knew.
4942
It's a bomb.
4943
It is set to detonate precisely when the reckoning ends.
4943
This is how long we have to put this plan into motion.
4943
It could be a feature of any session not meant to bear fruit.
4943
A means to wipe out a null session rather than leaving it lingering in paradox space for eternity.
4943
Or it could be a mutation specific to our session.
4943
I really don't know.
4943
Not exactly.
4943
They've urged me in certain directions and guided my exploration.
4943
I've obtained some answers from them, but ultimately, this idea is mine.
4943
Plus, I have other sources.
4943
One in particular has been quite illuminating.
4943
I've been referring to him as an informant, when people ask.
4943
Which isn't often.
4943
No.
4943
It's a man who exists in another universe.
4943
He wants to die.
4943
Only as credible as the omniscient tend to be.
4943
Yeah, I think that's what omniscient means.
4943
But maybe I'll ask him about that, since he's the omniscient one.
4943
He says he doesn't lie.
4943
For some reason, I believe him about that.
4943
He's a convincing fellow.
4943
He no longer has a purpose now that he's done everything required to summon his master.
4943
As a first guardian, he's completely indestructible.
4943
Well, almost completely.
4943
His power is derived from the same source as Earth's guardian.
4943
And conveniently, that of our nemesis as well.
4943
When John delivers the tumor,
4943
And I do mean The Tumor,
4943
I and I alone will navigate the Furthest Ring.
4943
And I will destroy the sun.
4943
By which I do mean the .
4943
And in case it wasn't clear,
4943
I won't be coming back.
4944
Let's not be so dramatic.
4944
I was talking about my dream self.
4944
She's the one who won't be returning.
4944
That's true.
4944
Your outburst was pretty sweet though.
4944
If there's one thing you have more than any of us, it's time.
4944
So, whenever you like.
4944
As long as conventionally speaking, it's quite soon.
4944
Sure.
4944
And if you have trouble going to sleep, maybe you can ask your patron troll to trick the telepathic one into putting you to sleep again.
4944
Each of us seems to have a troll infatuated with helping us. Haven't you noticed?
4944
What about the psychopath who's currently helping you?
4944
Isn't that camaraderie blossoming into some sort of interspecies whatever?
4944
Just now.
4944
That would be John's patron troll.
4944
There's a juggalo one?
4944
She's contacting me now actually.
4944
Thanks.
4945
I explained this.
4945
The intent isn't true self sacrifice.
4945
Are you sure it's not because I'm sleeping?
4945
Shh...
4945
Blah blah blah!
4945
You're right, I can't explain why I go dark on your monitor.
4945
But I'm confident in my plan. I have it under control.
4945
Maybe it did?
4945
Maybe that's what went wrong.
4945
We figured it out!
4945
Oh?
4945
I'm sorry to hear that, Kanaya.
4945
What did you have in mind for this new and exciting adversarial phase of our relationship?
4945
!
4946
Is it too late to throw myself at your mercy?
4947
I see.
4947
Then clearly I will have to prepare for this soul sundering duel, whilst making my own funeral arrangements.
4947
What will herald the arrival of this swift and righteous thaumaturge?
4947
Will I be blinded by the fearsome lashes of light ribboning from the incandescent coastline of his beauteous aura?
4947
Should I borrow my friend's sunglasses?
4947
Yeah.
4947
I was getting that.
4947
You don't always have to tip your hand, Kanaya. You were doing well.
4947
Mm-hm.
4947
We take it very seriously.
4947
Wait, you did? Really?
4947
That's incredible. Well done.
4947
Oh, I knew exactly who you were talking about from the start.
4947
I must say, this little project pleases me.
4947
Do keep me apprised of all further developments.
4947
At least until my looming grimdarkdeath steals me away.
5527
It's quite warm here on Lohac.
5527
I think I've been patient enough.
5527
When will I receive further instruction?
5527
So,
5527
I could have contacted you at any time?
5527
I came away with the impression from our last conversation that our next would take place on your invitation.
5527
I was being polite by waiting.
5527
That's pretty smug.
5527
Well,
5527
Two out of three isn't bad.
5527
Can you use your limitless intelligence to figure out which ones I mean?
5527
This is stupid.
5527
Could we get to the point?
5527
You have a visitor?
5527
Who?
5527
You tell jokes?
5527
So, your visitor isn't setting anything on fire then?
5527
I'm really not getting this joke.
5527
I thought you didn't lie.
5527
Aren't jokes essentially humorous lies?
5527
At least, those like the one you just attempted.
5527
I think if you're going to risk tarnishing your record of honesty, you should probably get better material.
5527
Ok.
5527
So you're saying an inaccurate statement doesn't count as a lie, as long as you say "just kidding" later?
5527
What if it's much later? Is it still "just a joke?"
5527
Are you allowed to lie about playing pranks? If I asked you if you were playing a prank on me, would you tell the truth?
5527
I'm starting to change my mind.
5527
Yes. I think your joke was funny in retrospect. Actually, your whole shtick is pretty good. I'm warming up to it.
5527
Just to be clear,
5527
Was the assurance you just made a prank or a joke?
5527
Was that?
5527
The truth?
5527
Ok.
5527
Were you serious about wanting to die?
5527
Why?
5527
Why?
5527
But why not now?
5527
Then you know how this entire conversation will go?
5527
Is that true of all conversations you have?
5527
Then why do you bother with the conversations? Obligation to predestination, as usual?
5527
It is?
5527
Hmm.
5527
That's a little creepy.
5527
Yes it is.
5527
It kind of is.
5527
That doesn't make sense.
5527
Was that the other joke?
5527
Heh. Good one.
5527
How young are the ladies you typically take a shining to?
5527
And does this mean you are attracted to me?
5527
Suddenly this conversation is kind of terrible.
5527
...
5527
Really.
5527
Oh my god.
5527
Can we talk about the scratch instead of this?
5528
Are you actually asking?
5528
Ah.
5528
Well, yes, I am.
5528
It's a large plateau shaped like a record. It's called the Beat Mesa.
5528
Is the game construct different in other sessions?
5528
You mean, in sessions where victory is no longer possible?
5528
Due to creating an unstoppable adversary? Who triggers the reckoning prematurely?
5528
Is that sort of emergency common?
5528
Ok.
5528
Then, it's like a panic button for the players to push once they realize the cause is lost.
5528
Who?
5528
Dave's bro?
5528
How do I finish it?
5528
Oh, right.
5528
The Green...
5528
Wait.
5528
The .
5528
I'd planned to take care of that later, once John had retrieved the Tumor.
5528
Whatever.
5528
What will the one who does it have to do? I should let them know.
5528
I see.
5528
This terminology can be very literal sometimes.
5528
I have needles.
5528
Then where do I get ones that will?
5528
This really seems more elaborate than you lead me to believe.
5528
I wish what I'd written in my private journals could be confined to your dark spots.
5528
You're being creepy again.
5528
What?
5528
Just,
5528
Please stop complimenting me.
5529
Fine.
5529
Then please at least try to sound more sarcastic when you do it.
5529
...
5529
Then the Scratch will be implemented later, by either John or Dave I presume?
5529
You used a male pronoun.
5529
I guess it makes sense that it would happen later. My understanding is that Jack will not be banished from this session until near the end of the reckoning.
5529
I don't understand.
5529
I thought that was the point of the Scratch, to open a rift in spacetime as it were, and banish him into the trolls' session.
5529
Hmm.
5529
Then why have you directed me to cause it?
5529
Does it have something to do with enabling you to die?
5529
I think it's disingenuous for you to behave as if I have not been misled.
5529
You say you don't lie, but what about lies of omission?
5529
Unless you're joking.
5529
Haa haa, hee hee, hoo hoo?
5529
Then I guess I'll start asking better questions.
5529
Will you?
5529
Ok. Noted.
5529
What exactly does the Scratch do, then?
5529
Oh.
5529
That's it?
5529
Then,
5529
We all start from the beginning again? When John entered?
5529
What will happen to us? Everyone in this session now?
5529
This seems familiar.
5529
It reminds me of when Dave and I were trapped in the doomed timeline, and he left to change the past.
5529
The timeline ceased to exist, along with my dream self, who in a way became merged with my dream self of this timeline. I kept some of her memories.
5529
Is the situation similar?
5530
Then can you at least tell me if we will be successful in preserving ourselves after the reset?
5530
So if the Scratch isn't specifically meant to banish Jack from the session,
5530
And our quest to destroy the sun is meant to kill him,
5530
Why is the reset necessary at all, especially if it means oblivion for us?
5530
I guess.
5530
But it's a little disheartening to learn I'm now faced with not one, but two suicide missions at once.
5530
One to destroy Jack's power source and defend all of existence, and another to ensure our cosmic progeny at the price of oblivion.
5530
Immortality?
5530
Do you mean ascending to the god tier?
5530
I have reason to believe that I won't.
5530
The trolls have not indicated I will die on my Quest Bed, or that any of us will aside from John. Instead I've been given a more troubling and ambiguous forecast.
5530
Are you saying I will?
5530
Oh.
5530
Well, will I?
5530
Fine.
5530
Maybe this question will suit you better.
5530
Is it probable?
5530
Then what's your answer?
5530
That's a strange answer.
5530
Why such a precise probability?
5530
Two ways?
5530
By dying on the Quest Bed on my planet, and some other way?
5530
Is there another Quest Bed somewhere?
5530
Where?
5530
That's true.
5530
You mentioned immortality.
5530
Godhood makes one immortal?
5530
A god tier will live forever, with no caveats?
5530
How are those terms defined?
5530
Which sort of death will you have when I destroy the sun?
5530
Is this when you are going to tell me why you want to die?
5530
I sense it's not just because you're getting bored with immortality.
5530
Then why?
5530
That almost sounds like martyrdom. Are you sure it won't be a hero's death?
5530
Who is he?
5531
This doesn't sound like an especially admirable objective. Releasing an evil man, who is presumably more powerful than you, an already omnipotent being.
5531
Am I right?
5531
But in the process of killing him and you, I release your master, who is just as deadly?
5531
Then I guess I don't have a choice.
5531
Are you saying that I will succeed in the mission to destroy the sun?
5531
...
5531
I'm just trying to ask as many questions as I can. It's the only way to find the dark spots in your obstinacy.
5531
Can you?
5531
Your seeds?
5531
Oh. The cue ball. How did I not notice this?
5531
Hmm.
5531
Is that possible?
5532
How can I see through it?
5532
Yes, if you wanted to be disingenuous and irritating.
5532
Then it's a challenge!
5532
I pass.
5532
Ok, so what you mean is I should continue humoring your leading questions until you happen to ask certain rhetorical questions that contain information I need.
5532
That was a fact, and then a period.
5532
...
5532
With a crystal ball?
5532
I already considered that. I don't think I can get the focus of the ball to "zoom in" tight enough on the cue ball's enclosure to read the answers.
5532
By other magical means, I guess.
5532
Should I use magic?
5532
Magic is real.
5532
I've been using it.
5532
Use whatever word you want to describe it. I have magic wands, they are very powerful, and they allow me to be magic. Your questions are silly.
5532
Because I did not have the abilities before I made them.
5532
Could it?
5532
Is there an echo?
5532
I don't know what you're getting at.
5532
How about another leading question?
5532
Some stuff.
5532
I'm guessing this is one of the rhetorical questions meant to be informative.
5532
So then, my answer should affirm how ridiculous that sounds, shouldn't it?
5532
That wasn't even a question.
5532
Ok. Magic is fake, the wands are useless toys, and there is something else going on. Next question???
5532
What would I say to those short fables?
5532
Not much, except I gather the third is a story about me, and that there's a lesson you'd like me to take from it.
5532
That I should renounce my "allegiance" before my grimdark corruption is absolute.
5532
And while I'm at it, I should discard these useless wands, because apparently the power was in my little black heart all along. Is that right?
5532
I don't know! If you say so.
5532
Yes. It has been mysteriously localized to my middle finger. Could the dark magics be at work AGAIN?!
5532
Friendship isn't an emotion, numbnuts.
5532
I've been busy. I'll get back to them.
5532
And can we please stop doing the patronizing question thing?
5532
In exchange I promise I will discontinue my patronizing responses.
5532
The omniscipotent can do whatever they please. I guess I'm just asking you nicely to do me this favor.
5532
Huh?
5532
So creepy.
5532
Yuck.
5532
Ok.
5532
I don't know.
5532
With her eyes?
5532
I don't know what to ask anymore.
5532
I'm confused.
5532
I would ask what should I do next.
5532
What should I do next?
5536
Sorry for the delayed response.
5536
Answering seems to be what to do right now.
5536
Oh, right. I forgot I gave you the code for the crystal ball.
5536
And here I was thinking I could safely delay responding to messages without seeming like an ass, the way it usually works.
5536
Oops.
5536
Why would I be upset?
5536
Know what?
5538
I should have gone looking for her.
5538
Why didn't I?
5538
John was too. But he went to look for his father.
5538
It would have been normal of me. I can't remember what I was trying to prove anymore.
5538
You're doing fine.
5538
For someone raised by a dog.
5538
Or really,
5538
Anyone.
5538
Thanks.
5538
For some reason, despite all the danger, I never thought she was in any trouble.
5538
I never believed she would actually die.
5538
I grew up with the feeling that something more significant had always been meant for her.
5538
That she was a heroine displaced in some way, resigned to the inglorious duty of raising me, and preparing me in her way.
5538
I didn't actually need the ectobiological verification that she was like a mother and a sister at the same time. I always understood that somehow.
5538
And I felt she had knowledge and ability beyond what she let on. It was always intimidating, but nonetheless a source of respect which was childishly begrudging on my part.
5538
I think she was just waiting for me to catch up with her.
5538
But now I can't.
5538
Probably because my emotions have now ceded to anger.
5538
This shouldn't have happened.
5538
I already was.
5538
I was going to go to sleep, fly to a sun bigger than our universe, drop a bomb in it, and kill myself.
5538
So if my course of action is to change on account of my mood, it can only become less impetuous, don't you think?
5538
You never liked my plan very much anyway.
5538
I'm not sure if I did.
5538
Maybe it was a terrible plan.
5538
I made it without a full understanding of the nature of the Scratch.
5538
I could stop being so cowardly, for once.
5538
I could short circuit this endlessly expanding game of chess we're playing, just like Jack decided to do.
5538
Maybe I will go kill Jack myself.
5538
Right now.
5538
Probably.
5538
But the Scratch will wipe us out anyway, and reboot the conditions of our session.
5538
I suddenly don't feel much like sneaking through the back door of the Furthest Ring for retribution by distant super nova.
5538
Whether my existing plan was sensible or not,
5538
I may have been allowing myself to be manipulated by an omniscient being regardless.
5538
This is a private conversation.
5538
Private even to those who know it word for word already.
5538
Ignore him.
5538
Shh.
5538
Anyway, if it's true the gods have "selected" me for service, maybe the power they've given me will be sufficient.
5538
Maybe they wanted me to kill him all along.
5538
But I am.
5538
I'm fully aware I'll probably die and fail. Scratch happens, we start fresh. No recollection, no problem.
5538
They are enormous, ugly, and live in darkness.
5538
That doesn't necessarily make them bad.
5538
The cue ball.
5538
Yes. And he is right.
5538
It advised me to talk to you just now.
5538
So I guess so.
5538
What are you suggesting I ask it?
5538
So, you're saying I should ask it if the gods are evil?
5764
vriska, wait!
5764
oops, hold on.
5776
For what?
5777
You mean a canard of behemothic embellishment?
5777
Or was your resolve finally dismantled by the siren's song of all that flame broiled beef?
5777
I'll limit my establishments of reference to lumber mills and sugar shanties from now on.
5777
Also, there's a Burger King less than forty minutes from my house. I won't let this stand in the way of the new policy though.
5777
Certainly less delicious.
5777
Yes.
5778
I thought you didn't want me to analyze your dreams anymore.
5778
Maybe we can start by evaluating that troubling metaphor.
5778
We've already established that all of your dreams are packed with enough homoerotic symbolism to lift Freudian theory from the ashes of discreditation.
5778
Are you serious?
5778
I'm clearing my schedule. This is a major breakthrough.
5779
Go on.
5779
It's ok.
5779
They wouldn't be cliches if they didn't comprise the unanimously understood bedrock of phallic symbolism, with no other viable interpretation.
5779
Hm.
5779
Well, if I've learned anything from my extensive skimming over the Wikipedia articles on dream analysis,
5779
It's that this dream is very unlikely to have any literal significance whatsoever.
5779
It's probably not about dying at all.
5779
Yes. In fact, if you were on my couch that would have been my next question, as a licensed professional.
5779
"Mr. Strider, have you considered that what you actually dread is to have your urban rhythms exposed for what they truly are, which is, clinically speaking, just shy of 'da bomb'?"
5779
Listening to you conjure imagery of my mother in her underpants is definitely keeping us buoyed high above this swirling Freudian hellhole.
5779
Well done.
5779
What if you're wrong?
5779
Her not being your mother.
5779
Don't worry, you're probably safe. Luckily I can think of no literary or historical precedent for that sort of folly whatsoever.
5779
Isn't it?
5779
Why don't you tell me more about your dream?
5779
That's interesting.
5779
I've read about this.
5779
Certain texts say singing from the unknowable void carries a message.
5779
That its recipient has been selected for a mission of supreme cosmic importance, that will result in your death and that of billions more.
5779
But one that is essential to the perpetuation of existence itself.
5779
It's not from a psychology text.
5779
Not astrology.
5779
More like,
5779
Zoology.
5779
Ok.
5779
Keep describing the dream, though.
5779
If the rest of it is incompatible with prognoses of the zoologically dubious, I will withdraw my insinuation.
5779
This doesn't strike you as an impulse of self destruction?
5779
So, if hypothetically you were to accept such a mission, or even insist upon one, it wouldn't be in the spirit of genuine sacrifice, but of escape?
5779
Aw. We were making good progress, too.
5779
Why did you have to go and remember?
5780
What do you think?
5780
If you're starting to remember, you should be able to tell me.
5780
Maybe I'm just as confused as you about it?
5780
Am I dead or asleep, Dave?
5780
Try to remember.
5796
Yes.
5796
What else?
5796
She's around.
5796
Her name is Liv Tyler.
5796
Take it up with John.
5796
What else?
5796
Do you remember what we decided?
5796
Not quite.
5796
Do you remember anything else?
5796
What about why you went to fight Jack?
5796
Are you sure?
5796
So was your decision a result of desire or obligation?
5796
I don't know much about the Light Shit, to be honest.
5796
I may have missed my chance to figure it out.
5796
Mostly.
5796
I'm doing what I can to jog your memory.
5796
Nice.
5796
So what about Jade?
5796
You didn't tell her your expedition with her would result in your death, let alone one she'd inadvertently cause.
5796
Or that she'd be stuck with the job of resuscitating you. Did you?
5796
Not if you're "supposed to," right?
5796
I guess you're right. No reason to make an effort to empathize if doing so comes at the price of oblivion.
5796
It must be comforting to have your ASPD tacitly supported by predestination.
5796
Antisocial personality disorder.
5796
It wasn't already awful, believing you might be dead?
5796
So it's a disorder, a complex, and then a disorder again for good measure?
5796
Sounds like a positively delirious state of existence.
5796
Oh... snap?
5796
Might you loosen the purse strings on an "Oh no he didn't?"
5796
I guess I'm learning to be impressed by your sense of obligation to inevitable misfortune. It's a strange case of inspiration through futility.
5796
With what, exactly?
5796
Hey!
5796
These really do not sound like the words of someone ready to face his own death.
5796
The kind you don't wake up from, I mean.
5796
The unseen bitches callously conspiring to expect greatness from you?
5796
If that's how you feel,
5796
Then why did you insist on going on the mission to deliver The Tumor?
5796
Black-and-whitened for giant yin-yang bomb.
5797
Are you sure?
5797
Maybe you should try to answer the question. Why did you want to go?
5797
But it seems simple enough. A set of bearings to follow.
5797
See? The application pilots the moon. Change course when necessary. Anyone can do it, really.
5797
We talked about this. Debated, if you recall.
5797
I'm just seeing if you can remember. And if you're sticking to your story, about why you should be the one to go.
5797
You're almost there, really. Just try to remember a little more.
5797
What happened after we decided you'd go?
5800
Mm hm.
5801
Careful.
5801
I just managed to quell my appetite after all that burger talk.
5804
I really am sorry for that.
5804
If it's any consolation, Liv Tyler came with me on the suicide mission.
5804
Which would make you feel better?
5804
If I could have chosen a method of sparing your life you might have found more awesome, I would.
5804
Is there an "ironic" way to do that?
5804
Does it matter if I took some personal satisfaction seeing you fall unconscious at the gentle glance of a soft cotton globe?
5804
...
5804
Yes to the first part.
5804
Not yet.
5804
Afraid not!
5804
I am wide awake.
5837
I am piloting the moon through the Furthest Ring right now.
5837
At the moment, it's passing through a dream bubble. I am visiting your dream in person.
5837
Or, you are the one visiting me as I travel, in your sleep. If you'd rather look at it that way.
5837
Not entirely.
5837
Why?
5837
I'm already out here. Might as well go through with it.
5837
A major league wind up?
5837
It's always been pretty sad that I seem to know more about sports than you. Which is really saying something.
5837
It's probably just "ball hog."
5837
Oh lord.
5837
The last thing I want to do is come between a big man's thunder and any particular hole he might prize.
5837
That's not even close to being a thing in football.
5837
Which prize is that?
5837
You mean the most vaunted accolade associated with the gridiron, known as "Stanley's Cup?"
5837
I'll take your word for it.
5837
How high do they even have to be?
5837
Does the officiator have a means of measurement on hand?
5837
I wouldn't want to be crushed by a nonregulation sport pile.
5837
Poser?
5837
So not cool.
5837
I forget what we were doing exactly.
5837
Were we pursuing the hackneyed debate over who has the best claim to self sacrifice,
5837
Or seeing who can out-dumbass the other with obtuse sports lingo?
5837
I'm the one stalling?
5837
The moon is probably just a speck in the sky now due to your strange beefcake harangue.
5837
I guess I could wake back you up, if you really want.
5838
But you have to promise to stay put.
5838
Don't try to stop me. Just let it go.
5838
It really makes no sense for you to go. This was never your preoccupation.
5838
They selected me a long time ago.
5838
Yes, they helped you chart a path through the Ring. And they will open that path for a pilot they have marked.
5838
I believe I fit the description. I'm not sure about you.
5838
I am the pilot. That's all there is to say on the matter.
5838
Help John and Jade.
5838
Then I'm not going to help you wake you up.
5838
I'll stall some more.
5838
I said not entirely.
5838
It's going to be a long ride through all this nothingness.
5838
Maybe I just thought some company would be nice.
5838
Before it's all over.
5838
So what'll it be?
5838
I'll wake you, but only if you promise to rejoin the others.
5838
Could you give a message to John for me?
5838
Aw, are you sure?
5838
I was looking forward to bowling another wicked googly with the yarn.
5838
Sportsways.
5838
Ok.
5838
What was that?
5838
Did you hear something?
5838
I thought I heard something outside.
5839
You don't remember him?
5839
Then I guess this isn't a memory.
5839
Not with us.
5839
Just me.
5839
You're still on Derse, remember?
6249
Corpse party?
6249
Of course.
6249
I would describe it as an occasion marked by a great deal of jubilation at the expense of one or more well dressed cadavers.
6249
Well, in my experience, a loved one, typically an elder, arranges to have the departed placed in a small box, and then forces you to stand in the rain all day.
6249
Then, presumably winded by all the deeply ironic catharsis, she gets drunk and passes out on the couch.
6249
I'm going to agree with my fellow seer on this.
6250
It shouldn't be a problem.
6250
It's simple.
6250
We regroup, and then defeat him in person.
6254
Yes.
6254
Illumination of the road to victory for all is an asset considerably different from command over the outcomes of decisions made by individuals.
6254
How do you know your talents won't be critical in blazing this auspicious trail?
6254
That's because you're not me.
6255
Nothing yet.
6255
But reasonably soon, within a certain window, it will be time to leave.
6255
We will then pilot this meteor as fast as we can make it go in that exact direction.
6255
Nothing whatsoever.
6255
As of now, that way lies darkness and uncertainty beyond description.
6255
Trust me, it is.
6255
Just as you should trust me that by the time we leave, if we leave exactly within the designated window and are able to travel at nearly the speed of light, the meteor will trace a route through the Furthest Ring which will topologically resolve as a straight line.
6255
It will lead us directly to the new session.
6255
For a brief moment, the sun will be visible from that session.
6255
And we will be riding the chartreuse coattails of its photons.
6255
That's because it's almost impossible to do so voluntarily.
6255
If we were to head right now in the session's true physical direction, it wouldn't be long before we found ourselves traveling in just the opposite direction.
6255
This is not even to speak of the chronological peculiarities. After traveling some distance, we could discover we were suddenly tailgating our own meteor from several days ago.
6255
If we are particularly unfortunate, we might even collide in an intersection of spacetime with a meteor piloted by our future selves.
6255
And if we looked closely at that meteor before impact, we might notice a very large dent in it, which it originally suffered during the very collision we were about to experience.
6255
It takes precision and timing to reach your destination out here, and most importantly, the grace of the gods themselves.
6255
Hm?
6255
Yes.
6255
Yes.
6255
Don't be ridiculous. It won't take nearly that long.
6255
It'll only take about three years.
6255
Yes, two.
6255
And then fifty more.
6256
Why?
6256
But what if we need your help?
6256
It's hard to say.
6256
Does the repopulation of your species qualify as victory?
6256
These things aren't always clear cut. Some outcomes are for your own judgment.
6256
What outcome would you like the most?
6256
Ok.
6256
If you follow my advice, I can at least promise you will find yourself in the best position to determine whether that may come to pass.
6256
Can you please come?
6256
Between the two of us, you with your inexplicably heretofore unmentioned phosphorescence, and I with my nigh-reflective traffic cone orange sun-sari, the meteor should never be too dark.
6256
It's soon or never. But not immediately.
6256
Even if the route were accessible right now, it would still behoove us to wait.
6256
There's correspondence from John yet to arrive.
6256
And after that, we have to wait for one final guest to appear.
6256
Then we ride like the solar wind. The race will be afoot.
6256
Oh lord.
6256
Now what?
6257
Was that the one you mentioned had a pink heart on it?
6257
Hmm.
6257
It's just that with the clarity afforded by my new abilities, it occurred to me just now that dead horse was likely the beautiful pet pony my mother gave me recently.
6257
It was crushed to death by your newborn ass.
6257
You bastard.
6257
Thanks.
6259
...
6283
The visitor I mentioned earlier.
6283
He will be traveling with us too.
6284
We should be able to get him some help along the way.
6284
But only if we leave immediately.
6284
Luckily for him, we have no alternative. Jack will arrive soon.
6284
When I said the race would be afoot, I was being literal.
6284
He will follow our trail, and match our speed.
6284
And since this is not the ideal scenario for a final showdown, the best we can hope to do is outrun him.
6285
Maybe it does. I'm not sure.
6285
But one good push in the right direction should be all we need.
6285
Troll Isaac Newton told him.
6285
That should help us greatly.
6285
Thank you, Aradia.
6596
Sup.
6597
No.
6597
Why?
6597
A thing?
6597
I see.
6597
I try to stay out of troll interpersonal politics.
6597
I'm saying no such thing!
6597
Dave, don't be a dick. You're embarrassing her.
6597
(shh!)
6598
Research.
6598
We're trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.
6598
You are aware this meteor has many secret rooms scattered throughout, including libraries, right?
6598
Can Town?
6598
No??
6598
Wow.
6598
What a story.
6598
Primarily to gain a more thorough understanding of the situation we'll be entering when we arrive.
6598
Oh my God.
6598
I've told you. I can't see the future!
6598
Ok. But not all of it. Only certain relevant pieces.
6598
It's a bit frustrating when people make that presumption about you.
6598
For instance, you are a Knight of Time. Since you have such mastery over time, doesn't that mean you should know everything about the future too?
6598
Right. So there are significant limitations on what you can know, governed by certain rules.
6598
That's how it is for a Seer too.
6598
But I will say that I have been able to use these abilities to assist with research.
6598
I can treat my finite glimpses as an additional source of information.
6598
If you combine that with the knowledge we've gathered from these texts, and things we've learned from our various encounters with the deceased, with a bit of inference and deduction, a more detailed picture is coming into focus.
6598
Do you want to hear about it?
6598
Yes.
6598
Why not? It's been a year.
6598
It seems like all we've done on this trip so far is indulge in lavish interior decoration projects and screw around with mysterious "Can Town" initiatives, which may or may not be consuming valuable library resources as building materials.
6598
We could make at least some effort to squeeze in annual briefings on our objective.
6598
I think you'll find that when it comes to striving for a reasonable approximation of legitimacy, we are simply the most barely adequate there is.
6598
Um. Sure.
6600
Are you talking to us?
6600
We can't even hear you mumbling over there.
6600
How's that coffee coming?
6600
Be sure it makes it to the table before it accumulates that strange unctuous film on the surface.
6601
No, it's something like an extensive journal.
6601
I'm recording everything we've been through so far, and detailed notes on everything we know about the game.
6601
I'm also using it to document our research, and extrapolate on the new session and players.
6601
Somewhat.
6601
I don't look at it that way.
6601
I'm approaching it from a standpoint of responsible historical documentation.
6601
Don't you think people in the future will want to know about our story?
6601
I think it could be a very useful resource some day.
6601
It could be helpful to others beginning their own quests.
6601
From what I understand, everything already has gone wrong before the game even started, in many different ways than ours did.
6601
There are indications of thicker political intrigue. Assassination attempts. And a usurpation of the throne more insidious than what we dealt with.
6601
But those examples still don't illustrate the fundamental fault with their session.
6601
Ours had a similar fault. It was a null session.
6601
Literature on the subject says null sessions are actually very common.
6601
It is any session resulting in failure, and as such, designed to result in failure from the start, due to Skaia's comprehensive "knowledge" of its own fate, and that of all it illumines.
6601
Biologically speaking, it's to be expected that null sessions far outnumber the successful ones. When it comes to reproductive systems, overwhelming redundancy is commonplace.
6601
A universe has a reproductive system that spreads many seeds, as it were, most of which never come to fruition. So we shouldn't feel too bad about our results, really. It was quite par for the course.
6601
But then, it would also seem that exceedingly few null sessions result in the birth of a massive green star fueled by two dead universes. For what it's worth.
6601
Well, yes. There's more to it though.
6601
The new session is essentially our session, rebooted with different parameters which also affected the original conditions of our universe.
6601
And strangely, it seems the new one is a null session as well, but within a much less common subset of all null sessions.
6601
This one is referred to as a void session.
6602
It's very simply a session in which nothing is prototyped before entry, at all.
6602
Hence, by Skaia's preemptive all-knowing and its influence on the rest of the incipisphere, there are not even any towers on Prospit or Derse built to receive the split kernels.
6602
See?
6602
I don't know what specifically led to the failure to prototype anything.
6602
But it doesn't really matter. As I said, the session was designed this way before they began playing. Any efforts to prototype may have been in vain regardless. Possibly subject to sabotage.
6602
Yes.
6602
It's just another way to create an infertile session. Though by a less catastrophic and bloody route we took to achieve the same result.
6602
By contrast, it leads to a rather harmless, uneventful session. Underlings remain unaugmented, and so does the royalty.
6602
And while this may sound advantageous to the players, it's a curse in disguise. The lack of prototypings which keeps adversaries unevolved has the same influence on the battlefield.
6602
Without successive prototypings, the battlefield will never reach its final form, which must be fertilized to grow a new universe.
6603
Instead, it remains in its most basic form, stuck in eternal stalemate.
6603
There is nothing players in a void session can do to change this. They are resigned to live out the rest of their days in a dead end session.
6603
It's a vast improvement.
6603
The new session is a blank slate, without a ridiculously short time limit for victory like ours had.
6603
There will be no time limit at all, in fact.
6603
Once we arrive, ostensibly that is when the nature of the session will change.
6603
It won't be classifiable as either a null or void session anymore. It will be something which, as far as I can tell, is unique.
6603
The fully matured battlefield from our session can be used to make the new one viable. The path to success will be made possible by a combination of efforts and assets from both iterations.
6603
Usually scratched sessions are absolute resets, and involve no direct influence from the first attempt at all. I can't find any precedent for our situation.
6603
Yes.
6603
Pretty much.
6603
As long as there is an actual vacancy in the center of Skaia when we get there.
6604
I don't think so.
6604
Even if it were, it would be a trivial obstacle.
6604
But as it is, I think the forces opposing these players are clandestinely working toward the same goal as we are.
6604
From what I can tell, gestures of antagonism, while certainly posing legitimate danger, have been factored in as critical stepping stones to one destination shared by all parties.
6604
I don't know why this is, or what the motives are yet.
6604
The appearance is one of clear sailing ahead, but traces of conspiracy are everywhere.
6605
Yes, we will have to deal with Jack before all is said and done.
6605
And that will definitely be a major challenge.
6605
But it is not impossible. At least, not by design.
6605
When I said there would be no time limit in this session, I was talking about something more specific.
6605
There will be no reckoning.
6605
It's a logical consequence of any void session.
6605
The battlefield never evolves, and therefore the more extensive war between Prospit and Derse never takes shape.
6605
It is only when the Prospitian king falls in battle that the reckoning can be initiated by the forces of Derse.
6605
The meteors then rush to destroy the battlefield, while Skaia redirects them through defense portals for as long as it can.
6605
Thus, if there is no war, there is no reckoning, no meteors, and no imminent threat of failure.
6605
This is of course good news for Earth as well. During the reckoning, Skaia redirects all incoming meteors to the only place it can. Earth.
6605
So it turns out that players who initiate a void session are not actually condemning their home planet to an apocalyptic wasteland after they leave.
6605
In the new instance of our universe, Earth is just fine.
6605
Sort of.
6605
Again: sort of.
6605
And it's not that there were no meteors whatsoever.
6605
Just the vast majority of the destructive onslaught never showed up.
6605
But delivering the temple to the site of the forge is still integral to jumpstarting the session.
6605
That meteor however could have been propelled through a portal by any means, not just via the reckoning.
6605
Yes.
6605
But they weren't flung through portals in their own session, nor will they be created there.
6605
They were created in our session, and sent back through our portals. Just like us.
6606
To understand what happened, it really helps to understand exactly what a scratch is.
6606
When John severely damaged the Beat Mesa on your planet, and sent it off to Skaia to release its temporal energy there, you could view it as a kind of "request."
6606
We were asking Skaia to change everything at a fundamental level, and we gave it the energy to do so.
6606
But Skaia is a very passive entity. It only "knows" and "sees," but it never quite "acts."
6606
When it is asked to change everything, there is only so much it has control over.
6606
In fact, it has control over exactly one thing. The defense portals.
6606
It can decide to send important meteors to different points in time than originally planned, thus creating alternate realities.
6606
Offshoots of promise, rather than futility.
6606
And it turns out the most important meteors of all tend to be the ones delivering the young players to their planet.
6606
So all it has to do to change everything is tweak their destination times a bit.
6606
All internally-prompted changes in the post-scratch universe are decided entirely by this modest adjustment to the parameters.
6606
It's a very simple concept, actually.
6606
Yet the consequences are dramatic. It results in not only a hard reset for the session, but a partial reset for the universe too, due to the many causal entanglements between a session and its originating universe.
6606
A variety of different time periods.
6606
The simplest way to way to look at it is to picture the original destinations of our two groups of four ecto-babies...
6606
And switch them.
6606
Though this is just a slight oversimplification.
6606
While it's roughly true, Skaia had some peculiar whims this time.
6607
While most landed in time periods corresponding with the original group,
6607
It seems that two of the new players arrived four centuries ahead of everyone else.
6607
For some bizarre reason.
6607
But they're still apparently able to communicate with their coplayers through I guess some Trollian-like technology, and they're still able to establish game connections with the others. So this stands as an odd but not otherwise terribly significant detail.
6607
I'll give you a hint.
6607
It isn't us.
6607
And to think that usually I'm the one accused of knowing the future.
6608
You would find it less disconcerting if the players were alternate versions of us?
6608
What?
6608
Meeting a deceased figure of authority as a peer?
6608
I honestly thought you would find the idea exciting.
6608
I know I'm looking forward to it.
6608
Not that I recall.
6608
But anecdotes like that just make me more curious to meet him, personally.
6608
She's your mom too, though.
6608
You do realize we've seen her already, right?
6608
Months ago.
6608
In a dream.
6608
She was floating along in Derse pajamas, asleep.
6608
Yes.
6608
You're wondering why I didn't tell you?
6608
You're specifically wondering why I wasn't forthcoming with an answer to your question at the time, "hey who was that choice babe in the pajamas?"
6608
You don't find it nostalgic at all?
6608
Retracing the steps of some of our Freudian semi-blunders in conversations past?
6608
;)
6608
;)
6609
Maybe you should lie down on the couch.
6885
(I think it's young Father-Grandad Harleybert.)
6888
(I'm not sure if that's a good idea.)
6888
(Ok, since I've clearly been outvoted on the matter, and democracy has spoken, I guess I should clarify.)
6888
(I'm not sure if it's actually possible.)
6888
(I don't think she's ever woken up before.)
6888
(You were technically already awake.)
6888
(Also, I don't happen to have any yarn on me at the moment.)
6888
(Do you have any yarn on you, Dave?)
6888
(Cheap cigars...?)
6888
(I just,)
6888
(Don't see how you can make remarks with such frequency that are so obliviously and so generically loaded from a Freudian perspective.)
6888
(It's flabbergasting, really. You never miss a chance.)
6888
(Cigars? Describing a scenario where you are both given birth to by your teen mother, as well as playing the role of the proud father in the waiting room?)
6888
(What should I make of the fact that the phallic imagery you've selected is not only inexpensive, but is administered freely and mirthfully to other expecting fathers?)
6888
(Or that the object standing in for the phallic symbol is something you're proposing to throw at our mother's head!)
6888
(Yes.)
6888
(But I don't think I know that spell.)
6888
(Not really?)
6888
(What?)
6888
(Um. Ok?)
6889
(Yeah?)
6889
(What?)
6889
(That's pretty much how she always slept.)
6889
(This includes discovering her sleeping in unusual places.)
6889
(Yes.)
6889
(Yes.)
6889
(I know from experience, I guess.)
6889
(Not really. But it grows on you to some extent.)
6889
(Do you remember the timeline Davesprite was from?)
6889
(I still remember some things.)
6889
(It was actually pretty similar to the way things have been for the last year on this meteor.)
6889
(There wasn't very much to do.)
6889
(But there was a house full of liquor.)
6889
(What are they talking about over there?)
6889
(I think we might be missing something important.)
6889
(They're looking at us.)
7302
SLUUUUUUUUUURRRRP.

Yea well,,

Omg, you're right, I messed a golden opportutiny for a puticularly humoroush approach to this endeavor... :(
7304
I tried!!
7304
I tried making it...
7304
Is was HARD, Dave.
7304
(Sluuurp.)
7304
Yes, tha's the POINT!
7304
Apples are stalartingly difficulf to reproduce.
7304
We take for granned our ability to take idealized intsances ofeven quie comlicated objects and conshure them from the void.
7304
But compalexity implies a heavilly recombinatife nature.. So.. so many things are synesthized from a series of mushh simpler ideas!
7304
To those ennities capable of, of conceshualization and absraction, an apple is as closed to being a noshushnally irredushible object as it gets....
7304
Ahem. *Notionally,
7304
**Irr, ed, ducible.
7304
Tell me, hoch shot, what ideas would you combide to make and apple?
7304
Exaaalley/.
7304
Thusis why apples are sush indivisible symbols, when it comes to thefield of ideas and their reducshunistHIC!!!!! reductionishtic essence from the perispective of humans in paticular.
7304
Both from a stantpoint of cultrulal and mytholurgical singificence,, and from a pratical one a swell, if you happen to fine yourself acshualy trying to ENGINEEEer one.
7304
Why do you thing, HIC!!! Why do you think Adam mand Eve were punished for biting in to one??
7304
They attemped to pentetrate an indivisible unit, uf fundamenetal knowledge. To consume the interior of a thought whish cantot be reduced any further.
7304
This knowleshe was for BIDDEN..! Hic. So humanity was forever bandished to live in sin, and, hass strive ever sinse to redeem isself from the hubrinse of this innallectual foily.
7304
Hahaha! , Foily.
7304
*FOLLY. :)
7304
Or what about, the tale of Isaac Newdon under the tree?? He was BONKED on the head by an apple.
7304
Not reallyan apple though... an atomic idea. An emlemental unit of inspripation itself, id clocked him right on then noggin.
7304
And this indivisible notion colliding with hish awareness, much like.. . a high speed partical fired to create a nuculear chain reacation, jarred from the void a more profund unnerstand, HIC, ing of the intrinsic nature of nothiness. Thatis,. Gravivitation.
7304
Of course thess stories are acutually bullshit. They didn't happen in realaity. But thef act that they'rare bullshit makes them more inshresting.
7304
Men have crefted many stories that are bullshit out of symbols risen from the abyss of coinsciousness withou necesharily knowing whath e fuck they were doing or saying, as they flounered around for some truth.
7304
Bust in spite of themseleves they would for howefer briefly cross through a ray of light regarless. Becuss of the sbymbols. Dave.. The symbols hol dall the power.
7304
For a guay whos's supposedly, an I quote, "so cool,"
7304
You relly are almost comically up tight.
7304
Here, why don't you have some...
7304

*Prude.

How you'are going to save your speshies. :)

7310
A felderal fucking eschew. Dono't you agree?
7310
!!
7311
Kaynaya.
7312
Can you kep a secret?
7313
I learned somethin earlier today.
7313
It was trobuling.
7313
Something about,
7313
Teresi.
7313
Aand,
7313
...
7313
And Gamshee.
7313
See...
7313
I bumped into him earliar.
7313
No no please, pleeasse don't get angry, and. ..
7313
Go on another vengeful clown hunting espedition, I...
7313
This is the point, this is was troubling me abou this.
7313
I don't want anyone to fight!
7313
You are?
7313
Yeahhh,
7313
Righ, well apparenly they..
7313
Are.
7313
An item?
7313
Blackways, I mean.
7313
The y'are spades dating. In theh shadowns... nobody knows. But me. An now,
7313
You.
7313
Yesh!!
7313
And it's been troubling me, the more I thing about it.
7313
All lot.
7313
Because it presends a prickly prolitical sishuation.
7313
Terezi's relationship with Karkant is already somewhat tenuous, with their... well from, what I've gathered, about their hishtory.
7313
And Dave! His involovment makes in even more complicated, and,
7313
I think, with Karkat being moirails to Gamzee, if he finds out Gamzee iss spades with Tetreezi, then...
7313
Correct me if I'm wrong but isin't that whole arrangemen getting into territory of social taboob?
7313
* Tabob. Escuse me.
7314
Right!!
7314
I don't no if it's my ser powers or what, but, HIC, I can see it unfolting all too clearly.
7314
Karkast finds out about it and flies inno a rage. It ruins hish moirlallegelleninance... I mean his moiraHIC!.. It ruins his diamonds with Gamzee, who thefore becomes less stable.
7314
And he villifies Trepezi as well, and who knows how she reacs. Or what happens with Dave for that matter.
7314
Would Dave actually be aright wich Terezi dating a psychotic clown on th side, even if its is a releationship centered around only enmity? I kinof doubt it.
7314
He could side with Korkat on the matter.. Not even tos peak of where your alignment is on the subjech of Gamzeen.
7314
Which is, what I fear. I'm afraid that,
7314
This could create a schisasm in our group, that we could all be torn apart.
7314
And I don't wand that!!!!!
7314
I want us all to stay friends, and jus be... peaceful togehter. :(
7314
I dun't know!!!
7314
Maybe I shouldn't intrefere with their kishmeshishit... kshimimishimesh.. Aw fuck.
7314
Their hate dating.
7314
Maybe it's..
7314
Just a wonderful thing for them. An I would beh hoorible to inerfere, with their..
7314
Beaufiful hate?
7314
The problem is, it's still soo alien to me. The idea of blapck romance.
7314
I try to understand, sometimes, like, more than inteclectually. I try to, put myself in the shoes of FEELING that an...
7314
It still dosn't make sense to me.
7314
I don't want to project my human valuesh on to an alien relationship I dispapprove of.
7314
No, what!
7314
Oh, puleashe. You KNOW you have to tall me now.
7314
Yeah??
7314
Oh shitch... I forgot about that..
7314
You're right, :o
7314
Yes...
7314
.
7314
hic.
7314
.
7314
YES.....
7315
KANAYA THAT IS EXAGLY WHAT I NEED TO DO!!!
7315
Absoulutely.
7315
I haf never been so shure.. about, anything.
7315
Well maybe, almost anaything.. :), but yes.
7315
I believe you.
7315
But I wants to know.
7315
Can you teach me?
7315
There's so mouch I just don't understand.
7315
About your romanse, but,
7315
I'm soi curious.
7315
I try to understand the concept of either contentatious or plastonic relationships as something that...
7315
Can be parshed through the emotions assoliated with romance but,,
7315
It still doesn't realay compute to me.
7315
Tha's fine..
7315
Forget aushpipshit...
7315
Auspishtishimish..
7315
Good damn.
7315

Mom? ROXY: mom?
7956
Humm?
7956
Ahaha.
7956
Kanaya, whas with this pregnancy shHIC! shit, are you trying to toll me something? ;)
7956
My civic dutie. ;)
7956
I have been desputized by the Mayor as the assasstant chief deputy of city plannning and preshervation.
7956
Kanya, I' am relaly SWAMPED in red tape here, do you think you coult please return whan I am no so busy, thanks!
7956
Either that, or file out a requisition form wish the zoning bureau.
7956
No, what would be terribule would be to bid farewell to this metreor before my critical adminitistrative work is complete.
7956
*LAFF.*
7956
God I just love troll words for things!
7956
Nushrition cylinders, thad's a good one. I forgot about that one.
7956
Maybe cylanders ins't stilted enough, though. What about.,.
7956
Tallcircles.
7956
;D
7956
I am docurmenting their original locations.
7956
Soo that we way relocate the city faithfully to our new home.
7956
Wheyrever that may be!
7957
Oh,, but you could not be further fromp the truth.
7957
The prestervation of Can Town has trenendous symbolic importance.
7957
We are ahll that's left of our respective races, Kanaye.
7957
We are the light of civivization!
7957
Is our responsipility to carry the torch through the abyss whilest keeping it lit, and hic...
7957
And set it pupon the harth of the newd world.
7957
Its light... OUUR light will spread throughout our creation, but only, Kayaka, ONLY,
7957
If we respect the light of civilazation itself. If we respect the light of DEMCOCRACY!!
7957
Civilitey/ Liberby. Reason. Efidication. Civilty.
7957
Rationality. Learning, Jutstice. Libersty. Hornor. Elucidution.. Civlity. Raison...
7957
This are the virshues which emboby the magnificence that is Can Town.
7957
Pfhaha! I just got it!
7957
"That'sh not all you managed to keep lit."
7957
That burn was siiiiiick! Hah,ahah I love it.
7958
I am ready!

7958
Well.
7958
I wasnt' going to.
7958
But I starded to think about evereything.
7958
About meeting my mom.
7958
And I startled getting nervous.. .
7958
Hey now.
7958
Kapaya, I'm flatter. But I think you're might be selling the Mayor short.
7958
THIS GUY
7958
Lemme tell yuoi.
7958
THIS GUYY,
7958
is
7958
THE BEST ;D
7959
No but, Karkaya.
7959

7959

7959
THE FUCKING MAYOR.
7959
Wat ay friend.
7959
And if I am? ;|
7959
Ohhhhh...
7959
He has his ways of letting is thoughts be known.
7959
He hays his ways.
7959
What issues?
7959
My indrescretion wich alcoholol?
7959
Or someshing else...
7959
I yam sensing we are tap toeing around a mixed bag of delicate subjex.
7959
Less talk about em ;).
7959
Kamaya, why do'nt we go aesy on the shout poles.
7959
I tolt you, to relax about the matribob.
7959
Have some faith in us, that we;re going to make everything work out.
7959
I have a vvvery goog feeling i twill all be fine. ;)
7959
But if I'm always happay then...
7959
Why IS it a problem?
7959
Im'm not following. I would LIKE to, wait am I...
7959
Have I been being a bistch to you witout realizing?
7959
Oh noh...
7959
I tried!
7959
I tried, Kakaka.
7959
But aushitspitschism... or whatever...
7959
Is's
7959
It sactually REALLY HARD!
7959
Whoops I'm sorry, Yakaya..

Don'ot worry guy,s
8125
I've vave a fealing evvvvvery thinks gogna work out. ;)
8245
Euurgh.
8246
Why does Lolar have to be so bright?
8249
I take it you are still detoxing from your overdose of appalling harlequin nectar?
8249
Do you need a turn with the pillow?
8249
You should try not to consume so much sugar.
8249
It's really bad for you.
8249
Good point.
8249
We seriously have to curtail our dependence on these respective liquids.
8249
The situation has become embarrassing for everyone.
8249
Maybe you and I should form some sort of support group.
8249
Isn't that what people do?
8249
I'm doing my best to dredge the memory of my dead civilization for salient protocol.
8249
I think that's what we're supposed to do.
8249
Once, when humanity was still a thing, those like us with similar problems would band together, smoke cigarettes, and psychologically dismantle each other.
8249
But like, in a positive way.
8249
It surely will be.
8249
Do you have any cigarettes?
8249
I suppose we could use some sticks of your chalk in a pinch. These turtles probably won't know the difference.
8249
Well we have to do something.
8249
I'm supposed to be guiding our team to a fortuitous outcome with my fancy light powers.
8249
How am I supposed to lead and inspire from under a velvet pillow?
8249
Also, my girlfriend thinks I'm an idiot.
8249
So there's that.
8249
Sure they do.
8249
I foresaw that they would, magically, not unlike a majestic wizardress.
8249
I think.
8249
At least I'm pretty sure I did at one point, before getting repeatedly plastered.
8249
Don't you remember what I said when we first met?
8249
I said your abilities would probably come in handy, didn't I?
8249
Yeah. Maybe.
8249
You just need to...
8249
Dig deep down and,
8249
Believe in yourself?
8249
Why don't you give that a shot.
8249
I'm sure when the time comes, accessing your full potential will involve tapping into just the right platitude.
8249
I don't know. I'm too hung over to give good seering advice.
8249
You see? This is the problem.
8249
Hence the need for a not-entirely-ironic support group.
8249
Let's do it. I declare Rainbow Rumpus Rehab Town is now in session.
8249
Where the fuck is a gavel when you need one...
8250
Hey.
8250
My planet is nice.
8250
Well. In the shade at least.
8250
...
8262
Thanks, John.
8262
I expect they will become THE central accessory to my new signature look.
8262
One that perfectly captures my personality and sense of style.
8262
Ostensibly forever.
8262
That was a nice entrance.
8262
You swept all those bothersome artifacts out of here too, it would seem.
8262
I couldn't even begin to speculate as to the nature of the disturbing phenomena.
8262
Could you?
8262
These are god tier abilities you are using, I presume?
8262
:)
8262
John, why do you think you're the only one who can remember the missing events?
8263
What power?
8263
A magic thing?
8263
Pirates??
8263
Blurry.
8263
...
8263
Sure.
8263
Hmm.
8263
Can you demonstrate this ability?
8263
Even so, it will be worth noting if you're able to refine the ability.
8263
Could you please keep me informed of any developments?
8263
And while you're at it, maybe you could tell us exactly what happened just after we arrived.
8263
That's good.
8263
We need you out there if we're going to stand a chance of accomplishing anything.
8263
I agree with our prior conclusions. Finding the other players is imperative.
8263
Given the current state of the session, I would not be surprised if they are all prisoners as well.
8263
Do you think you can find them?
8263
...
8263
That's a good question.
8263
First, I guess just tell them,
8263
We're here.
8263
I don't know. We'll figure something out.
8263
My mom?
8263
I know.
8263
Uh,
8263
Wow.
8264
Tell her...
8264
Tell her I'm sorry for being such a shitty daughter?
8264
Wait, no.
8264
That wouldn't make any sense to her.
8264
This girl has no clue what a shitty daughter I was.
8265
I don't know. Just tell her whatever you think I should say.
8265
I'm not exactly in top form here, John.
8265
And in any case, no one's ever accused me of being an awesome candidate for the Hallmark writing staff.
8265
Just...
8265
Promise you'll find her, ok?
8265
Thanks.
8268
JOHN, WAIT!
8269
COME BACK!
8270
COME BACK!
8271
I thought of something to tell her.
8272
Dammit!
8273
Uhnf!
8273
Ow.
8274
Where did my velvet pillow go?
8306
TEREZI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?
8307
Alright, then.
8308
What exactly are we supposed to be doing here?
8309
Why did she group the two seers together?
8309
Was there a point to that?
8309
What is her goal with these divide and conquer tactics?
8309
Everything is so unclear.
8309
Threads leading to the most fortuitous outcomes have gotten so badly tangled.
8309
I can't tell if it's the hangover, or if something else is happening.
8309
Something out there...
8309
Unaccounted for.
8309
Why can't I see it?
8309
Why have I become so blind again?
8309
No offense, Terezi.
8309
NO, I'M TALKING TO MYSELF!
8309
STOP MAKING ME YELL! I STILL HAVE A HEADACHE, AND SO DO YOU!
8310
Why am I talking to myself?
8310
I think I've spent too much time around Dave.
8310
I've also probably spent too much time sharing his genes.
8310
Why must our family tree be plagued by so many shameless soliloquists?
8310
I wonder if our young parents are like this?
8310
I wonder if I will ever find out?
8310
And what should I do in the meantime?
8310
Should I...
8310
Should I really work on completing my personal planetary quest?
8310
That whole thing where I learn to "play the rain?"
8310
I guess I should feel exhilarated to have the chance again after all these years.
8310
Of course I should.
8310
But then,
8310
Why does it sound like such a drag?
8310
I haven't played the violin in a long time.
8310
I wonder if I even remember how.
8310
Honestly I can't recall ever feeling less motivated to satisfy a looming obligation.
8310
I think my quest was fundamentally bound to the nature of this land, which was customized to the profile, needs, and potential for growth of a thirteen year-old girl.
8310
But I'm not that person anymore.
8310
What if I
8310
What if I just
8310
Didn't bother doing it?
8310
Like, ever?
8310
Would anyone notice my dereliction?
8310
Would the powers that be strike me down where I loaf?
8310
What if I just said fuck it?
8310
What then, silly pink tortoise shells? Hmmmm??
8310
I guess I should stop procrastinating and have This Conversation with Kanaya.
8311
So.
8311
Have you made any progress in determining what our malefactors want from you and Karkat?
8311
Well?
8311
And?
8311
...
8311
Are you still there?
8311
Speak to her about what?
8311
I see.
8311
At least it would seem you have a project.
8311
Terezi and I have received no such instruction.
8311
Hello?
8311
Kanaya, do you want to talk about my problem?
8312
The one pertaining to my substance abuse.
8312
Are you busy?
8312
You seem preoccupied.
8312
What are you doing?
8312
You're buying things?
8312
What things?
8312
Like what?
8312
And from whom?
8312
Are you in a consort village?
8312
Don't those shops only sell jars of bugs and such?
8312
You're not buying jars of bugs, are you?
8312
Kanaya, I'm confused.
8312
Could you be a little more descriptive?
8312
Your problem?
8312
Don't you mean my problem?
8314
TEREZI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
8555
Yes?
8555
Could you elaborate?
8556
Then let us bounce.
8635
DAVE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
8651
Mr. Strider?
8651
What are you doing to this troll, if I might ask?
8654
Gotcha.
8709
GAMZEE!
8709
STOP THAT!!
8710
Or, wait.
8710
Is this some sort of blackrom thing?
8710
I certainly hope not.
8711
Think, Lalonde. Think!
8711
What did Kanaya tell you about this quadrant?
8711
Does it really involve such gruesome fisticuffs?
8711
I...
8711
I can't remember!
8711
I was probably drunk during that particular lesson.
8711
What am I saying.
8711
I was drunk for all the lessons!
8711
Ugh, what a disgrace.
8711
I am the actual worst auspistice who ever lived.
8711
THE ACTUAL WORST!!!
8729
ENOUGH!
8730
I don't care if it IS some sort of grisly courtship ritual.
8730
THIS HAS TO STOP!
