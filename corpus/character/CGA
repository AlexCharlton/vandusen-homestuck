I Dont Think We Did Anything Special
Last 12th
We Stayed In
And I Read Stories To Her It Was Nice
Yeah I Know
I Wasnt Sure If I Was Going To
But Then I Noticed A Conversation In Which I Was A Participant
Which As It Turns Out Is The Conversation Taking Place Now
I Scanned It Briefly And Then Perused Other Memos For My Presence
I Found None And Returned To This One
But My Part Of The Conversation Was Gone
I Regarded This As A Prompt To Begin Typing And Record My Contributions Live
That Is How This Works Isnt It
What Exactly Happened
No
Alright
In A Moment
It Seems Like A Logical Way To Engineer A System Wherein One Simultaneously Functions As The Reader And Author Of The Transcripts
Its Temporally Sound Construction
I Think We Are Given Roles To Challenge Us
That Dont Necessarily Suit Our Strengths
At Least I Was
I Have No Idea What Im Doing Here
Oh
At This Point Im Not Even Sure If Im Inclined To Ask Anymore
Um
There Is A Good Way To Go I Think Yeah
Its Such A Silly Question
What
Thats Not What This Is About
Im Not Sure What To Say About It
Not Really
If I Were Thinking About It I Probably Wouldnt Have Wanted To Anyway
Dont You Think Its Better To Have Unrehearsed Conversations
Even If The Subject Matter Is Awkward
Ok
Red Then
But I Guess
Not Really Red Enough
Its Not The Asking I Mind
Its The Telling
In A Public Forum
No
It Appeared To Be Just The Two Of Us
I Dont Know Whether Thats Reassuring
Or Just A Bit Disheartening
Disinterest Is The Operative Concept Here
Shes Not Even Responding To My Messages Anymore
Could Be Busy
But Im Rapidly Approaching A Resolution To Discard The Preposterous Infatuation
Shit
How About
If I Agree To Consult With You About It In Private
We Can Drop It Here
Before You Crack Me Like A Vault
With Your Weird Romance Sleuthing Acumen
It Still Puzzles Me That You Are So Versed In The Topic
Do You Have Access To A Manual Archived On A Remote Server Somewhere
That Figure Of Speech You Keep Using Puzzles Me Too
Im Not Qualified To Say
Neither Romance Nor Psychology Are My Strong Suits
And What Of Scarlet Ambitions
Fare Any Better In That Quadrant
Oh Fine
Heres This Silly Question For You
I Was Just Wondering Given Your Vantage Of Hindsight
If Youd Had Cause To Observe At Any Point In Time
Magic
Like Real Magic
I Guess What Im Asking Is
Is Magic A Real Thing
I Know
Its Just That I Have A Good Reason To Believe Magic Is Real
Our Ancient Predecessors Discovered How To Use It
But Then They May Have Surpassed Us In Skill By A Great Deal
Sure
Heh
Im Running Out Of Ideas
I Need To Figure Out A Way To Stoke This Volcano
In Case You And The Others Are Successful In Recovering The Queens Ring
I Guess You Would Know
Still Baffled By What Would Conceivably Cause Such A Crisis In Awesomeness Post-Victory
No
Say Hi To Me For Myself
You Mean Future Me
What
What Did I Do
What Happened
Shithive Maggots You Mean
Til Then
