the direct effects 0f a scratch are limited t0 the sessi0n inv0king it
we w0uld n0t experience 0r 0bserve th0se effects fr0m 0ur sessi0n
but we w0uld experience the c0nsequences
in the f0rm 0f that which prevented us fr0m claiming 0ur reward
he wh0se hand w0uld be f0rced by the scratch
t0 emerge fr0m hiding
but there w0uld be n0 adequate way t0 prepare
even with all the f0resight at 0ur disp0sal
f0r a f0e m0re p0werful than the king we will and have already defeated
f0r a dem0n wh0 is indestructible
0mnip0tent
and enraged
while the rest 0f the party w0uld absc0nd
0ur duplicates w0uld buy us time
they w0uld all be killed
again
all except f0r me
this is just as well i supp0se
what w0uld we even d0 with all th0se c0pies anyway
we w0uld return t0 the site 0f 0ur hatching
s0 t0 speak
where we w0uld hide
amidst a veil depleted by the reck0ning
and wait
drifting in the wide 0rbit 0f 0ur s00n t0 be null sessi0n
banished fr0m the  we left behind
and yet in being denied 
we w0uld be barred fr0m entry
int0 the  we created
i will n0t be participating
