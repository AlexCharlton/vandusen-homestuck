Hi.
Karkat, shut up! This does not concern you.
Tavros, it's ok. Really.
So you don't feel that way a8out me! That's fine. I shouldn't have expected any different.
I can deal with it! I am not a wimp like you. I roll with 8ad 8r8ks all the time. No 8iggie.
In fact, I already have dealt with it. I was over here dealing with it while you were over there on the floor fooling around with your computer after a cute girl tried to kiss you for some reason.
As it turned out, fooling around with your computer to........
Go cry on future Karkat's shoulder a8out this????????
Hahahaha. You are a str8nge and funny 8oy, Tavros.
Karkat I said shut the fuck up!!!!!!!!
Anyway, though totally unnecessary, your apology is accepted.
Now pick yourself up off the floor so we can go wring some fucking treasure out of this misera8le magic rock!
Actually, never mind, I'll 8e over there to help you with that too, kind of like I do with everything.
Just lie still and try not to start crying or anything, and w8 a few minutes for your timeframe to catch up with mine.
Exactly! I aaaaaaaam smarter than you. You see? You're learning!
