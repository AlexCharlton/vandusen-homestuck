6036
Oh, that's fine!
6036
I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.
6036
Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!
6036
As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.
6036
I talked to him yesterday. That's as much help as I can be!
6036
Hoo hoo.
6036
I love that thing. :B
6036
What do you need with him?
6036
Does this have to do with your crazy pen pal project?
6036
Sorry, J. :(
6036
This would be the birthday present... for your grandmother?
6036
Her and me.
6036
"A joint gift from her and me." Grammar, Jake!
6036
So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?
6036
You are a very strange and silly boy.
6036
Well,
6036
Godspeed, then! I do hope you can pull it off.
6036
No!!
6036
Hey! I have believed in you too.
6036
However, believing somebody isn't the same thing as believing IN somebody.
6036
But that much said...
6036
I think that maybe I am getting ready to believe some of the wild stories I've heard?
6036
Or, if not believe outright, reserve judgment on, at least.
6036
I don't know!
6036
I'm still not sure what to think. But what I wanted to tell you this morning was...
6036
I had a really wild dream last night.
6036
And you were in it.
6036
Sh! Not like that.
6036
It was so real! I think we were in the game, even though we haven't started playing yet.
6036
I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.
6036
Um...
6036
Not a heck of a lot!
6036
I really want to tell you all about it, but it will take some time to explain, and we both have things to attend to.
6036
You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!
6036
Yes, ok, good luck Jake!
6044
Why, hellooooooo.
6044
:B!
6044
Gosh! So formal today.
6044
D'aww.
6044
You needn't worry about easing my nerves.
6044
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be nearly as thrilled about today as I am!
6044
That is reassuring!
6044
No, I haven't seen her online yet today.
6044
I'm really hoping Lalonde won't flake out on me this time. Have you heard from her?
6044
If you say so.
6044
Oh!
6044
I wanted to tell you, I had an amazing dream last night!
6044
I believe it may have been of the sort you described. A dream of awakening, presuming I haven't just flatout lost my marbles.
6044
I was in a bright gold city. Above was a brilliant blue sky, but the horizon was dark as night.
6044
Was this the place you told me about? What was it called...
6044
Ah, shucks, does this count as a "causal spoiler?"
6044
I didn't see you there. At least, I don't think I did!
6044
Ok then.
6044
I mentioned this briefly to Jake, and he didn't have much to say before we parted ways.
6044
I will gather that if this is all true, then it means Jake had not awoken yet?
6044
I don't know.
6044
But there was one thing about the dream that was very troubling.
6044
I'm becoming nervous to consider what it might mean.
6044
Hrm. I'm still not sure I appreciate what that means, but I appreciate that a nice gesture has been made if you say so!
6044
I guess I should just start believing all of this now, huh? Rather than learning it to be true later and feeling the fool for all my curmudgeonly skepticism?
6044
For starters, I guess I could drop my reservations about your story?
6044
I can write off much to tomfoolery as I'm no stranger to a good prank myself. But quite honestly you seem too kind for this charade. Not the type I'd expect to trot out such persistent falsehoods beyond their humorous welcome.
6044
So what do I know! Consarn it, maybe you are an alien girl from Uranus, and together we are about to play a game which determines the fate of existence. Sign me up!
6056
Omg.
6056
Overreact much? I kept you waiting for all of two seconds!
6056
Where have you been today?
6056
"All of a sudden."
6056
This hit you just now? We made plans to get in touch early this morning, and I have seen neither hide nor hair of you all day.
6056
Oh, for Pete's sake.
6056
Grrr.
6056
Now I know you're joking around to get my goat.
6056
Nooooo, stop. :(
6056
Yeah. Because it's weird!
6056
And you're drunk. :P
6056
I don't see why you don't try to court the favor of Mr. Strider. If you ask me, he and you are perfect for each other.
6056
Lordy.
6056
How can you be this fargone so early?
6056
It isn't even noon yet.
6056
You're three hours ahead of me!
6056
Tsk. What would your mother have to say if she caught you?
6056
So even if your insane and paranoid theory happens to be true, your response is, "Screw it! Time to help myself to all this mind game booze."
6056
Groan. You are completely impossible like this.
6056
I cannot believe you chose to do this today of all days. I should have known better!
6056
Here I am waking up bright and early, waiting all day with my nose pressed against this glass for the mail to come and wondering if you'll ever log on, and all the while you are just getting blind stinking schnocker-bottomed drunk.
6056
&%#$@!!!
6056
The alpha!
6056
Jeez-Louise, you are hopeless.
6056
Are you at all ready to play if it comes?
6056
Not this again.
6056
The "Batterwitch" DOES NOT EXIST!
6056
It is an idiotic urban legend.
6056
How many times have I explained this? My great, great grandmother who founded the company and is accused of holding this identity would have to be almost two hundred years old if she were still alive today. The idea is such preposterous hogwash it's hardly worth dignifying with a rational response.
6056
The iconic face of the company isn't even a real person! She was fabricated long ago during the company's fledgling years.
6056
Such cuckoobird nonsense.
6056
In any case, I don't understand the nature of this second guessing, besides chalking it up to your unwelcome inebriation.
6056
We had agreed you would play with me. You sounded excited about it!
6056
Have you even obtained your copy yet??
6056
Through your various technologically crypotgraphic means, I presume?
6056
:|
6056
I am quizzically narrowing my eyes trying to solve the joke you are attempting, assuming it even is one.
6056
Oh.
6056
Really?
6056
Hrm. That is a bit puzzling. I thought this software was highly proprietary.
6056
Ump, yes, I know. You've made yourself clear.
6056
But what doesn't add up about your story is,
6056
I believe SOMEBODY doesn't want me to play.
6056
How else do you explain the recent attempts on my life?
6056
"there"
6056
So this hypothetical monstrosity wants me to succeed, but also wants me to die?
6056
Makes a lot of sense!
6056
I see. This is sounding less like a crackpot conspiracy theory by the minute!
6056
Hm. It's tempting, and I'm curious as heck to play it.
6056
But the mail should be coming any minute! I've waited this long for it, so I might as well use the official discs addressed to me.
6056
When it comes, I do hope you'll change your tune.
6056
Not to mention brew yourself a pot of coffee and sober your drunk butt up.
6056
Hoo hoo! Ok, fair enough.
6056
But I believe that when we start playing together, you'll come around.
6056
Personally, I can hardly contain my excitement over it.
6056
If years ago someone told me, which incidentally someone DID, that today I would have an exclusive opportunity to play what is absolutely the most cutting edge immersive simulation game ever released, developed by a company which has already done so much for the advancement of humanity, I would have said, "Shucks, buster, sign me up!"
6056
Yes?
6056
What!
6056
Shoosh you, drunky! :B
6056
Oh...
6056
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
6056
The thing.
6056
The flappy thing!
6057
THE FLAPPY SWINGY DOODAD.
6057
THE ARM DEALIE.
6057
THE DEALIE, LALONDE, THE DEALIE!!!
6057
THE GODDARNED RED SWINGY FLAPPY LEVER ARM THINGAMABOB, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.
6057
ON THE MAILBOX.
6057
IT'S UP.
6057
IT'S UP, IT'S UP, IT'S UP.
6057
NO, WHO CARES ABOUT THAT! THE DEALIE, THE DEEEEEAAAALIEEEEEEE!!!
6057
IT'S UP, IT'S UP, IT'S HERE IT'S HERE IT'S HERE!
6057
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
6057
Brb.
6088
Oh, that's fine!
6088
I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.
6088
Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!
6088
As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.
6088
I talked to him yesterday. That's as much help as I can be!
6088
Hoo hoo.
6088
I love that thing. :B
6088
What do you need with him?
6088
Does this have to do with your crazy pen pal project?
6088
Sorry, J. :(
6088
This would be the birthday present... for your grandmother?
6088
Her and me.
6088
"A joint gift from her and me." Grammar, Jake!
6088
So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?
6088
You are a very strange and silly boy.
6088
Well,
6088
Godspeed, then! I do hope you can pull it off.
6088
No!!
6088
Hey! I have believed in you too.
6088
However, believing somebody isn't the same thing as believing IN somebody.
6088
But that much said...
6088
I think that maybe I am getting ready to believe some of the wild stories I've heard?
6088
Or, if not believe outright, reserve judgment on, at least.
6088
I don't know!
6088
I'm still not sure what to think. But what I wanted to tell you this morning was...
6088
I had a really wild dream last night.
6088
And you were in it.
6088
Sh! Not like that.
6088
It was so real! I think we were in the game, even though we haven't started playing yet.
6088
I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.
6088
Um...
6088
Not a heck of a lot!
6088
I really want to tell you all about it, but it will take some time to explain, and we both have things to attend to.
6088
You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!
6088
Yes, ok, good luck Jake!
6108
J, how goes the bunnyquest?
6108
Tell me about it.
6108
Dad has the whole house in full fatherly lockdown mode. Talk about blowing a few measly "assassination attempts" way out of proportion!
6108
So I'm currently mulling over my next move.
6108
What is it that has you hamstrung? Did you ever track down the slippery Mr. Strider?
6108
Sounds dangerous!
6108
Why is it that our two best friends in the world always seem to place themselves at the source of all our problems, while simultaneously presenting their only solutions?
6108
I'm debating whether or not to enlist his help in the matter of my current imprisonment. But I'd rather keep it as a plan of last resort.
6108
We'll see.
6108
So I take it you're out and about now?
6108
Right. Well, not to keep you too long, since we both still have our missions ahead of us, but I wanted to tell you about that dream I had.
6108
Hoo. :B
6108
Ok, but, I should say that the nature of the dream was a bit worrisome.
6108
And I'm concerned it may have implications for the game we're about to play.
6108
So it's probably best that I tell you about it before you leave.
6109
I woke up on the planet which we have been told about by our mutual acquaintance.
6109
The one covered in golden cities. Prospit, remember?
6109
Yes, you're right. It was the moon, actually. I could see the planet on the dark horizon.
6109
I was dressed in a golden dress, like a sort of nightgown, and I could fly. I left my bedroom, which was at the top of a tall tower. Surrounding me were the gold cities, just as described.
6109
Behind the skyline was darkness. But just above was a bright blue sky and puffy white clouds.
6109
Yes, probably.
6109
Are you sure you haven't woken up there before?
6109
I see. The impression I have developed is that this is supposed to be a real place, and all who dream there have shared experiences.
6109
Did Jade ever mention seeing us there?
6109
Hrmm. Anyway...
6110
I explored the moon, and began to notice people gathering in the streets.
6110
But they weren't human. They were funny looking, perfectly white creatures.
6110
Well, I don't know if they had much to do with chess here.
6110
The more closely I observed, the more they appeared somewhat despondent.
6110
Yes.
6110
I determined they were in mourning, actually.
6110
Shoosh! I'm getting there.
6111
More and more Prospitians were filing out of the buildings every moment.
6111
They all began to form a single, major procession.
6111
When I got closer, I could see that some were in tears.
6111
I realized this was a funeral.
6112
I heard whispers, but couldn't make out what they were saying, so I got closer.
6112
They were all saying the same thing, over and over.
6113
"The Page is dead."
6113
"Our hope is lost."
6115
Jake.
6115
The Page was you.
6116
Yes, I saw your body lying in a sort of coffin, on a bed of flowers. You were dead as a doornail.
6116
Everyone was so distraught!
6116
Including me. :(
6117
But before I could get too horribly upset, let alone make sense of any of it, I woke up.
6117
I of course immediately wanted to tell you all about, but it was still well before sunrise for you, and you were surely still asleep.
6117
Then as the day went on I guess I became distracted by other things. You know how it is.
6117
I hope I'm not too late to "warn" you, though to be frank I don't have the foggiest clue what it is I'm warning you about.
6117
"Dear Jake, oh please do try not to... have already... died in my dream? Likely while you were sleeping, perhaps peacefully?"
6117
Still, I think you'll agree that it's to be viewed as a troubling omen.
6117
I care very much for you, and I don't know what I'd do if I lost you both in my dreams, and here in this world.
6117
So for whatever good it does, just please be extra careful out there today!
6117
Hooray! Will do. ;B
6117
Now let's get this silly old adventure off to the races before the coat of dust it's growing gets any thicker.
6156
Oh, no.
6156
I'm just trying to leave my house!
6156
Is this the real you, btw?
6156
Ok. Just making sure!
6156
Jake was having some issues with it earlier, and I don't think he received its obfuscating tendencies in the humorous spirit intended.
6156
Oh, so you're talking to Jake then?
6156
:B
6156
Was it that bad?
6156
Why not just turn it off then?
6156
Who?
6156
These lectures I presume are roughly similar in complexion to those I'm familiar with?
6156
Those wherein I have, and I quote, "got to be more like Jake?"
6156
I sincerely doubt that I am!
6156
Let's not talk about my "issues" again, shalln't we?
6156
Shush!
6156
The word shalln't escape my vocabulary any longer, just as you SHALLN'T nitpick my language! That's my turf you're on, buster.
6156
What were you saying?
6156
About leaving the responder on!
6156
Jake?
6156
True.
6156
Dialogic?
6156
Are you saying you have conversations with your own auto-responder?
6156
Hrm, that's interesting.
6156
I guess I always thought it was just a really elaborate gag!
6157
Sometimes your sense of humor seems more impenetrably advanced than your robotics. I'll never understand this tapestry of irony you weave.
6157
Maybe I'm just stuck in the dark ages of pranksterism with my funny mustaches corny old joke book.
6157
Is that a note of bitterness directed at your superstar brother I am detecting?
6157
Oh lordy. Yes, yes, I know. I don't need another ironic lesson in science fiction!
6157
Flaws?? Talk about understatement. Those movies are unwatchable.
6157
Unless your name is Jake English.
6157
Ermm...
6157
If you say so!
6157
I dunno. Call me a simpleton, but I just like funny jokes.
6158
Well, aside from thousands of dollars in corpse-repair richer, I can't say.
6158
I can think of cuter places for him to sleep, frankly!
6158
Oh, please.
6158
Anyway, property damage and desecration to cherished elders aside, Mr. Bear has been a lovely addition to the family.
6158
Oh... no.
6158
I keep forgetting I'm supposed to!
6158
Sorry.
6158
I will name him right now!
6158
How about Lil' Sebastian?
6158
Yeah!!!
6158
So then, are you saying Mr. Sebastian here was an ironic present?
6158
Relayed strictly for guffaws?? >:B
6158
Huh?
6158
What! Really? :O
6158
I thought you said you didn't have such an heirloom to complete the plushie trifecta?
6158
Ooh. Risky!
6158
So it's from a movie?
6158
Nope.
6158
Wait...
6158
Wasn't that some bit of action schlock from the 90's?
6158
Some of the silly nonsense referenced in his work was well before my time. I don't have the wherewithal to investigate all this minutia.
6158
That does sound a tad obsessive. Wasn't he furious about your burglary?
6158
Why didn't you mention this when you gave the gift? More irony?
6158
I see. So it was like a private joke, and if anyone besides you was in on it, the joke would be ruined!
6158
D'awwwww.
6158
Wait, real sentiment, or ironic sentiment?
6158
Or is there no difference?? Am I missing the point here?
6158
This is fascinating, if a wee bit more dissertation than I bargained for this morning.
6158
I have so much to learn. And I am not even saying that "ironically!"
6158
Will you teach me your ways one day, sir? Perhaps an apprenticeship will open?
6159
Tempting, but that rain check will have to stay unendorsed for now.
6159
Lil' Seb is beginning to act out, and I must put his fidgetiness to constructive use!
6159
Um, no?
6159
This is news to me. I never gathered that "team leader" was a thing for this game.
6159
Are you sure? I have my doubts.
6159
I believe as a group we will have the temerity to succeed, without my having to order people around like an insufferable bossypants.
6159
Hm?
6159
That's stupid!
6159
Precisely!
6159
There is a BIG difference!
6159
Oh yes?
6159
Then this whole affair will be one of D. Strider's grand productions in puppetry?
6159
These lessons we talked about...
6159
They've already begun, haven't they? :o
6159
Holy moly!
6159
Um, thank you, but no.
6159
I'm not ready to get dialogic with my cyberself just yet. My friends keep me busy enough as it is.
6159
Speaking of which, I really need to go. I know you love to talk my ear off, and it's always a treat, but let's catch up later after the game starts, ok?
6159
And if I do need your help, I promise I'll take you up on your offer!
6159
The one where you, hopefully not literally, offered to catch me in the crevice of a great big squishy butt! Hoo hoo hoo!
6159
Gtg!!! <3
6332
Heyyy.
6332
Ahem.
6332
Ro-Lal?
6332
Oh?
6332
With whom?
6332
Yeah.
6332
Um... which one, precisely?
6332
If the chats and surplus dinners were truly important, I wouldn't want to interrupt.
6332
Actually,
6332
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
6332
You see, I was just the target of another assassination attempt.
6332
Two, in fact! One here in the real world, as I attempted to retrieve the mail.
6332
Luckily it was thwarted by a certain cat who shall remain nameless.
6332
But in the process of being rescued from the explosion, I was knocked unconscious.
6332
And in my dream, there was another assassination attempt.
6332
This one I believe was successful!
6332
I'm becoming convinced that our "dream selves" are being picked off by violent hooligans.
6332
Perhaps.
6332
The one who accosted me was a knife-wielding lunatic.
6332
And it's reasonable to deduce the same forces were responsible for Jake's death on Prospit as well.
6332
It looks like we are in the clutches of an actual caper. A real life mystery!
6332
Which under different circumstances would be quite exciting.
6332
But the truth is, I think we are all in great danger!
6332
Yeah, yeah. :p
6332
But that wasn't all there was to the dream.
6332
Shortly before I was stabbed, I had a rather long gander at Skaia.
6332
Yes.
6332
I would say a pretty substantial gander.
6332
I saw things in the clouds.
6332
Yes.
6332
Things.
6332
Things happening in the future, I think.
6332
Many events pertaining to us. All of us, and other people I didn't recognize.
6332
It was a bit overwhelming.
6332
It made me feel small. Insignificant, relative to whatever it is we're about to involve ourselves with.
6332
And honestly...
6332
It made me feel pretty foolish too.
6332
I began to wonder why I ever had the audacity to think I know much of anything about the world we live in or the journey we're about to take.
6332
Or to think I could ever rule anything out.
6332
I have a feeling that whatever I saw, it means you've been telling the truth all along.
6332
About everything.
6332
And I'm starting to feel like a complete idiot for doubting you.
6332
I've been one great big horse's caboose, and I think you're owed an apology.
6332
Do you think you can forgive me?
6332
Why?
6332
I did.
6332
And at this point, I guess I have no choice but to use it. I guess you were a step ahead of me yet again.
6332
Because the one in the mail detonated in my most recent assassination attempt.
6332
:B
6332
Hoo hoo! The tactic was quite underhanded, yes.
6332
I don't blame you.
6332
Where we were, by my estimation, was a place wherein I was about to awkwardly attempt to swallow a helping of humble pie.
6332
To somehow make it up to you for my years of stubborn mistrust.
6332
Hm?
6332
Oh!!!
6332
Oh gosh, what a doofus.
6332
You see?? I clearly don't have all the answers!
6332
I really had some nerve challenging anyone, on practically any subject.
6332
That's fair. But I would still like to make a gesture.
6332
Even if it's one partially motivated by self interest, seeing as I clearly have much to learn.
6332
I would like to give you a free pass for a day.
6332
It is good for twenty-four solid hours of absolute credulity from your best friend.
6332
:B
6332
It means that starting now, whatever you tell me, I will have to believe you.
6332
I promise!
6332
Yes.
6332
Um,
6332
Are you there?
6332
Ro???
6332
Oh.
6332
Hmm.
6332
Exactly how dramatic are we talking, here?
6332
Shall I go retrieve a magazine?
6332
Sigh.
6333
Hmm.
6333
Everything, I guess. I'd like to get completely up to speed, if possible.
6333
Some reiteration certainly couldn't hurt.
6333
But this time I won't work so hard to sift the fantastical from the plausible.
6333
Sure.
6333
Oh, I know that!
6333
That was always something I had no trouble believing, considering the public documentation even reclusive celebrities receive.
6333
And frankly, the family resemblance is obvious.
6333
Anyway, it would be disingenuous if I found your relation far fetched, since we're all apparently related to noteworthy people. It's just one of those funny things.
6333
Maybe we should start at the very beginning.
6333
Do you remember around when we first started talking?
6333
And you claimed you were the one making my pumpkins disappear?
6333
You later proceeded to try to prove to me that what you were saying was true.
6333
But none of your attempts thereafter would ever bear any fruit, pardon the pun.
6333
Yes, I know what pumpkins are. It was a joke, silly.
6333
What I'm trying to say is, in thinking back to those days, when you couldn't verify your claims, it made me think the whole thing was a big ruse.
6333
And I think this unfortunately began a pattern of mistrust. It was always hard to rule out the possibility that you could be joking about other things as well.
6333
I couldn't begin to explain the science behind such a technology either.
6333
But I guess the important thing is, regardless of how or why it works, this is a story you continue to stand by?
6333
That is, you are still taking credit for the mysterious disappearance of all those pumpkins I grew years ago?
6333
...
6333
Did you gank them when my gourd was down?
6333
Very well!
6333
Then I believe that is what happened.
6333
That's all I am trying to say here.
6333
Now... nothing, really.
6333
You may continue to tell me anything you would like with the confidence that I won't doubt you.
6333
So by all means, go ahead!
6333
Oh, come on!
6333
That is a question!
6333
It's not any sort of revelation, or statement for me to take at face value.
6333
Dadburn it. This isn't that difficult!
6333
And for the record, it's not great.
6333
GETTING STABBED BY A BAD GUY. IT ISN'T ALL THAT PEACHY.
6333
So, you're not in the mood to tell me things?
6333
Um...
6333
Madrigogs?
6333
Yeah, I understand.
6333
It's not about pity!
6333
It's more like a gesture I'm trying to make.
6333
Or maybe that's not quite right.
6333
It has more to do with setting things right for myself than making it up to you.
6333
Does that make sense?
6333
Shoot, I'm doing such a terrible job explaining this! :(
6333
The bottom line is, I WANT to believe the things you say now.
6333
That's all you need to know!
6333
*Shudders uncontrollably at "word" usage.*
6333
Sure!
6334
I don't know.
6334
The baking chest, maybe?
6334
D'aw.
6334
That's sweet of you, I guess?
6334
What are the restrictions?
6335
Well, what immediately catches my attention is this enormous book.
6335
I wonder how it squares with your size restriction?
6335
My Unabridged Sassacre's!
6335
It's a very rare edition, and a precious family heirloom, so I don't know if it would make an ideal candidate for the journey.
6335
But what if it gets damaged!
6335
Oh! Silly me, what was I even worried about!
6335
That wasn't even a Freudian slip.
6335
Doctor Freud just tripped over an errant phallus, tumbled down a flight of stairs, and broke his neck.
6335
And then his cigar exploded comically in his face.
6335
It was spectacular.
6335
Couldn't we send Wise Guy instead?
6335
At least it can be easily replaced.
6335
?
6335
HM??
6335
No, I reject your proposal that we "fuck" Wise Guy, whatever that actually means, or for that matter, the spelling of any adorable rodents named after African nations.
6335
I don't... think so?
6335
About what?
6335
I am not being a tightass!
6335
Oh god dammit.
6335
Take the book! What do I care!!!
6335
I fail to see what offering up a priceless book for your wildly capricious science experiment has to do with my resolution to be less stingy with my beliefs, but alright.
6335
Yes, let's just get on with it.
6336
It worked!
6336
The book is gone!
6336
What is it?
6336
Did you receive the book?
6336
Don't tell me.
6336
The book is damaged somehow, isn't it?
6336
Sigh. Is it at least SOMEWHAT intact?
6336
Or was it completely incinerated in transit?
6336
I just KNEW we should have used Wise Guy. I can't believe this.
6336
Oh.
6336
Then what's the problem?
6336
Will you tell me what happened??
6354
About what?
6354
Yet another exploding game trap?
6354
Yes.
6354
But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.
6354
Why?
6354
She was probably just trying to protect me from the Batterwitch's latest assassination attempt.
6354
Sheesh, I can't believe you all finally got me saying "Batterwitch" too. Who would have thought?
6354
What? Really?
6354
...
6354
Why would she do that?
6354
But...
6354
If she felt so strongly that I shouldn't play, she could have told me.
6354
Or, told me more forcefully, I guess. I would have listened!
6354
Maybe.
6354
:(
6354
Maybe she was justified in taking such an extreme measure. I sure hadn't been taking her seriously.
6354
She even warned me not to play it until she got back, but I went ahead anyway because I was too impatient!
6354
Actually...
6354
Now that I think about it, she was probably going to disarm it or such when she got back, seeing as her objective had essentially been accomplished already by an ACTUAL assassination attempt.
6354
After that, I told her I would believe her about everything.
6354
That probably made her feel guilty about setting me up, so she told me not to touch the file until she returned.
6354
But then I went ahead and ran it anyway like a doofus.
6354
I think she just wanted to be believed.
6354
Shucks.
6354
Am I an awful friend?
6354
I'm not so sure about that.
6354
Heh!
6354
You're right.
6354
I guess that's a pretty apt metaphor, even though it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.
6354
I just wanted to start playing the game so badly!
6354
Now more than ever. I have reason to believe the stakes have increased dramatically.
6354
I think our dream counterparts are all marked for death, and if we are to stand a chance, we must move quickly.
6354
Oh, she told you already?
6354
Um.
6354
Are you being ironic again?
6354
Dersite? You mean the other planet? The evil one?
6354
What did the story say about me?
6354
I didn't realize you had woken up in the game already.
6354
When did that happen?
6354
I guess I shouldn't act surprised you didn't tell me. What with all your highfalutin secrecy.
6354
Pretending? Why?
6354
I'm still not sure I'm following.
6354
Why are you maintaining the appearance of being asleep? On Prospit, it seemed as if the people there regarded me and Jake very highly. Like celebrated figures.
6354
Is it not the same way on Derse?
6354
In other words, read newspapers, get a feel for "the word on the street," and such?
6354
As might a detective? :B
6354
You mean... secret agents??
6354
Who's that?
6355
I guess I should find all that ominous.
6355
But I cannot lie, sir.
6355
Nothing you have said has made me one iota less excited to begin this adventure!
6355
Those dastardly agents can try to assassinate me all they like. I just want to get started!
6355
Right.
6355
Still fixing to pull the strings for us, per your extensive puppet metaphor?
6355
Hrm.
6355
Alrighty, I think I can make that concession.
6355
Sounds like a plan.
6355
I do hope she comes around. It would be a bummer to play without her.
6355
Say, do I even have any machines that survived the explosion besides this one?
6355
I guess not. :p
6355
Still, some nice things were surely destroyed.
6355
I think Detective Pony was caught in the blast.
6355
It's unlikely Acorn survived. :'(
6355
So, since I'm apparently out of "neutral devices,"
6355
Which computer is Seb installing the file on?
6356
Gotcha.
6356
My poor dad.
6356
He surely heard the explosion. I've put him through so much today.
6356
Oh no...
6356
I just had a dreadful thought.
6356
The kitchen is just below my room.
6356
What if he had begun baking his afternoon cake when my computer exploded?
6357
Maybe I should go look?
6357
Though I'm a little afraid to.
6358
I hope so.
6358
The Crockers have something of a legacy when it comes to losing forebears in mysterious explosions.
6358
I would be so sad if I kept the tradition alive like this.
6359
Ok.
6359
What are you doing?
6391
Heyyy.
6391
Ahem.
6391
Ro-Lal?
6391
Oh?
6391
With whom?
6392
Sigh.
6393
Oh god dammit.
6393
Take the book! What do I care!!!
6393
I fail to see what offering up a priceless book for your wildly capricious science experiment has to do with my resolution to be less stingy with my beliefs, but alright.
6393
Yes, let's just get on with it.
6400
It worked!
6400
The book is gone!
6400
What is it?
6400
Did you receive the book?
6400
Don't tell me.
6400
The book is damaged somehow, isn't it?
6454
About what?
6454
Yet another exploding game trap?
6454
Yes.
6454
But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.
6455
Ok.
6455
What are you doing?
6459
Wait...
6459
What?
6462
Oh gosh. Another large contraption!
6462
Okay.
6462
Say, what's with the red text, Dirk?
6462
Are you typing your most important instructions in red now?
6462
...
6463
Alrighty, I am in my father's study!
6463
I have kindly asked Mr. Sebastian to hand over the reins to this silly computer shaped like a man.
6463
What now?
6463
What?
6463
Who's right?
6463
:B
6470
Yes!
6470
Oh, wait.
6470
It's Roxy again.
6470
Can you hold on? I'll try to make it quick.
6471
:?
6471
I'm not sure that qualifies as innuendo at all.
6471
I honestly think you misspell things intentionally more often than not, regardless of blood alcohol content.
6471
You just typed wonk five times in a row!
6471
What is this urgent thing about, anyway?
6471
Is it about your boobytrap?
6471
Because you're too late. It already blew up my whole bedroom, thank you very much.
6471
Yes, me too. Right now in fact, and I'm in a bit of a hurry!
6471
What is this about? What are you even doing?
6471
Before what's too late?
6471
Oh my god.
6471
This isn't happening now...
6471
No! Cease your lascivious porcolating at once!
6471
Roxy, I can see you're set on just wasting more of my time.
6471
I understand if you don't wish to play this game, but please try not to interfere with those of us who do!
6471
My chance?
6471
What are you talking about?
6471
A move? You mean, a romantic one?
6471
On you?
6471
Um.
6471
On me?
6471
Oh.
6471
Ohhh.
6471
I didn't think...
6471
That...
6471
Hrm.
6471
Are you sure?
6471
Well then.
6471
This is quite a development.
6471
Poor Dirk!
6471
Well, surely when he reveals his feelings, Jake will...
6471
I mean...
6471
He couldn't possibly...
6471
Yes?
6471
Because Jake is not a homosexual!
6471
Are you saying he is?
6471
Then what are you saying?
6471
But...
6471
I thought it reasonable to presume he takes a shining to ladies.
6471
He does speak fondly of certain females from his favorite films, does he not?
6471
Well, now I just don't know. You have me completely bamboozled about this.
6471
What do you think?
6471
Okay. Then what does your acute seabeast scanner make of Jake, then?
6471
Oh brother.
6471
Then, your guess is as good as mine?
6471
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to conclude from this.
6471
Yes.
6471
But you just said you don't know!!!
6471
Oh, not this tightass baloney again.
6471
What?
6471
...
6471
No way!
6471
We settled this, remember?
6471
My prior resolution made it definitive; I was to be regarded as exceedingly permissive in certain respects!
6471
So ridiculous. >:P
6471
I promised to BELIEVE what you say, not DO it!
6471
If I agree to say something, will you stop tormenting me about it??
6471
Fine.
6471
But let the record show that this resolution has almost nothing whatsoever to do with your use of the phrase "SEX LAND."
6471
Just...
6471
I need to think of what to say, and wait for the right moment. Is that ok???
6471
Well,
6471
He does often profess his love for adventure, I suppose.
6471
Omg.
6471
I really don't have a moment to spare, do I?
6487
Jake!
6487
Hey there. I was actually about to message you.
6487
You did?
6487
Wait...
6487
What did she tell you?
6487
Did she goad you into writing this message?
6487
What ways?
6487
Provocative my behind!
6487
She is skirting dangerously close to meddlesome territory.
6487
??
6487
Has one of his gadgets been causing trouble for you over there as well?
6487
Deterred from what?
6487
Our stuff?
6487
Um...
6487
Yes.
6487
Okay.
6487
Have we?
6487
Is there something you want to say to me, Jake?
6487
About how you feel?
6487
...
6487
Go on.
6487
No, it's ok...
6487
Please continue!
6487
Uh.
6487
Wait...
6487
What?
6487
Wow, um.
6487
Well,
6487
I
6487
No!
6488
I guess...
6488
That...
6488
Sure was the thing I said! Ha ha.
6488
No!!!!!!
6488
Oh my God, what am I saying here?
6488
Jake, I didn't mean it! I didn't want to make you feel that way!
6488
...
6488
No? :(
6488
It is?
6488
You have?
6488
You would??
6488
Friends!
6488
Oh boy!!
6488
Everything else?
6488
I don't think I'm following.
6488
And mixed metaphors, apparently?
6488
I really don't, Jake.
6488
What?!
6489
What's happening?
6489
Jake, could you just tell me what you're talking about?
6489
Haha, yes!
6489
Friends!!!!
6489
Well what are friends for Jake!!!!!
6489
Me?
6489
HOO HOO HOO!
6489
I'm just
6489
Terrific!
6489
I'm feeling so...
6489
Friendly!!!
6489
I clearly just want to be a good friend and bring all my AMAZING FRIENDLINESS to bear on your problems.
6489
Friendlystyle! Ahahahah?
6489
Shit I mean
6489
Ahahahah!
6489
What?
6489
Courtship??
6489
Huh!
6489
Really?
6489
Yeaaah.
6489
What's inevitable?
6489
Uhhhhh...
6489
I don't think you have to do anything you don't want to, Jake.
6489
Wait.
6489
DO you not want to?
6489
Well...
6489
No.
6489
I don't think that makes you weird, Jake.
6489
I think
6489
That
6489
I think that it's great if you are open to exploring those feelings.
6490
Yes.
6490
As a matter of fact you have.
6490
Heh.
6490
Whee!
6490
Whoops!!
6490
Hmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6491
That is what I am good for, it seems!
6491
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
6491
Yeaaaaaaaah..........
6492
Say, Jake?
6492
Not to cast doubt on your feelings, but are you quite sure all of Dirk's actions have been for the sake of courtship?
6492
You did say his robot was prone to assailing you, did you not?
6492
Is that really an affectionate gesture?
6492
Oh.
6492
Yeah.
6492
I guess you're right.
6492
Yeah.
6492
I can see how such a complicated relationship could keep you preoccupied.
6492
I guess I can't blame you.
6492
Maybe you should just...
6492
I don't know.
6492
Maybe you should just go for it.
6492
Hell, why not.
6492
Just tell him you know how he feels and that you're open to the idea?
6493
...
6493
Yeah sure why the hell not.
6493
Well,
6493
He likes you.
6493
You seem to like him well enough.
6493
Just...
6493
Yes.
6493
Why not??
6493
Sounds good to me!!!
6493
And why would that be?!
6493
What, are you expecting me to advocate a more conservative approach?
6493
To tell you to keep being shy and cagey and keep beating around the bush indefinitely??
6493
What would ever give you that idea about me!
6493
I BELIEVE YOU WILL FIND THAT AS REFRESHING BOLDNESS GOES I AM SIMPLY THE BEST THERE IS.
6493
Screw it!
6493
Ask him out.
6493
Just kill the suspense already.
6493
Become boyfriends and such.
6493
Have some babies!!!
6493
Okay I think I have to go.
6493
I have this stupid game to play.
6494
Get this shit out of my face.
6494
Whatever.
6494
I don't want to talk about it, and if I did, I sure wouldn't want to talk about it with you!
6494
I just want to go to sleep and not wake up forever.
6721
Oh, hello.
6721
Did what, exactly?
6721
Sure.
6721
Yes. Sorry. I'm still feeling a little overwhelmed by what just happened.
6721
A giant pit seems to have swollen my house whole! My dad is missing too. I think I should try to find him as soon as possible.
6721
Ha ha, you call this grumpy?
6721
Not exactly!
6721
That's good.
6721
But wait...
6721
I thought you said you've never met him?
6721
Then how did he make a mess in there?
6721
Did he break into your room while you were asleep?
6721
Huh?
6721
Uh...
6721
Oh.
6721
It's rather desolate. Pretty eerie, actually.
6721
I haven't run into anyone at all. I think I might be alone here?
6721
The balloons are nice, I suppose.
6721
Yes. But what about your brother?
6721
Hey!
6722
Roxy!
6722
You won't believe where I am right now.
6722
Ok, maybe you will.
6722
But I'm in the game finally! It's considerably more outlandish than I was expecting.
6722
No, I was thinking...
6722
Well, I don't know. Something more like...
6722
THAT'S why you're contacting me???
6722
Roxy, please, I don't think you understand.
6722
There are MYSTERIES here.
6722
REAL MYSTERIES AND PUZZLES TO SOLVE.
6722
Groan.
6722
Hardly.
6722
If you really want to know, I completely blew it with him forever. Satisfied?
6722
He asked me if I liked him, and in the heat of the moment I panicked and said no.
6722
And then he went on this whole thing about Dirk, and...
6722
That's that.
6722
Can we drop it now?
6722
It's not a "love report!" Will you stop it?
6722
What? There's a fire?
6722
Oh, gosh.
6722
Please be careful!
6722
:(
6723
Jake! Wait!
6723
Oh no.
6726
Thank you!
6726
That last skull was a doozy, to be honest.
6726
Har har.
6726
Hey, I thought you couldn't see me once I left the house?
6726
Oh yeah?
6726
Blehhhh, why??
6726
That figure would be sitting pretty at one hundred percent.

Ok, let's stop talking about stupid things for a minute. What a completely absurd environment for our typical blithering discourse.
6726
I am hot on the prowl for more clues about this strange and mysterious land!
6726
What?
6726
Anyway, I think I'm getting closer to finding where my house went.
6726
Then I can reunite with dad, and together we can sleuth this great big pickle of a planet!
6726
Yes, I knew it!
6726
Oh no!
6726
Golly, why did he have to leave??
6726
This really complicates matters. I hope he doesn't get lost.
6726
Yes. Good idea.
6726
Got it! Thanks!
6734
AAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH!
6735
Hrm.
6735
Ok, I'm sorry for screaming there. That fellow over there just caught me quite off guard with this... uh... stunt.
6735
You seem quite upset. I think we should all try to calm down and figure out what to do.
6735
Um, yes. Well, first of all, my name is Jane. Pleased to meet you.
6735
What is yours?
6735
Oh dear.
6735
Quiet, you!
6735
This is all your fault. Look at what you've done!
6735
Hey, clown!
6735
Can't you do something? This poor creature shouldn't exist!
6856
What?
6856
Um.
6856
Oh!
6856
No!!
6856
I am not going to destroy my dad's car.
6856
There has to be a better way to gather up grist, though.
6856
No, and I can't say I'm too disappointed.
6856
Of course I have!
6856
Levels?
6856
I think I've done a fair job of scaling my echeladder without resorting to the slaughter of innocent, fictional monsters, thank you very much.
6856
I'm getting a little tired of various iterations of Dirk Strider telling me how I need to be more like Jake.
6856
I know you think Jake is neat. I know all the Dirks just ADORE Jake! I GET IT!
6856
You don't need to remind me about that. I'm suddenly having flashbacks to a few years ago when he would ambush me almost every day for a pointless round of strife.
6856
Boy does getting swatted with brooms and having cakes shoved in your face get old fast.
6856
Well. Yes.
6856
I am not going to spar with Lil Sebastian!!!
6856
He is too quick and deadly to fight with.
6856
And also, too adorable. :B
6856
You could be right.
6856
I will give it a try.
6861
Welp, let me have it!
6861
A hard time for botching up the pooch!
6861
I think I just locked the door with that muttonheaded stunt. And now that mirrored obelisk is good as gone.
6861
Oh brother.
6861
That is really, really robo-smart.
6861
Ok?
6861
Alright, I think I can do that.
6861
What should I do in the meantime?
6861
Oh stop it!
6861
None of our friends will answer me. What could they be up to?
6861
You must at least know what Dirk is doing.
6861
Some what?
6861
She's fighting robots too, you mean?
6861
Why?
6861
What? What issue!
6861
Are you sure she's not just trying to kill them?
6861
It wouldn't be her first assassination attempt.
6861
But it nearly worked!
6861
I would be dead right now if not for the whims of GCat.
6861
So, you're saying she's only pretending to hunt us?
6861
Then you're saying Dirk and Roxy aren't really in danger from the robots?
6861
Augh! I just want to talk to my friends and see if they're ok.
6861
What about Jake?
6861
Then I guess I'll just sit here and worry about everyone quietly until Seb gets back.
6861
What?
6861
Oh yeah!
6861
I forgot about her.
6861
But I suppose that's because she's always the one to contact me. I never get a response when I message her.
6861
You can do that??
6862
Hello?
6862
Are you there?
6862
Oh my! You answered!
6862
You never answer.
6862
Well, no. I don't mean to be accusatory.
6862
I am just surprised.
6862
Well... nothing in particular. Just thought it would be nice to catch up.
6862
I was beginning to think I was the only one of my friends left alive.
6862
Maybe this gloomy place full of salamander bones and dusty old relics is starting to get to me.
6862
Not to mention the most unwelcome presence of entrepreneurial clowns and their enormous codpieces.
6862
I'm still trying to track down my father. I've been gathering clues, and I may be getting close.
6862
Do you by any chance know if I might see him soon?
6862
Hmm...
6862
Are you there?
6862
Phew! That's nice to know. Thanks.
6862
You aren't usually forthcoming with future tidbits. Er, not that I was always especially eager to believe you about them anyway.
6862
But I think I've been coming around on that lately, for what it's worth.
6862
So, um.
6862
Hey.
6862
Are you ok there?
6862
You seem rather preoccupied.
6862
What's wrong?
6862
Is it your brother?
6862
That sounds awful!
6862
I had no idea things had gotten this grim for you. I am so sorry.
6862
Are you sure it's hopeless with him? You can't reach a truce, just for the sake of playing?
6862
I think you have alluded to this before, but I never really understood.
6862
What game?
6862
Try me!
6862
Of course not. I wrote off your reticence as one of your many eccentricities long ago.
6862
I still want to understand this game with your brother, though.
6862
Could you describe some of the other rules?
6862
Hemotyping?
6862
But your race has varied blood color?
6862
Then what would yours be?
6862
Jeez. Why?
6862
Are you saying you have such powers?
6862
But he does not?
6862
Maybe he is jealous of you, which is why there is such resentment?
6862
The way you described it, I had always envisioned your contentious relationship as one played out mostly online.
6862
And also that you and he had never met. Yet some things you have said lately appear to contradict this?
6862
I understand.
6862
That makes sense, but I'm not sure I see how it applies.
6862
:B
6862
<3
6862
You were??
6862
What is it? Or is it a surprise?
6862
Your juju?
6862
Where did you get it?
6862
Um... gosh.
6862
It sure sounds like you two are up to your necks in this crazy game.
6862
Not such a big fan of games?
6862
Um.
6862
Beauty?
6937
Really?
6937
What is it?
6937
Shucks!!!!!
6937
Ok, what do I do?
6937
Upgrades? What upgrades?
6937
Wait, is that how this stupid "Delirious Biznasty" application got on here?
6937
Why?
6937
Sheesh.
6937
Very well then, Mister Zipperlips.
6937
Whatever! Let's curtail the horseplay this once while I help Roxy.
6937
Ok. I installed it. Now what? Should I run it?
6937
Okey dokey. Doing that now.
6937
Hey, I can see her room! :B
6938
That's a really nice room there.
6938
But where is she?
6938
Hah, her drink is still there. So she can't have gone far.
6938
I don't see her anywhere in the rest of the house.
6938
I see plenty of plush wizards and window gizmos, and... pumpkins? Really, Roxy?
6938
What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?
6938
I just tried messaging her. But no response.
6938
She said things were on fire when we last talked?
6938
Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.
6938
But judging by the view from her window, it looks lovely outside.
6938
What exactly is the danger I am saving her from here?
6939
OH NO!!!!!
6939
Roxy, where are you??? :(
6939
How do you know she's not hurt?
6939
Then what is?
6939
Oh...
6939
Yes.
6939
What IS that??
6940
Right. Let's see.
6940
There's hardly any space in here to put anything. I'll have to make some room.
6940
I don't want to damage any of her belongings though.
6941
WHOOPS!
6941
Dag nabbit. This trackpad is AWFUL!
6941
Lousy dad computer.
6941
Why does he have to buy his computers at the Dadly Depot?
6941
Why does he have to buy EVERYTHING at the Dadly Depot?
6941
I really need to keep looking for him soon. Thinking about our expeditions to the Dadly Depot is making me miss him.
6942
There. Those seem like suitable locations for the equipment.
6942
Hey, where's Lil Seb?
6942
I think he went through the door.
6943
He just disappeared on that platform!
6943
I think it might be some kind of transport device, that works via teleportation.
6943
A kind of "transportalizer," to coin a completely silly and novel term.
6943
But I think that's where my dad went too!
6943
I have to follow him.
6944
It'll be fine!
6944
I'm bringing my computer with me. I can tend to Roxy's entry along the way.
6981
Hey! Where are you??
6981
I can't find you anywhere in your crazy house.
6981
It's just wizards and pumpkins as far as the eye can see.
6981
I hope you're ok!
6981
Please get back to me as soon as you can.
7421
Oh. Hello, Jake.
7421
Um, not really? Roxy and I are just setting a few things up here.
7421
No, it's fine! It's really nice to hear from you, actually.
7421
I was starting to worry you might have forgotten.
7421
Oh no...
7422
Never mind.
7422
No, Jake.
7422
We didn't need your help raiding a tomb. But thanks for thinking of us.
7422
I don't know what this clueless pair of damsels would do without you.
7422
Yes. It has to do with the day I was born, which was almost exactly sixteen years ago.
7422
Didn't you get Roxy's invitation?
7422
It was my understanding that she gave you and Dirk notice weeks ago.
7422
Mm.
7422
Jake. I... what?
7422
Well, if you recall, the party is actually tomorrow.
7422
Like I said, we're just setting a few things up.
7422
Roxy is putting up some decorations. I baked a cake. You were of course free to join us early too. I just thought since I hadn't heard from you in quite some time, you had better things to do.
7422
Yes. So?
7422
Jake, what was it you actually wanted?
7422
Mmm.
7422
...
7423
It's been more like five months.
7423
Mmhmm.
7423
Yes.
7423
Many times.
7423
Mmhmm.
7423
Mm.
7423
That's nice, Jake. I'm kind of busy though.
7423
What did you actually want to talk to me about?
7423
Actually, why don't we just talk about it tomor-
7424
You don't say.
7424
Mm.
7424
Mmmm!
7424
Mmhmm.
7424
Hmm!
7425
Jake.
7425
Jake.
7425
Jake!!!
7425
Shut up!
7425
Shut up!!!
7426
JAKE.
7426
PLEASE.
7426
STOP TALKING.
7426
JAKE.
7426
I SAID SHUT UP.
7426
JUST,
7426
SHUT,
7426
THE FUCK,
7426
UUUUUUUUUUP!!!
7427
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
7427
WHAT'S THE MATTER???
7427
I AM SICK.
7427
AND FUCKING TIRED.
7427
TO DEATH.
7427
OF YOUR INSUFFERABLE BLITHERING BULLSHIT!!!!!!
7427
I AM SHOUTING!
7427
THERE ARE LITERAL SHOUTS OF ANGER COMING OUT OF MY ACTUAL MOUTH, AND THEY ARE DIRECTED AT YOU!
7427
OH MY GOD. WHY ARE YOU SO CLUELESS?
7427
I CAN'T STAND IT!
7427
IT'S NOT ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY!!!
7427
THE FACT THAT YOU FORGOT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP, BUT THAT'S NOT IT. SEE, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!
7427
OH, AND COULD YOU PLEASE STOP SAYING SHUCKS BUSTER?!
7427
SHUCKS BUSTER WAS MY THING! AND YOU STOLE IT!
7427
NO, IT WAS MY THING, BUT I ALLOWED IT TO BE OUR THING! BACK WHEN YOU USED TO GIVE A SHIT! BUT NOW IT'S JUST MINE, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE!
7427
.................
7428
JAKE, LET ME ASK YOU.
7428
DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE TALKED?
7428
NO. TRY A FEW WEEKS AGO!
7428
AND EVEN THEN, YOU MESSAGED ME JUST TO TALK ABOUT SOME STUPID SHIT THAT HAPPENED WITH DIRK.
7428
A TEDIOUS GESTURE WHICH YOU THEN SAW FIT TO REPRISE ON MY BIRTHDAY OF ALL DAYS, WHILST CONSIDERATELY FORGETTING ABOUT IT!
7428
AND EVEN WHEN I REMINDED YOU ABOUT IT, YOU STILL BARGED AHEAD WITH YOUR SELF-INDULGENT RELATIONSHIP CLAPTRAP ANYWAY!
7428
YEAH! THAT'S BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME WE CHAT, YOU DO NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT YOURSELF!
7428
YOU NEVER ASK ME HOW I'M FEELING OR WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO. YOU JUST LAUNCH INTO YOUR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS, AND I JUST LISTEN LIKE AN ACCOMMODATING FOOL AS ALWAYS!
7428
SO I JUST STOPPED BOTHERING! WHY SHOULD I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THAT REPEATEDLY?!
7428
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE MOST THOUGHTLESS, SELF-CENTERED PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!
7428
I CAN'T BELIEVE I USED TO FEEL...
7428
JAKE, HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU HOW IT MUST FEEL FOR SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HER FRIEND GO ON AND ON ABOUT HIS BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS WHEN...
7428
WHEN ALL ALONG SHE...
7428
BUT SHE JUST COULDN'T SAY BECAUSE SHE BLEW IT AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO...
7428
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M BOTHERING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. NEVER MIND.
7428
YEAH. I...
7428
I know. :(
7429
RAAARARRAAUUUAAAAUUAGHGHGGHGGGGHHGH!
7430
NO!
7430
YOU AREN'T COMING TO MY PARTY!
7430
YOU AREN'T COMING TO MY PARTY, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A PARTY!
7430
GO RAID SOME TOMBS WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND. GO MAKE OUT WITH HIM OR BREAK UP WITH HIM, OR WHATEVER IT IS YOUR FICKLE, SELFISH HEART DESIRES!
7430
I AM AT THE END OF MY ROPE WITH YOU!
7430
I AM FED UP WITH YOUR STUPID MOVIES AND YOUR STUPID ADVENTURES AND YOUR STUPID OLD TIMEY CHARMS AND YOU STUUUUUUPID DASHING GOOD LOOKS. WHO NEEDS ANY OF IT?????
7430
OH, WILL YOU PLEASE,
7430
JUST,
7431
STFU BUSTER!!!!!!!!!
7432
I WILL BE PEACHY FUCKING KEEN ONCE I STOMP THIS NOVELTY MUSTACHE HEADSET INTO OBLIVION, AND NOT A MOMENT SOONER!
7432
AU CONTRAIRE.
7432
I BELIEVE YOU WILL FIND THAT ONCE THIS PIECE OF SHIT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO SUBATOMIC PARTICLES, WE WILL ALL COME OUT SMELLING LIKE FUCKING ROSES.
7433
OH POOR FEFETA MY SWEET PATOOTIE!
7433
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW FEFETA HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH GARBAGE FROM JERKOFF BOYS BEFORE.
7433
SO DON'T GIVE ME THIS POOR FEFETA CRAP.
7433
SIGH.
7433
FINE.
7433
SHHHHHHHH!
7434
NO, I WAS SERIOUS!
7434
I'M NOT...
7434
I'm not in the mood for a party anymore.
7434
>:(
7434
Yeah, me too. Can we maybe not rehash the whole terrible conversation though??
7434
>:(
7434
ROXY, PLEASE.
7434
AS IF THAT ISN'T THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND RIGHT NOW!
7434
I AM SO DONE WITH THAT WHOLE TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
7434
YESSIREE!
7434
IF JAKE'S THE RAINBOW, THEN JUST CALL ME A LITTLE HOUSE FROM KANSAS!
7434
WHEEEEEE!
7434
MMMMMMMHM!!!
7434
WAIT...
7434
WHAT??
7435
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN???
7435
WAS IT REALLY?!
7435
ROXY, I GET YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER, BUT A LOT OF THINGS YOU'RE SAYING HERE AREN'T REALLY HELPING!
7435
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HALF THE TIME?
7435
I THINK I LIKED YOU BETTER WHEN YOU WERE DRINKING!
7435
OK, YEAH!
7435
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE THERE AND I'M SORRY!
7435
THAT STUPID CONVERSATION WITH JAKE JUST PUSHED ME OVER SOME KIND OF EDGE AND NOW I AM FEELING REALLY, REALLY DISTRAUGHT!
7435
THIS GAME IS SO MUCH MORE DEPRESSING THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE! EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND EMPTY AND FULL OF GRAVES AND ALL WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IS JUST KEEP WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING! BUT FOR HOW MUCH LONGER? AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE MY DAD IS, AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH CALLIOPE, AND WHAT IF THEY'RE BOTH...
7435
AND NOW ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I MAY HAVE PERMANENTLY DESTROYED MY FRIENDSHIP WITH JAKE!
7435
AND NOW...
7435
Now...
7435
I just want to be alone.
7435
I have to go!
7436
HOME!!!
7451
What the?
7451
Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.
7451
You are the absolute last person I want to hear from right now.
7451
And the bottom of that list is pretty competitive territory at the moment!
7451
I don't want us to become friends!
7451
We all thought you were gone for good. And we liked it that way!
7451
Please don't tell me you've found a second wind of petty trolling in you.
7451
Whatever. And what's with the ugly green text?
7451
Reading your malformed sentence fragments was unpleasant enough as it was.
7451
"Whom" you can see, moron.
7451
And no, you can't!
7451
Calliope said you couldn't see us at all in our game session. So I think you're lying!
7452
Oh, dear God.
7452
WHY???
7452
How wonderful for you.
7452
I don't care how all-seeing and all-powerful you think you are.
7452
If your intent is to waste my time with more of your pitiful bullying, you are out of luck.
7452
Because that is exactly NOT the sort of crap I am in the mood for today.
7452
Toodle-oo!!!
7452
??
7453
Hrm.
7453
Nope. That makes very little sense.
7453
Yes, I see it all too clearly now. You're really quite the charmer!
7453
Uh huh.
7453
So you're actually trying to claim that you find me attractive, from the alleged "bad means good" point of view of your hate-driven species?
7453
Eww.
7453
You pig.
7453
Excuse me??
7453
Oh, that's just great.
7453
The ONE TIME we had a generic girly pillow fight, and it turns out some pervert was watching us.
7453
I think I need a shower.
7453
Assuming I can ever take one again in peace!
7453
What?
7453
...
7453
Really?
7453
What do you mean, exactly...
7453
By "clout?"
7453
Do you mean...
7453
My...
7453
Why am I even having this conversation!
7453
What? No!
7453
Are you insane?
7453
I don't care where you are, or whatever the hell it is you "unlocked" to spy on me.
7453
You aren't allowed to sit there all day leering at my boobs!!!
7453
My... what?
7453
Wait, what were YOU talking about?
7453
Screw you!
7453
Tell me what you were getting at with all that!!
7453
The stuff about "clout," and my "bulbous locations."
7453
Spacetime??
7453
WHAT!
7453
SHUT UP!
7453
I'M NOT FAT!!!
7453
GO FUCK YOURSELF!
7453
Oh cripes.
7453
What is it?
7453
Oh goodness, no. You poor delusional thing.
7453
I don't care what progress you think you've made. You will never be a good artist, dear.
7453
Groan.
7454
That is the most pointless and incomprehensible load of drivel I have ever read.
7454
Your "portrait" is every bit as abysmal as I was expecting. And for the last time. I AM NOT FAT.
7454
I think your claims of attraction to heavyset women, which you present as "flattery," is an obvious ruse to get me to feel insecure about my appearance, and it isn't going to work!
7454
SHUT YOUR STUPID FACE!!!
7454
UGH, THIS BIRTHDAY IS SO AWFUL! I CAN'T STAND IT!
7454
WHY IS EVERYONE TREATING ME LIKE SHIT TODAY?
7454
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?!
7454
SHUT UP!
7454
I'M DONE HUMORING YOUR PERVERTED ADOLESCENT MIND GAMES!
7454
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO CALLIOPE!
7454
CALLIOPE!!!
7454
WE WANT YOU BACK! PLEASE COME BACK AND SPARE US FROM THIS LECHEROUS NINCOMPOOP!
7454
CALLIOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7454
WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK?!
7454
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
7454
NO!!! THAT CAN'T BE TRUE! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE EVEN YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE!
7454
WHAT?? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY FATHER!
7454
WHERE IS HE?
7454
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN!!!
7454
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
7454
Ok...
7454
So he's on Derse, then?
7454
And I suppose you have??
7454
No. Don't say that. Shut up!
7455
YOU BASTARD! I SAID SHUT UP!!!
7455
STOP IT
7455
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!!!
7456
FUCK YOU! HE'S NOT DEAD!
7456
MY DAD'S FINE, I'M NOT FAT, AND I HATE YOU! I'M NEVER TALKING TO YOU AGAIN!!!!!!
7456
AND STOP WATCHING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7690
What.
7691
What.
7692
I think it fell into the crypt.
7693
I think it fell into the crypt.
7696
Ha.
7696
In the interest of appeasing the irony gods, let's go with the latter.
7696
Oh lord. The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid "sweet sixteen".
7696
What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.
7696
And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.
7696
And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!
7696
Haha. Thanks, Calliope.
7696
Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.
7696
I understand.
7696
Boy, you really let him have it back there!
7696
I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.
7696
At least, it did at the time.
7696
I only wish I could have stayed as lucid as you during our...
7696
Transformation.
7696
How did you manage that?
7696
Okay.
7696
So instead of keeping my cool like you, I just started gushing over him like a lovestruck loon, surrendering any sliver of dignity I might have earned by telling him off earlier.
7696
I just cannot believe some of the things I said. Oh God. I told him I wanted to get married and have babies!!!
7696
I know! But...
7696
It's one thing to write off something you say to an altered state of mind. But what makes the admission so mortifying to me is...
7696
I actually MEANT it.
7696
And I'm sure he must know that by now.
7696
And now I feel so humiliated I just want to die.
7696
I would ask him to shoot me right here, if I could bring myself to say a word to him.
7696
Woo!!!
7696
We are all such WINNERS.
7697
Ha.
7697
In the interest of appeasing the irony gods, let's go with the latter.
7697
Oh lord. The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid "sweet sixteen".
7697
What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.
7697
And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.
7697
And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!
7697
Haha. Thanks, Calliope.
7697
Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.
7697
I understand.
7697
Boy, you really let him have it back there!
7697
I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.
7697
At least, it did at the time.
7697
I only wish I could have stayed as lucid as you during our...

7697
Woo!!!
7697
We are all such WINNERS.
7698
Tell me about it.
7698
Same.
7698
But I always felt you had the advantage over me too!
7698
Because you're... YOU.
7698
You make things happen, and I don't.
7698
It doesn't really. But that's fine. :B
7698
Clearly we both used some poor judgment.
7698
Looking back, it seems crazy to me that we both jeopardized our friendship over a mutual infatuation with, let's face it, one spectacularly goofy kid.
7698
YES.
7698
Yeah. That might have saved us a lot of grief.
7698
It's not like I hate him now, even though that's probably what he thinks. He's still my friend.
7698
But the extent to which I centered my whole life around a childish fantasy about him is just painfully embarrassing in hindsight.
7698
I wonder if I'll ever be able to look at him again without feeling miserable about myself?
7698
Me neither. :\
7698
Perhaps.
7698
Or maybe we just don't need anybody.
7698
As anything other than friends, I mean.
7699
Tell me about it.
7699
Same.
7699
But I always felt you had the advantage over me too!
7699
Because you're... YOU.
7699

7702
Why would you think that?
7703
Why would you think that?
7716
Is everything ok?
7716
I... see.
7716
That's ok.
7716
You were saying?
7716
Yes.
7716
Actually, once you did stop, it made me finally realize it was a problem for you for a long time.
7716
And I didn't say anything at the time, but it made me wonder if I wasn't doing the right thing before.
7716
By failing to point out you might have a problem? Or just going along with it and participating in lively banter any time you clearly had too much to drink?
7716
Was I just being a bad friend?
7717
Is everything ok?
7717
I... see.
7717
That's ok.
7717
You were saying?
7717
Yes.
7717

7717
Was I just being a bad friend?
7718
But it turned out you couldn't bring her back. At least not the way you thought.
7718
So what was it that made you finally decide to give it up?
7718
Dear, sweet, precious Fefeta!
7719
But it turned out you couldn't bring her back. At least not the way you thought.
7719
So what was it that made you finally decide to give it up?
7719
Dear, sweet, precious Fefeta!
7720
The whole place was shaking for a moment there.
7721
The whole place was shaking for a moment there.
7722
No, it stopped.
7722
I don't know. Maybe an earthquake?
7723
No, it stopped.
7723
I don't know. Maybe an earthquake?
7724
Yes.
7724
No, not at all.
7725
Yes.
7725
No, not at all.
7728
I remember.
7728
You said I would be the leader of our team, in name and in spirit.
7728
Although I never really felt like it.
7729
I remember.
7729
You said I would be the leader of our team, in name and in spirit.
7729
Although I never really felt like it.
7734
I think that would be nice.
7734
Of course, she IS right there, you know.
7735
I think that would be nice.
7735
Of course, she IS right there, you know.
7736
Uh, Dirk...
7736
Something's happening.
7737
Uh, Dirk...
7737
Something's happening.
7738
The tremors are back.
7738
BIG TIME.
7739
The tremors are back.
7739
BIG TIME.
7780
Me?
7780
Oh.
7780
I...
7780
Yes.
7780
Yes.
7781
Me?
7781
Oh.
7781
I...
7781
Yes.
7781
Yes.
7804
OBEY.
7805
OBEY.

SUBMIT.
8242
.
8298
Silence, buster.
8299
Obviously.
8299
Because when it comes to the affairs of my empire, I am all business.
8299
You see, Kanaya. I am a businesswoman.
8299
A very shrewd one at that.
8299
Watch and learn, rainbow drinker.
8340
It is just you and I now, Jake.
8340
Alone at last.
8341
The what.
8341
Absolutely not.
8342
Jake. Be quiet.
8342
Having recently been crowned a supreme being of pure logic, my tolerance for your antiquated horseshit has fallen to nil.
8342
Argh!
8342
Jake, now you have done it.
8342
You have made me exclaim in frustration audibly.
8342
If your intent is to welcome another knuckle sandwich instead of my reasoning for your captivity, then go on. Say ONE MORE THING that sounds like something a corny old man would say.
8342
I dare you.
8342
That's what I thought.
8343
Listen carefully, prisoner.
8343
I stand to inherit a new empire very soon.
8343
When Earth has reached its final destination, it will be repopulated with a fresh brood of loyal subjects over whom I will rule absolutely.
8343
But I will not rule alone, Jake. Oh, no. I will need a husband to rule by my side.
8343
That is where you come in.
8343
You and I will be wed, and we will rule my empire together with an iron oven mitt.
8343
However, the mitt will be worn by me, and me alone. You will have no executive authority whatsoever, because you are too stupid.
8343
You will always do exactly what I say, when I say it. You will be obedient, cheerful, mostly silent, and scantily clad. Is that understood?
8343
You will also provide me with children so my imperial legacy will continue, and the Crocker brand will live on in infamy.
8343
You will sire as many children as I ask for, and they will all be perfect, obedient little heirs and heiresses.
8343
You do remember our recent agreement to have "a zillion babies," don't you, Jake? I do hope you were not planning to renege on this vow.
8343
Our children will rule the empire when we are gone, which of course will be never, because we will be eternally young and beautiful and immortal and in love, for ever and ever.
8343
We will travel the galaxy conquering planets and expanding my empire. No alien world will pose any resistance to our forces.
8343
Especially not once I figure out how to unlock all that incredible "Page of Hope potential" hidden away in your pathetic, hunky body.
8344
Jake.
8344
JAKE.
8344
To whom are you talking?
8344
Brain... Ghost Dirk?
8344
You are lying.
8344
Brain Ghost Dirk sounds almost as fake as he is completely made up.
8344
Oh, for goodness' sake.
8345
Pull yourself together, Jake.
8345
Your behavior is repugnant, and has no place in my empire.
8345
What kind of man are you?
8345
What kind of suitor to an heiress weeps uncontrollably when his imaginary friend's existence is called into question?
8345
Punch WHOM in the face, now?
8345
Just sickening.
8345
To think I wasted my youth pining over a vile maggot like you.
8345
Jake, you should not be misled when I imply that I love you, or when I command you to marry me and sire my children.
8345
In truth I detest you, and if not for certain assets you possess, I would be sorely tempted to fork you full of holes right now and feed your remains to my daughter.
8345
.
8345
.
8345
.
8345
But I won't.
8346
You're lucky you're so hot.
8470
Crocker to Harley.
8470
Come in Harley.
8470
Do you read me?
8470
I suggest that you come to Derse right away.
8471
We potentially have a problem here that is rather significant in size.
8487
I don't know.
8487
When I arrived, it was already parked here.
8487
Most illegally, I might add.
8487
If you really wanted to relocate the vehicle, couldn't you just.
8487
You know. Teleport it somewhere else?
8487
Indeed.
8487
But observing adorable creatures issue citations will not address our problem.
8488
I would rather not involve her in this matter.
8488
We should be more than sufficiently equipped to handle it.
8488
She would think we were a couple of silly children.
8488
What?
8488
That would be a logical course of action.
8488
What?
8506
JAKE. CEASE POWERING UP AT ONCE.
8506
YOU'RE DESTROYING EMPIRE PROPERTY!
8507
Who are you?
8509
Harley.
8509
You deal with Jake.
8509
I will subdue the smug troll.
8516
What's the hold up?
8516
So I have overheard.
8516
Jake, your righteous ascension has been quite impressive.
8516
But that is incredibly annoying.
8516
Oh, for Pete's sake.
8517
What game are you playing, troll?
8517
State your designs on my future husband.
8517
You will do no such thing.
8517
.
8517
.
8517
My calculations say that it is highly probable you are enticing me into a trap.
8517
More immortal than usual??
8517
.
8517
.
8517
.
8517
That's stupid.
8517
Good gravy.
8517
Can't you shut him up?
8542
JAKE.
8542
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DONE TO OUR BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER?
8542
YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL. COME TO YOUR SENSES THIS INSTANT.
8542
Wait.
8542
Do what??
8557
First of all.
8558
You've got some nerve.
8559
I will return shortly to annihilate you. Stay put.
8563
(Mumble mumble hag mumble suck it grumble.)
8564
(Mumble mutter my egregious patootie.)
8565

8565
?
8582
GET YOUR PAWS OFF ME YOU SHITFUCKING SHITFUCKER AUGH FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK FUCK.
8582
YOU SCURRILOUS FUCKSHITTING CAD. UNHAND ME SO I MAY RESURRECT MY ACCOMPLICE AT ONCE.
8583
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME THIS TIME YOU DETESTABLE POO ROGERING CHARLATAN.
8583
I DO NOT WANT TO BUY ANYMORE OF YOUR POTIONS. I ALREADY BOUGHT ALL THE USELESS SLOP I COULD EVER WANT FROM YOU, AND MADE A KILLING ON REDISTRIBUTION.
8583
YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL TACTICS LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED. YOU ARE A DEPLORABLE BUSINESSMAN AND AN EVEN SHITTIER CLOWN. GET OFF ME.
8583
DID YOU JUST TOUCH MY BOOB. DON'T TOUCH MY BOOB YOU FUCKFACED DUNG HUFFING TOILET GUZZLING IDIOT QUIPSTER SHITPECKER DICKLARK.
8611
Observing this tomfoolery for several minutes has been time well spent. I have no regrets whatsoever.
8611
On that authentic note, I shall resume my effort to resurrect my omnipotent daughter, and regain the tactical advantage.
8611
As a being of cold, flawless reason and logic, I have no cause to anticipate further impediments to this simple objective.
8612
Son of a dick.
8619
NO, YOU IDIOT!
8620
Oh, you idiots.
8620
You stupid, stupid dogs.
8620
I AM TRYING TO REVIVE HER!!!
8622
Fine.
8622
If that is how you are going to be...
8623
You leave me with no alternative.
8630
No, come back!
8630
You were supposed to drop her first.
8630
MY CALCULATIONS SAID YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DROP HER FIRST!
8630
Yes.
8632
.
8633
Hot mom?
8664
Forgive me, Jake.
