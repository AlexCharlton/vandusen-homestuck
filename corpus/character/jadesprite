there is nothing but death and sadness and destruction here
5145
theres no hope, and i dont see anything worth fighting for
5145
i dont belong here anyway
5145
really none of this is my business anymore and i want to go home

5827

5827
oh yeah
5827
im supposed to help jade too, but......
5827
*sniffle*
5827

5827
you were saying?
5827
the forge?
5827
ohhh
5827
i did?
5827
yeah
5827
shes a lot more brave than me i think
5827
she brought me back thinking i could help her and all i did was disappoint her and everyone else
5827
you came back as a sprite and youre managing to do important things...
5827
but i just feel so scared and helpless
5827
i dont know if i would have if i had the chance
5827
but i would like to not feel so useless to everybody
5827
what about your sword? isnt it important?
5827
im still not sure how you got it...
5827
what does it have to do with my volcano?
5844
but i thought the denizens were supposed to be asleep?
5844
at least until you do the right things on your quest...
5844
what choice
5844
what did you choose?
5844
what happened when you saw him this time?
5844
you mean Choice!
5844
hehehe :p
5844
oops
5844
so it was the same choice?
5845
then what did he make you decide?
5845
as opposed to what?
5845
oh...
5845
yeah ._.
5845
probably something amazing
5845
she is still working so hard to help everyone
5845
i guess i used to be that way...
5845
but ive completely forgotten how
5846
whats happening?
5846
can we do something to stop it?
5846
i dont know.....
5846
i like it here though
5846
i felt like i was drawn to come here when i wasnt sure where to go
5846
the meteors
5846
and all the fire...
5846
it reminds me of when i died
5846
and i was trying to wake john up
5846
i was scared then too
5846
but i didnt let the fear stop me from trying to save him
5846
i have no idea
5846
i guess try to help
5846
what is there to do?
5846
oh noo
5846
does that mean youre going to leave?
5846
:(
5846
you mean...
5846
that i should give him the sword?
5846
but i dont want to leave you here either
5846
oh yeah!
5846
alright, i will try.....
