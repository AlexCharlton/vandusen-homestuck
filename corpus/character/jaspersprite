Meow.
3526
Purr purr purr.
3526
Purrrrrrrrrr.
3526
:3
3526
Meow.
3526
Im fishing!
3526
But sadly there are no fish i think.
3526
They were all eaten by the Denizen!
3526
It ate everything in the ocean and got so full that it took a long nap.
3526
No there is surely not a single living thing left!
3526
Which is too bad because im pretty hungry.
3526
Oh good idea i will look there!
3526
Purr purr.
3526
Meow.
3526
:3
3526
You will understand when you wake up!
3526
Yes!
3526
Rose im just a cat and i dont know much but i know that youre important and also you are what some people around here call the Seer of Light.
3526
And you dont know what that means but you will see its all tied together!
3526
All the life in the ocean and all the shiny rain and the songs in your head and the letters they make.
3526
A beam of light i think is like a drop of rain or a long piece of yarn that dances around when you play with it and make it look enticing!
3526
And the way that it shakes is the same as what makes notes in a song!
3526
And a song i think can be written down as letters.
3526
So if you play the right song and it makes all the right letters then those letters could be all the letters that make life possible.
3526
So all you have to do is wake up and learn to play the rain!
3526
Does that make sense rose sorry i disappeared for so long.
3526
Purr purr purrrrrrrr.
4716
Hi rose!
4716
Purr purr purr.
4716
Really rose ok if thats what you want i will go do that.
4716
Oh rose!
4716
Rose did you get to do any of the things that are important to your quest that i said?
4716
Did you learn to play the rain rose?
4716
Meow what :3
4716
Oh thats ok rose i wouldnt want you to feel obligated to do that.
4716
I think that winning this game and getting the prize is up to you and your friends.
4716
You get to decide whether or not you feel its right to do that and what kind of prize you want to make!
4716
Its part of becoming who youre supposed to become i think.
4716
But i really think you should consider going on the quest i said anyway!
4716
Because its not just an important thing to do to win the game.
4716
I dont know i hope im not being too pushy rose its not my place to be im just your cat!
4716
But the thing that made me how i am now seems to really want me to say this to you.
4716
Your quest is really important for you to do.
4716
Not really because thats how to get the prize.
4716
But because its what you need to do for yourself!
4716
Oh good!
4716
I love you rose! I always have even when you were a little girl and i was an alive cat.
4716
It was fun getting to be your cat again rose even if it was just for a little while and also while being a princess ghost.
4716
Bye rose!
4716
Ok I will do that! :3
5794
Why nepeta?
5794
Whats a timeline? :3
5794
Yes! Oh yes so great.
5794
Meow yes i see the sky and can tell that indeed something is going on.
5794
But aside from that i dont really understand what you said being a cat and all.
5794
Purr purr i still think its nice how you slip cat things in the things you say youre so clever and wonderful nepeta!
5794
Whats the scratch? :3
5794
Yes of course!
5794
Yes. :3
5794
I think i understand that completely!
5794
Im not worried nepeta so you shouldnt either its not as if i have never died before.
5794
Pounce was a cat like me?
5794
Ooh i bet youre right! Purr purr.
5794
Was she nice to sniff?
5794
Wow!
5794
Rose!!!!! I loved rose. :3
5794
There was a time i remember i was thinking about girl cats a lot for some reason.
5794
I would saunter around the house making all these big meows and looking out the windows with my nose touching the glass.
5794
But then roses mom took me to this place where i was scared to be for a while and then when i was at home again i didnt do the meows anymore.
5794
I guess i didnt think about the girl cats after that which is just as well because none ever came to the windows really not even when i did my biggest meows.
5794
Youre really nice to say so nepeta what about you though?
5794
Yes. :3
5794
What dont you tell him?
5794
Maybe you can win his affection by rubbing your cheek against him thats what i would do.
5794
Whats a quadrant?
5794
:3
5794
Like paws?
5794
I see thats really easy to get.
5794
I think you should tell him that you like him you might not get the chance if you dont.
5794
For instance i think instead of meowing at windows i should have just scurried out a door before it could close!
5794
Then i might have found a girl cat to sniff oh well. :3
5794
You shouldnt lose hope!
5794
I have another story that might give you hope even though it should be noted again that im only a cat.
5794
Yes one time i was with rose and i was sitting there dressed up in my suit with her as happy as can be.
5794
But then she disappeared!
5794
The whole place disappeared and i was in another place. There was no rose there was someone else.
5794
I guess i loved her too in time but never as much as rose it just wasnt the same.
5794
I kept waiting to see rose again but never did and finally i lost hope that i would and then i died.
5794
But then i became alive again and i got to see her and i was so happy! Purr purr purr purr purr.
5794
Thats my story and thats why i think theres always hope even if you die.
5794
Yes maybe. :3
5794
