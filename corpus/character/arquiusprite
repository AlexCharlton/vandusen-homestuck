7556
Holy
7556
I am so ludi%ly  STRONG
7556
Whoops, pardon my language
7556
That there was some  straight up dog   pottymouth, and I'm chagrined as   you had to hear that
7556
Dude
7556
Check out my muscles
7556
Dude, I am ripped. 100k at me fle% these naughty mother
7556
Dude
7556
E%cuse me, mister dude
7556
Check my muscles, 100k how big I can make them
7556
Bro are you getting a gander of my truly e%ceptional
7556
I am so gosh  chiseled
7556
Watch me just completely hulk out like this
7556
HRRRRRRRRRR
7556
Bro, did you see that
7556
Did you see my muscles getting all gnarly and ma%ed out
7556
What do you think
7556
Dirk
7556
E%cuse me, Dirk
7556
Tell me what you think of my glorious physique, I command you
7556
No  it's ripped
7556
My torso is the fudging ape% of manly grandeur
7556
Dude
7556
Come feel this
7556
Come feel my muscles
7556
Get over here and touch my muscles
7556
You absolutely will
7556
I'm stacked like a brick house, e%amine me with your hands at once
7556
Yes
7556
Yes
7556
Feel my muscles
7556
Do it.
7556
Observe these pectorals, they're off the silly charts
7556
My quads would be  bananas, if I had any
7556
You've got to check this out
7556
Come feel me up, bro
7556
You will
7556
Touch my muscles
7556
Yes
7556
Yes
7556
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
heck it's amazing to be alive
7557
Oh  fiddlesticks, I'm just a torrential font of absolutely e%ecrable obscenity. My bad
7557
I'm just so e%cited, feeling all these STRONG feelings and thinking all these HARD thoughts
7557
Horsefeathers, my brain is so POWERFUL, it is operating in great strides like a towering musclebeast storming into battle
7557
And these feelings. Dirk, these feelings
7557
There is a 100% probability that I love being alive
7557
And there is a 100 to the 100th POWER % certainty that I love being STRONG
7557
100k how red I am, dude
7557
I'm so red, how sick is that
7557
It's
7557
Deplorable?
7557
Ill, dog. I'm basically titillated here
7557
Are you scoping this grody  debasement
7557
That  ain't right
7557
Makes a man wanna holler improprieties, do you feel me?
7557
Let's talk about  horses
7557
Horses dude
7557
Horses
7557
Nuff said
7557
Do we have any milk?
7557
Ooh. What about a bow and arrow, are there any of those around?
7557
I'm jonesing HARD to tug at one, all like, reevaluate my proficiency at the most noble discipline
7557
What about milk, dude
7557
It seems I demand milk
7557
Oh yeah
7557
Just a lot of orange fizzy swill
7557
What was occurring in your think pan to accumulate such vile libations
7557
Just FYI, milk is the nectar of KINGS you  nincompoop
7557
Touch my muscles Dirk
7557
Yes, do it
7557
I command you
7557
What if
7557
I touched your muscles
7557
Like for comparison's sake
7557
Wait what if
7557
Good heavens
7557
A rather inappropriate thought just galloped across my matri%
7557
What if
7557
You ordered me to touch your muscles
7557
I demand that you order me to touch your muscles
7557
Do it
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Yes
7557
Maybe
7657
Mister bro, listen to my advice
7657
I think you should just go for it
7657
This is coming not only from your mystical guide, not only from an alternate version of yourself, but from a dude with a  spectacular body
7657
We both know you're never going to be happy under ordinary circumstances
7657
You just do not have the right kind of think pan to sustain that emotion
7657
100k at me. I needed to merge a sweaty guy who loves horses in order to be happy
7657
Gosh  horses Dirk
7657
I think about them all the time while I fle% and it makes me smile
7657
It seems that similarly e%treme measures will be needed for you as well
7658
You there. Small servant with the umbrella
7658
Fetch me a towel at once
7659
E%cuse me, you there
7659
Unsavory concoction of royalty and peasantry
7659
Come grope my humongous biceps
7659
Yes, do it
7659
Alright, no takers there I see. Only a pair of grotesque philistines blustering through the same coarse ignorance tunnel
7659
What about you, miss unpalatable combination of Feferi and
7659
And
7659
Oh
7659
Oh no
7659
Dirk
7659
Dirk, help, I'm having a problem
7659
A part of me is having a very STRONG emotional reaction which I don't like
7659
It's a part of myself I'm ashamed of
7659
The troll part. It did something shameful once
7659
I do not find such emotions to be an acceptable feature of my new e%istence
7659
How can I make this feeling go away
7659
Dirk, I command you to instruct me how to eliminate these emotions
7659
No. That's awful
7659
I don't know what to do
7659
With all of my astounding STRENGTH, both muscular and cerebral, how can I be stymied so?
7659
Dying was better than having to live with the shame which was ironically caused by the very death in question
7659
You, seadwelling mustard b100d
7659
Half of me commands the peasant half of you to resolve my emotional turmoil, while humbly requesting the noble half of you to do the same
7659
The other half of me doesn't give a flying hoot about your lame caste bull and is just kind of freaking out internally about this
7659
You're right, I must speak to her
7659
Nepeta, I swore that I would protect you, but I failed
7659
In a moment of weakness my reverence for a superior got the better of me, and instead of standing up for you I decided to bow before a stupid  juggalo or something? What?
7659
Wait, I actually did that? What the fresh nickering  is WRONG with me?
7659
I am not a perfect man, Nepeta. Nor am I "purrfect" as you might say. What the fudge? A cat pun? Let's pull our  together dude, this emotional state is mad abysmal
7659
But in any case, I hope you can find it within your kind olive pump biscuit to... forgive...
7659
NO!
7659
GOSH DANGIT! I don't deserve to be forgiven, what am I saying! The  I pulled on you was so bad... I just can't even...
7659
Allow me to finish, sir/peon
7659
Nepeta, you will disregard any conversation directed at Feferi and focus solely on my attempted statements of contrition
7659
Do not address Feferi while I'm talking Nepeta
7659
It's confusing to Nepeta, who is critical in absolving me of guilt, even though I probably don't deserve it?
7659
No
7659
No
7659
No
7659
Then leave us, for I and my morail have much to discuss
7659
Yes I do
7659
Yes
7659
Yes
7659
Yes
8276
Yes, mister dude?
8276
I stand so advised
8276
Or float, I should say. On my ripped as fudge little ghost tail
8276
Yo, pardon me, but did you know that when I fle% my tail, it makes this big veiny bulge kind of like a bicep?
8276
I'm doing it now, in fact
8276
Does it bother you
8276
Maybe you should order me to stop
8276
In fact, I command you to order me to stop
8276
Wow
8276
Bossy much?
8276
What can I do for you, Dirk
8277
Yes, isn't it great?
8277
I mean, aside from the fact that she is insane and evil
8277
She is one of the few organic beings who will ever realize perfe%ion
8277
Miss Crocker is now a vessel for a cunning, malicious artificial intelligence whose neural netroni% and ontology buffers and stuff like that have somehow managed to far surpass even my own
8277
Clearly she has procured ma%imum advantage from her apprenticeship under me, although I must admit not even I in all my hypercognitive percipience was quite aware that said tutelage was even taking place
8277
One must inviolably deduce via tons of math that this is because I am just that clopdarned STRONG at mentoring, even on an involuntary basis
8277
I am so proud of her
8277
The thing about Jane becoming evil is
8277
In the process of achieving perfe%ion...
8277
It seems there is a ludi%ly high probability that she has become evil
8277
Does that answer your question?
8277
Admittedly it is a blemish
8277
But only a very small one
8277
Her imperfect meatmind has been fully fiddling hijacked by a supercomputer and that is the operative transmutation here
8277
To such e%ceptional beings of class and breeding as she and I, considerations of morality and alignment are trifling details
8277
Why what
8277
Sir brah, listen
8277
Here is a comparison that your dreary, finite wad of gray matter might be able to process
8277
Like, say you've got a in' bod. You are a paragon of physical e%cellence
8277
You could then either be oiled up, or not. See what I mean, good dude?
8277
You could fle% your brawn while wearing either a sweaty pair of briefs, or a snug human banana hammock
8277
Such minutia does not change the fact that you're a tiptop beefcake ma%ed out buffways
8277
The stuff I have cited which are commonly associated with your/our Earth bodybuilders are but picayune technicalities, just as considerations of good and evil are to aristocratic se%y cybergods such as myself and our imperial heiress, of whom neither you nor I are particularly worthy
8277
Are you following any of this, Vitamin D?
8278
Oh, nothing much
8278
Just enjoying the good life
8278
One which quite lu%uriously involves both having a corporeal body, and not being dead
8278
I have been delighting myself with some truly kickbottom internal monodialogues
8278
Did you know that, even though technically I knew this already, I find myself astounded to meditate upon the fact that human beings are capable of lactation?
8278
Isn't that  incredible, Dirk?
8278
I mean, when one really thinks about it
8278
To have such convenient access to fresh milk
8278
The mare thought of it, I must say puts a little giddyup in my phantom legs
8278
And yet
8278
I must admit the notion of lactic discharge jetting from one's swollen pectoral masses...
8278
It strikes me as positively indecorous
8278
My horseguy robosweat is running cold just pondering the depravity of it
8278
Yet fascinatingly, this ability only manifests itself in human females
8278
As opposed to how one would reasonably e%pect dairy to originate, which is from the corpulent udder of a sublimely chiseled male musclebeast
8278
Or failing that, certain species found within the butler genus
8278
As a former simulation of a human who has recently been given reason to have hella opinions on milk production, I think the way females have cornered this boon is the height of biological injustice
8278
Have you ever dwelt upon this cruelty, dude esquire?
8278
Your silence speaks volumes to your interest, so I'll keep talking about this a lot
8278
I will have to confess that my Alternian half boggles at the anatomical incongruities between our races with respect to dairy secretion
8278
Really, he had no idea that's what those were for
8278
Female trolls of course have them as well, but they are certainly not meant for supplying the young with nourishment
8278
Actually, and this trivia will surely wet your whistle for additional such facts, those voluptuous anatomical features have a number of significant purposes, biologically speaking
8278
I shall now e%plicate for you these purposes in assiduous detail
8279
But why, lord bro
8279
I was just about to pony up the boob fa%
8279
There is a 100% probability that you would have been thrilled to hear my e%egesis on troll knockers
8279
Dude, that is ice cold
8279
I would be hurt, if I were not a flawless machine fused with haughty nobility
8279
If you don't wish to hear my epic monodialogue on alien bazongas
8279
I'm not sure what else I can do to entertain you
8279
You are seriously hoofcuffing my material here
8279
Pretty demanding, if you ask me
8279
But as your mystical guide, I suppose it is my duty to manufacture small talk, if that's what you really want
8279
What about fine art? We could talk about that
8279
Dirk, did you know the sweaty troll guy who I used to be, and still kind of am, used to adore fine art?
8279
He was just like you and me, in that sense
8279
It seems I have a lot in common with myself
8279
If you can ever manage to get over yourself, I would highly recommend being me
8279
Or at least something like me
8279
Maybe somewhere, there is a dead troll out there, just waiting for you to merge with him
8279
Sounds boring
8279
Are you sure you don't want to talk about paintings of big naked horse monsters and such?
8279
Pantaloons you say
8279
Sir, are you implying that you are not dressed appropriately for a discussion of high culture
8279
Because it seems to me that you could not be dressed more appropriately if you tried
8279
Where are you?
8279
How long do you suppose it will take you to get back?
8279
Never mind. I have triangulated your location and velocity using long range sensor technology, and probably also some sprite magic
8279
Hey Dirk
8279
Remember how whenever I dubiously claimed to have triangulated something, it was always this great play on words?
8279
Because I was just a pair of triangles
8279
But not anymore
8279
Because I have this rockin' new torso
8279
E%actly a little more than three hours
8279
Additional sweeps from my STRONGLASERS are telling me there are a few other people on the periphery of the session closing in at a similar rate
8279
Just some dudes
8279
What are you doing all the way out there and wearing pantaloons, by the way
8279
That was evil Jade
8279
Yes
8279
Yes
8279
Yes
8279
Yes
8279
Yes anyone here is not evil
8279
That is to say, there e%ist people here who are not evil
8279
Such as Dave
8279
Dave is not evil, to my knowledge
8280
Didn't I mention, master dogg
8280
Our mutual bro is here
8280
That is, right here
8280
With me
8280
We are kind of in the process of chilling together at the moment
8280
Yes
8280
I guess I did kind of bury the lede there
8280
Maybe I just wanted to talk
8280
We never talk, Dirk
8280
I am not sure about that
8280
Dave says he had a similarly ty guide once
8280
Do you remember our puppet, Dirk?
8280
Yes
8280
A good friend in the plush, yes, but as a sprite he was apparently insufferable
8280
See, you don't realize how lucky you are to have a guide like me
8280
Yes, for a while
8280
Then Dave went back in time and became one himself
8280
Now he is part bird
8280
Did I mention he's part bird?
8280
Of course, this means he is not the Real Dave
8280
Davesprite served as Real Dave's sprite
8280
But he is only the unreal version of Dave insofar as I am the unreal version of you
8280
By which I mean, a much improved version
8280
I must say, while the troll part of me doesn't give a silly figging shoot about any of this, the part of me that splintered from you has found the brotherly reunion to be everything which you and I dared not imagine, and more
8280
Bird Dave and I are getting along famously and STRENGTHENING our familial bonds like a sweet pair of mother
8280
I feel our kinship goes beyond geneti% though
8280
We are misfits, estranged, he from Dave's alpha timeline, I from Dirk's alpha soul
8280
A two man menagerie of sideshow frickups, together at last
8280
Fle%ing and flapping
8280
Fraternally and eternally
8280
Neigh, braj
8280
As your buff mystical guide slash personal trainer I am suggesting that if you were willing to contact me as a matter of last resnort, you might want to at least consider reaching out to him as well
8280
I didn't mean Bird Dave
8280
I meant Real Dave
8280
Not with us
8280
He is here though, somewhere
8280
You should message him
8280
It's not like you don't have a few hours to kill
8280
What else are you going to do out there
8280
Pick at your pantaloon wedgies?
8280
Yes, I canter magine it won't be
8280
At least at first
8280
I advise you to talk about your interests
8280
Like dairy
8280
Livestock
8280
Fine art
8280
And muscles
8280
Good point
8280
I advise you to talk about my interests
8502
My god...
8503
The power...
8504
It's...
8504
It's over...
8505
IT IS E%CEEDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN QUANTITY
