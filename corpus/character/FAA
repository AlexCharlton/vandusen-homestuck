this private b0ard will and has already served as a l0g 0f past events f0r future selves t0 rec0rd and a guide 0f future events f0r past selves t0 f0ll0w
i d0nt kn0w which half 0f its r0le has been 0r will be m0re imp0rtant
p0ssibly neither is critical since deviati0n fr0m the c0urse is m0stly imp0ssible and reflecti0n 0n its traversal is c0mpletely irrelevant
but im typing this anyway
because im b0red again
yes it seems that way
an err0r narr0wly av0ided then
i think we sh0uld refrain fr0m dial0gue in this mem0
with0ut res0rting t0 bannings 0r absurd exchanges 0f self repudiati0n

we will and have already amassed an army t0 c0nfr0nt the black king
an army c0nsisting 0f 0ur alternate future selves
each 0ne rer0uted fr0m a d00med 0ffsh00t 0f the alpha timeline
each given an0ther chance at a c0nstructive influence 0ver the ultimate 0utc0me
by the way if y0u didnt kn0w already
a future self returning t0 the past fr0m a d00med timeline will always be slated f0r imminent destructi0n herself
its 0ne 0f the rules
and the unf0rtunate reality is
this will and has already been a mass suicide missi0n
0r it w0uld be
and already w0uld have been
if we all werent already dead

m0bilizing 0urselves in such numbers w0uld be required t0 neutralize the kings psychic attacks
it w0uld take 0ur c0mbined c0ncentrati0n t0 dampen the abilities he inherited fr0m glbg0lyb
with0ut the cumulative eff0rt 0f 0ur d00med reserves
with0ut the heightened mental and physical endurance 0f 0ur r0b0tic vessels
with0ut the untimely demise we all shared bef0re this began
vict0ry w0uld n0t be p0ssible
he w0uld kill us all with 0ne dreadful s0und
i d0nt kn0w if it was just bad luck
0r an extensi0n 0f the curse karkat insists he br0ught 0n us
that lead t0 the incidental and unf0rtuit0us pr0t0typing 0f feferis p0werful lusus
with0ut which the battle w0uld have p0sed little challenge
i think
it was m0re likely just an0ther inevitability
a pr0duct 0f c0llusi0n between the disparate f0rces at play
a bargain struck between what skaia kn0ws already and what the g0ds demand up fr0nt
t0gether they 0rchestrate trials sufficient t0 ensure
that in 0verc0ming them we w0uld be pr0ven w0rthy
0f inheriting 
ribbit
wh00ps
and s0 it w0uld be and has been already
that while distracted by the c0mbined eff0rts 0f 0ur d00med legi0n
the king w0uld be aggressed by the 0thers
and even th0ugh each w0uld be well prepared
perched 0n the highest rungs 0f their echeladders
equipped with the best weap0nry grist c0uld build
versed in the deadliest fraym0tifs b00nd0llars c0uld buy
even th0ugh the mete0rs fr0m the kings 0wn reck0ning w0uld be turned against him
and even with 0ne imp0ssibly lucky r0ll 0f the dice at the final m0ment
we w0uld 0nly narr0wly succeed
but ultimately
we w0uld pr0ve 0ur w0rth
and the reward w0uld be within 0ur reach
but 0nly m0mentarily
bef0re we w0uld be able t0 claim it
we w0uld be interrupted
by s0mething
which w0uld be ushered int0 0ur sessi0n by a rift in parad0x space
a rift which we w0uld determine
will be 0pened by f0ur members 0f a fledgling species
wh0 will be playing in an0ther sessi0n 0f the same game that we will and have already played
their rift will lead t0 the great und0ing
with0ut necessarily causing it
n0t directly
such rifts are themselves supp0sedly benign
useful even
they are catal0gued phen0mena within the game itself
with a pr0vided means 0f creating them
and a wide range 0f scenari0s f0r which it might be prudent t0 d0 s0
the incipisphere l0cals have a m0re f0rmal term f0r them
they typically refer t0 such a rift as
a scratch
