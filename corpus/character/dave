1926
hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today
1926
oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here
1926
but
1926
the seal on the bottle is unbroken
1926
are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory
1926
why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like
1926
i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous
1926
ok i can accept that
1926
monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters
1926
also fred savage has a really punchable face
1926
but who cares about this lets stop talking about it
1926
did you get the beta yet
1926
man i got two copies already
1926
but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring
1926
did you see how it got slammed in game bro????
1926
yeah
1926
why dont you go check your mail maybe its there now
1935
is it there
1935
plz say yes
1935
maybe you can play with TT shes been pestering me all day about it
1935
shes mackin on me so hard all the time i start to feel embarrassed for her
1935
i mean not that i can blame her or anything
1935
thank you
1935
whats your modus
1935
how do you retrieve artifacts from it
1935
stack?? hahahahahaha
1935
hash map
1935
my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome
1935
you should probably brush up on your data structures
1935
did you at least allocate your strife specibus
1935
it could free up a card for you
1935
plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
1935
which is never
1935
what have you got
1935
wow you really suck at this dont you
1935
just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus
1935
i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works
1939
hammerkind?
1939
ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus
1939
i guess i should have mentioned that
1939
hope you like hammers dude!
2010
hey GG is looking for you why are you even so popular all of a sudden
2010
is today some sort of special occasion or something
2010
did you do something to curry favor with ladies
2010
did you break your leg on a puppy or some shit
2010
dude what are you doing
2010
no stop
2010
just no
2010
dont talk about your awful stupid movies or make references to them
2010
your gross man-bro crush on matt macconahay is an unsavory thing to behold
2010
sounds like a noise a horse would make
2010
ie dumb
2010
equally dumb are all those pictures of that clown youve got hanging up
2010
i was talking about nick cage
2010
ha ha so lame
2010
you dont even like him ironically or anything this is like for real isnt it
2010
hahaha
2010
no those are awesome
2010
im wearing them ironically
2010
because theyre awesome
2010
the fact that theyre ironic makes them awesome
2010
and vice versa
2010
are you taking notes on how to be cool?? jesus get a fucking pen
2010
ew yeah
2010
oh well
2010
anyway speaking of which
2010

2010
oh man the beta came
2010
haha no way
2010
it sounds so HELLS of boring just get TT to play it she is all about that
2010
her internet is blinking in and out i guess
2010

2010
oh and christ in a sidecar are you still using the stack modus???
2010

2010

2104
i heard you got the box
2104
i hope you appreciate my heroic fatherly perseverance in getting it to you
2104
in my rough and tumble dirty wifebeaterly sort of way
2104
also i hope you appreciate how many no-talent douches had their mitts on that bunny before you
2104
its like a grubby baton in some huge douchebag marathon
2104
hey where are you
2104
dude i told you to steer clear of that game
2104
and for that matter you should probably wash your hands of flighty broads and their snarky horseshit altogether
2104
oh man
2104
how big is it
2104
like the size of texas
2104
or just rhode island
2104
theyre always throwing around these geographical comparisons to give us a sense of scale like it really means anything to us
2104
but its like it doesnt matter its always just like: WOW THATS PRETTY FUCKING BIG
2104
like mr president theres a meteor coming sir. oh yeah, how big is it? its the size of texas sir
2104

2187

morgan freeman or something
2187

2187
"obama made it so that no one gives a shit about black presidents in movies anymore"

2194
cant explain to me why this aint condescension to think ill shit a brick
2194
not even he can convey the intention with his quickspun wit

2999

2999
when the stars come into alignment and your flux capacitor lets you finally sate your meteoric greed for crotch-dachshund
2999
i wouldnt want to miss it and cause a paradox or something
2999

TRANSPIRE
3293
hey

will you open your laptop already
3293
see
3293
this is why you need a phone or something
3293
that alerts you to important messages
3293
instead of leaving them trapped
3293
under three inches of fucking yarn
3293
laptops dont need cozies
3293
nothing needs cozies
3293
cozy is a goddamn adjective
3293

3293
i can see your whole damn house here if you want to get filled in or something im sort of the guy with the big picture here
3293

3293
ill do it
3293
ok no i wont
3293
yet
3293
i guess ill bone up on the faq for a while
3293
so i dont do anything stupid and deploy like 10 crux flangers and fuck up the whole game
3293
oh my god
3293
so many words
3293
do you think like the pulitzer committee is secretly scouring the dregs of the gamefaq archives or something
3293
damn
3293
i cant read this shit im sorry
3293
whoa ok hey
3293
yeah
3293
but she wont answer me
3293
pretty much you have no idea how much i fuckin own at this game
3293
i bested no less than three flaming tornados and broke a huge wizard
3293
it feels like
3293
i am in sports
3293
all alone
3293
and i am the star
3293
its me
3293
and then the big man comes

3293
i mean i own at the game and all but cant i just relax for half a second
3293
what
3293
look i was getting my ass handed to me by my bro on the roof for like an hour and a half
3293
i got served like a dude on butler island
3293
wait does this mean theres a big meteor coming soon
3293
when you activate the thing will it start the countdown and summon the meteor
3293
are you totally sure about all this
3293
ok yes that image is definitely conclusive proof of something and is 100% understandable by anyone who looks at it
3293
how big is this thing
3293
like the size of rhode island or texas or what
3293
i need some context to know how much crap i should be shitting into my pants
3293
well as if like one the size of a bus wouldnt kill me anyway
3293
wait hold on rose is finally opening her stupid laptop
3293
so do your thing i guess
3293
have fun
3299
do you think like the pulitzer committee is secretly scouring the dregs of the gamefaq archives or something
3299
damn
3299
i cant read this shit im sorry
3299
hold what
3299
i see you at your computer typing
3299
what are you doing
3299

3299
brb gotta make sure she doesnt break all my shit
3300
hey wait
3300
i always keep birds in here its sort of my thing
3300
no no thats irony this is like
3300
sincere honest to god psychosis
3300
im training to be a lame gothy supervillain
3300
ok
3300
well maybe you should take the opportunity to put it somewhere that isnt stone cold retarded
3300
no its not
3301
i dont know how does she do any of the loopy batshit nonsense she does
3301
maybe she pulled them out of the volcano over there on bloodmonkey mountain
3301
we went over this
3301
i was a little bogged down
3301
in the epic swaddle of legendary puppet taint
3301
whoa wait
3301
what the hell is she doing
3301
shes taking my bed what the hell
3302
so seriously what were you doing just now
3302
who
3302
yeah
3302
oh i see you opted to chat up one of those dbags instead of talk to the guy who saved you from a swirling shitstorm of angry flaming wizards
3302
i was worried your priorities might have been out of whack but no i was dead wrong
3302
how is he
3302
i should probably text him soon
3302
see whats up
3302
because
3302
i love him
3302
so this place youre at now
3302
its the same place hes at right
3338
this is the worst shitting thing ive ever seen
3338
the thing that just happened
3338
jesus
3338
and the worst thing is
3338
all that juice i drank
3338
i mean
3338
you just HAD TO FIGURE all that juice was going to come back to haunt me
3338
like frankensteins incontinent fucking ghost
3338
it was like
3338
chekhovs juice
3338
let me be perfectly clear
3338
what i am trying to say is
3338
its like fucking christmas up in my bladder here
3338
and where do i find my toilet
3338
oh look here it is
3338
amputated in my room
3338
gagged with a towel like a fucking prison hostage
3338
and now the cruxploder is counting down
3338
4 hours oh i guess thats not that bad
3338
what
3338
oh god
3338
are you asleep
3339
ok
3339
ok lets just
3339
not panic here
3339
lets try to play it cool
3339
and not break all my shit
3339
also dont put anything weird in the seizure kernel
3339
im going to go find somewhere to pee
3339
dont watch me ok
3339
like i know you dream about me enough already
3339
lets keep some shit left to the imagination ok
3339
the last thing i need is for your weird brain webcam to be snapping shots of my dong
3339
your grandpa was a sick fuck why would he build a voyeurbot for a little girl
3339
fuck
3344
what
3344
what is it
3344
what bird
3344
i wouldnt know anything about that
3344
that could be anyones sword
3344
what does it look like
3344
is it a cheap piece of shit
3344
cause i only bother with high quality blades
3344
forged by stoic asian masters
3344
hells of rude kinds of expensive
3344
wait
3344
what do you mean
3344
dammit hold on a minute
3347
wow awesome
3347
so now i guess instead having of a wise or helpful spirit guide sprite thing
3347
im stuck with this brainless feathery asshole
3347
we need to wake you up
3347
youre not very logical like this
3347
kind of dumb really
3347
yeah but come on you sleep like 20 hours a day
3348
where are you sitting
3348
are you on your bed
3348
what side
3348
ok heres what i want you to do
3348
just humor me
3348
raise your left hand
3348
now
3348
just kind of swat the air to your left
3405
oh man
3405
awesome
3405
its awesome where you put that
3405
i was worried we were on the verge of getting some shit done
3405
well where are they
3405
you say there will be stairs
3405
and yet
3405
i see no stairs
3405
sorry
3405
am i supposed to break that thing
3405
or hatch it
3405
or what
3405
also what happened to all my shit
3405
the stuff scattered all over the roof
3405
did you put it somewhere
3405
i mean not that i care
3405
it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
3405
i was going to use it to fight my bro with
3405
but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
3405
also he was too fast
3407
ok so
3407
the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
3407
please advise
3407
do you think thatll take more than four hours
3407
its hot as the sizzle side of the steak
3407
maybe i should try to get it back
3407
and put it in the microwave
3410
you mean the jumper block thing
3410
wait what
3410
the thing costs 1000 for me
3410
what
3410
man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
3410
what the hell
3410
hang on ill ask
3410
she says 20
3410
yeah
3410
so i guess you can buy everything now
3410
ok now i know youre making this shit up
3410
well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
3410
and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
3410
oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
3410
so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
3410
hey look we're learning stuff
3411
what should i do with these beta copies
3411
i dont really need them anymore
3411
wow that was a weird answer
3411
but ok
3463
ok
3464
so i guess this is just a built in designix
3464
which is sort of cool i guess
3464
since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
3464
because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
3464
but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
3464
so really who cares
3488
im building up your house
3488
by the way why do you live in this weird compound
3488
do you host east european industrial raves
3488
nevermind the point is
3488
im out of grist
3488
so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
3488
maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
3488
i dont know beach the thing first i guess
3488
unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
3488
what do you mean
3488
you kill it
3488
release a shitload of grist
3488
maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
3488
does it even have a skull
3488
or a brain stem
3488
can you find out
3488
what
3488
but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
3488
this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
3488
wow fuck ok
3488
you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
3488
but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
3488
no but hes still got a ton so screw him
3488
yeah me too
3489
who
3489
oh yeah sure
3489
i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
3489
wrong what do you want
3489
what the hell
3489
you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
3489
like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
3489
and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
3489
so you just watch it like crack and turn black
3489
man wait
3489
whats this about
3489
you have a thing for her dont you
3489
dont deny it bro its obvious
3489
hahahaha so terrible
3489
what a transparent dodge
3489
all hiding behind your alien shit
3489
just admit it
3489
you want me to help you win her over
3489
ok well its easy
3489
for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
3489
see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
3489
oh my flipping christ
3489
ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
3489
oh ok
3489
that was pretty good
3489
maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
3489
hahaha yes youre on a roll
3489
oh
3489
alright look
3489
if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
3489
reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
3489
i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
3489
thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
3489
be like
3489
an antagonism ninja
3489
like her
3489
i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
3489
it could be a horrible thing though
3489
yeah i guess i am
3489
i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
3489
good luck bro
3495
dont care
3537
ok im in
3537
the medium
3537
what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
3537
i dont want to talk about it
3537
imagine the worst day of my life
3537
just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
3537
then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
3537
yeah
3537
stfu
3537
what are you doing
3537
ok
3537
i need some advice
3537
my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
3537
turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
3537
with a sword in it
3537
it seems to want me to prototype it again
3537
not sure what to do
3537
shes asleep for some reason
3537
yeah i saw her there
3537
all tuckered out
3537
like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
3537
cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
3537
like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
3537
anyway what do you think
3537
ok fine but
3537
it seems to be suggesting something here
3537
and
3537
i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
3537
ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
3537
but alright later
3542
shut up
3542
no
3542
just
3542
god damn it
3542
please
3542
just once
3542
shut the hell up
3542
shut up
3542
shut
3542
the
3542
fuck
3542
up
3543
thats it i cant take it anymore
3543
it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass
3543
im going back
3543
what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months
3543
or something
3543
i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping
3543
what else is there to know
3543
we lost
3543
cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch
3543
yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again
3543
or the trolls for that matter
3543
after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen
3543
i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us
3543
and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective
3543
only thing left to do is change all that
3543
theres not much to remember
3543
i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge
3543
i dont know what he was thinking
3543
even we couldnt kill one of those things yet
3543
with our higher levels and all our sick gear
3543
nah itll be fine dont worry
3543
i dont know
3543
i mean your whole timeline will
3543
maybe
3543
the thing with time travel is
3543
you cant overthink it
3543
just roll with it and see what happens
3543
and above all try not to do anything retarded
3543
try going to sleep
3543
our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think
3543
so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen
3543
and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through
3543
the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem
3543
anything else is gravy
3543
yeah thatd be cool i guess
3543
im gonna go now
3546
ok im in
3546
the medium
3546
what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
3546
i dont want to talk about it
3546
imagine the worst day of my life
3546
just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
3546
then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
3546
yeah
3546
stfu
3546
what are you doing
3546
ok
3546
i need some advice
3546
my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
3546
turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
3546

3549

im coming down to the computer
3593
ok i dont know what youre doing here
3593
but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
3593
dude no come on
3593
shes out like a light anyway
3593
it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
3593
yeah
3593
shit doesnt get more clear than that
3593
fine dont
3593
but here just do this one thing
3593
see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
3593
you dont have to read them im not telling you to
3593
what kind of prying tool do you take me for
3593
just pick them up
3593
you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now
3594
now i need you to do something else
3594
this is important
3594
like for important game reasons and stuff
3594
take the card the books are on
3594
flip it over
3594
so you can see the code
3594
dude you dont have to tell me the code
3594
just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
3594
alright cool
3594
you can ditch the books now if you want
3594
maybe put them back on the floor
3594
so rose doesnt think you were snooping
3594
seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
3594
what is even with you
3594
isnt that your birthday package there
3594
maybe you should look at it
3594
i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
3757
whoa why are you burning your wizard fanfiction
3757
oh ok
3757
then why are you burning that
3757
is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
3757
or something to do with tentacle monsters
3757
i cant keep track of what you like anymore
3757
john told me
3757
he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
3757
so not cool
3757
then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
3757
and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
3757
do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
3757
i thought you hated wizards
3757
whats the deal with that
3757
oh man thats so messed up
3757
that you think that
3757
she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
3757
you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
3757
youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
3757
oh yeah
3757
i thought that was a joke
3757
when did they say that
3757
you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
3757
ive never seen or heard these things in my dreams
3757
uh yeah
3757
no what a ridiculous question
3757
....
3757
........
3757
..........................
3757
dunno
3757
anyway yeah i guess ill do that
3757
get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
3758
are you talking to future me
3758
ok im out of the loop again
3758
between you taking orders from dream beasts and bird wing me with like
3758
future secrets
3758
im doing some sort of spectacular fucking jackknife off the loop and getting a wink and a nod from barack obana
3758
im coming upstairs
3761
so it was pretty funny how i made a copy of roses evil book right before she burned it and now she doesnt know about it
3761
the best thing about how i did that is how it in no way will ever come back to bite us in the ass ever
3761
so safe
3761
safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle
3761
keep twisting junior all you get is clicks
3761
yeah
3761
anyway guess ill go back down and burn that book
3835
what
3835
fuck off
3835
youre the annoying blind one arent you
3835
dave told me about you
3835
man im telling you burns like that are unreal
3835
where do you even get a burn thats that sick
3835
no you messed that up
3835
uh
3835
did you try to draw shades on his face and miss
3835
whats even the point hes already wearing shades
3835
this is moronic
3835
i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
3835
but i sure as hell know what it looks like
3835
like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
3835
shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
3835
every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
3835
just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
3835
this miraculous gift of vision
3835
i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
3835
i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
3835
my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
3835
and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
3835
cause we can both see
3835
just him and me
3835
havin a see party
3835
like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours
3835
i guess but youll have to be careful not to stumble around bumping into all the gorgeous masterpieces hanging around everywhere
3835
god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight
3835
yeah thats fine
3839
oh hell
3839
that
3839
ok thats pretty amazing
3839
hey speaking of which
3839
where is my bro anyway
3839
havent seen him at all since i got here
3839
davesprite doesnt know
3839
you can see everything that goes on right
3839
or like smell it or whatever
3839
how does that even work
3839
how do you use a computer and know whats going on it doesnt make sense
3839
my face doesnt make sense
3839
hahaha
3839
ew
3839
oh ok
3839
so the dumbest and most far fetched explanation imaginable ok got it
3839
man dont remind me about that
3839
so embarrassing
3839
ok cool
3839
whos upset
3839
bout time the dude gave me a little space
3839
i guess
3839
alright so whats next
3839
why would i be scared
3839
we have cotton candy dumpass
4637
hey
4637
has it
4637
man who cares
4637
i mean thats great and all
4637
but i talked to you plenty more times since that from where im standing
4637
ive got to make this quick
4637
fuck no fuck that trollian horseshit
4637
its just regular old time travel
4637
im from the future
4637
no
4637
just regular ordinary dave from the fucking future nothing special dude come on
4637
yeah ok it is awesome but im in a hurry
4637
i need to borrow some boondollars off you
4637
no they do do something
4637
what do you think they buy shit its fucking money
4637
i cant answer all these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money
4637
you you might as well give it to me
4637
all of it
4637
man you just said you thought it was useless why do you care
4637
ill pay you back
4637
in the future
4637
if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future
4637
yeah we do
4637
but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that
4637
no shit your deal is wind not time
4637
youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind
4637
like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
4637
its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
4637
leave it to the pros ok
4637
yeah it can work that way
4637
or not
4637
ive been very careful
4637
this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
4637
no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
4637
yeah
4637
there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
4637
but they are all me
4637
i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
4637
thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
4637
ive got some help though
4637
yeah
4637
man dont even get me started with that
4637
the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
4637
i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
4637
i dont know man they seem to flock to me
4637
ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
4637
its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
4637
oh you know
4637
noirs outta control
4637
rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
4637
well youre you
4637
and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
4637
but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
4637
and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
4637
so im staying on track here
4637
speaking of which
4637
give me your money
4637
oh christ
4637
only one
4637
well fuck nevermind then
4637

4637
i mean
4637
ill take it anyway but damn
4637
im working the system here
4637
using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector
4637
making a goddamn killing in the lohacse
4637
lohac stock exchange
4637
my planet

4672
thats a retarded thing to say even by the standard of your own bullshit made up vernacular
4672
whos he really
4672
your boyfriend or something
4672
ok asking for an explanation on that is pretty much the exact opposite of what im doing
4672
and interesteds the opposite of what im being
4672
ok that remark was almost as boring as it was weird
4672
haha
4672
i dont cry

the only thing im getting
4674
is out of this goddamn idiot cauldron here

truth be told everyone will be tripping when im done
4680
once i upset this biznasty with my swift cuts
4680
dudes will phalanx themselves agape like theyre offerin to store my shit in their mouths for the night
4680
rows of glasseyed human fly catchers beholding categorical fucking domination of the dance floor
4680
but they wont catch none cause the flys all mine
4680
theres not any i dont have
4680
im crafting a new dance move
4680
to shock the shit out of asses in pants
4680
fred astaires ghost will weep in the arms of his own nimble rotting corpse
4680
its called
4680
the smug cracker parlor wiggle
4680
of course
4680
and just when the scene thought it was startin to recover from its ridiculous erection over that
4680
thats when i bust out another fierce move
4680
i call it rageclock me in the douche smirk plz
4680
cut out to the rude jam "askin 4 it!"
4680

4680
i dont know about that
4680
i dont know if you can keep up with me kid

but what else is new just another lady from outer space mackin on me whatever chance she gets
4690
pretty sure she is
4690
or he thinks she is or something
4690
made it pretty obvious when he started ranting at me months ago
4690
back when i suspected these trolls were full of shit
4690
but now look how far weve come
4690
theres not any doubt left about that at all
4690
right
4690
sounds like its time to get a clue she is over you dude
4690
john god dammit stop embarrassing us
4690
first of all weve got to be on record here as not giving a shit about that
4690
second obviously theres gonna be 4 quadrants come on
4690
k then bye
4690
sounds like a loudmouth inferiority thing going on here to me
4690
like you dont want to acknowledge that your troll ladies find a couple of human dudes irresistible
4690
smooth
4690
i dunno
4690
do you like her
4690
yeah ok
4690
but i mean
4690
anything more than that
4690
like
4690
if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits
4690
and she was on earth visiting your town or something
4690
would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies
4690
like the new maconnohey jam where he smirks and like all but deliberately draws the audiences ire like a goddamn magnetron
4690
doesnt concern you dude
4690
i dunno man doesnt sound like you really got our interests in mind here
4690
you just sound kinda bitter
4690
did one of the human ladies reject you
4690
how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square
4690
holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro
4690
is that how it went down
4690
or maybe it was a guy who rejected you
4690
haha wow bingo
4690
see how i look right now thats a poker face might want to take some notes
4690
oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time
4690
ok youre clearly gay and youve probably got some issues about it dude
4690
john just a heads up in the future i think youre gonna spurn one of his awkward advances
4690
what
4690
the fuck
4690
are you talking about
4690
thats obviously not gonna happen
4690
dude
4690
no
4690
just
4690
stop
4690
oh my fucking god
4690
please let this conversation not be taking place
4690
ok youre by far the worst artist out of any of us
4690
and thats saying something
4690
thx for the shipping grid bro imma drop everything and go have a baby with jade right now
4690
no peeking k
4690
you should go back to sleep
4690
it was so much cooler when you were asleep and i basically never had to listen to you ever
4718
what
4718
oh god thats right
4718
you were the best troll
4718
i remember now
4718
yeah
4718
i mean
4718
in the most ironic and hilarious ways possible
4718
but that really shouldnt even need to be said
4718
it was months ago for me
4718
you did your bizarrely oblivious juggalo thing
4718
then bitched and moaned at me for ruining your religion or some horseshit
4718
like i guess a weird crisis in faith i dunno
4718
and then
4718
you kinda got over that i guess
4718
and we both proceeded to have one of the best rap-offs in the history of paradox space
4718
remember
4718
could be time shit
4718
you might not have had the conversation yet
4718
do you remember if you watched any videos
4718
from earth
4718
that i might have sent
4718
dude i was telling you
4718
youve got to check this out
4718
trust me itll lift your spirits shit will all make sense to you finally
4718
youll finally figure out who you are and why you worship all this ridiculous clown bullshit
4718
and also why your planet has faygo for some baffling reason
4718
actually no nevermind it doesnt explain that
4718
that still makes no damn sense
4718
but like
4718
the thing youre looking for
4718
your dark clownish salvation or whatever the fuck
4718

our religion man
4725

4725
i still believe though
4725
in my heart so long as it keeps thumping the righteous beat
4725
subwoofing out devotion every which way
4725
that he will come

oh god
4726
ok stop
4726
hahaha
4726

4726
nevermind
4726
god dammit
4726
fuckin piece of shit sword
4726
wont goddamn budge probably useless anyway
4726
its a legendary piece of shit
4727
ok im kinda starting to wonder why youre bugging me now
4727
youre a fuckin creepy dude
4727
what
4727
you mean the guy who spent years beating my ass down with a puppet
4727
yeah i remember
4727
man
4727
im not that strong ok
4727
just cause i broke a cheap ass sword doesnt make me the fucking hulk
4727
what did you go around breaking a bunch of swords too
4727
how the fuck do you even wield a broken bow
4727
did you go around clubbing shit with the two halves
4728
whats it look like
4728
so am i
4728
bow down before your new king bitch
4733
please dont say this party started please dont say this party started
4733
god everything is about parties with you
4733
ok
4733
lets see some fine art then
4733
ok that
4733
is every bit as shitty as all your other drawings
4733
i like it though you dont gotta improve
4733
art skills are overrated
4733
its kind of weird though what the hell is actually going on here
4733
does this mean something
4733
yeah
4733
but
4733
why
4733
alright but
4733
i mean even if that made sense which it kind of doesnt
4733
karkat was saying how it was all a game and youre just flirtin and stuff
4733
and that we should quit it because he doesnt want you in my grill or me in yours or whatever
4733
well yeah thats what i thought too
4733
and really if we got no other reason keep rolling with it at least theres that one
4733
to piss him off
4733
im not saying i know for sure but it seems to me like
4733
my grill is your goddamn prison
4733
you are practically incarcerated in that fucker
4733
doing hard time on a bed of charcoal and lighterfluid
4733
privy to what i flame broil from below
4733
what im sayin is you got a front row seat to the brown side of my burger
4733
hows it smell btw
4733
yeah i thought so
4733
so is that whats going on
4733
is this some weird game involving flirtation and assassinations or whatever
4733
thats pretty much the most insulting thing possible to say im anything like that raving gulf of shit
4733
issues
4733
what are you talking about
4733
wow ok what does that have to do with me
4733
i dunno i guess maybe when i become future me
4733
fuck who cares
4733
like i even give a shit about being a hero whatever that even means
4733
im not seeing the problem here future me is awesome he can bail me out if he wants
4733
not gonna happen
4733
hey look at this change of subject going down
4733
about this comic
4733
are you saying im about to fall asleep
4734
why
4734
i dont feel tired
4734
could be rose waking me up again
4734
bonkin me with yarn or some shit
4734
can you see in my dreams
4734
too bad
4734
last time i promised rose id take off my shades and look in the sky for some reason
4734
youre gonna miss a hell of a show
4734
so i guess i have to summon davesprite too
4734
whys that
4734
huh
4734
ok
4734
yeah kinda
4734
didnt think this useless horseshit was boss grade loot to be honest
4734
ok see ya
4735
sup
4736
is that how you pronounce that
4736
what are welsh things doing in this game
4736
fuck yeah it is
4736
is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something
4736
yeah thats what i figured
4736
fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....
4736
yeah
4736
goddamn jpeg hero
4736
right here
4736
dude its long gone
4736
up in skaia now or something
4736
thrashing ill grinds on clouds
4736
yeah you got it
4736
so why wasnt this legendary pos in the sylladex you gave me
4736
did you chuck it after you alchemized it
4736
should i just chuck it too
4736
hes the denizen right
4736
isnt that like a greek god
4736
or roman or whatever
4736
what is greco roman shit doing in here you know what never mind
4736
whats the forge
4736
huh
4736
you mean jades volcano
4736
so do you know this stuff cause youre from the future or cause youre a sprite
4736
so now youre like
4736
a wise feathery asshole
4736
yeah i guess
4736
really
4736
there was no other way to get it out
4736
thats kind of retarded
4736
ok
4736
yeah
4736
that sounds about like something id do if i were you
4736
which i am
4736
so hey
4736
apparently im about to fall asleep
4737
yeah probably
4737
anyway monsters will show up soon and try to eat my sleeping corpse
4737

4737
so thats where you come in
4737

4737
guess ill make myself comfortable here
4737
what do you mean
4737
where will you go
4737
oh yeah
4737

naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
4924
hey
4924
welcome to the medium finally i guess
4924
ok i dont know what youre talking about it was probably just some horrorterror chirping at you during one of your nap bubble mindfucks
4924
its not the point i just wanted to say
4924
i just saw you
4924
yeah
4924
you appeared for a second
4924
shooting at an imp
4924
then you disappeared
4924
no you can kill them
4924
youll get better dont worry
4924
three places
4924
i remember seeing you twice before in different locations
4924
but at the moment im standing in the middle of this snowy goddamn field freezing my shit off
4924
just wanted to see if you were cool
4924
no i was
4924
this is future me
4924
one of the future mes that is
4924
yeah jade thats what future me means
4924
yeah
4924
its ok
4924
hey its pretty fucking cold
4924
so im gonna go some place warm be back in a while later
4924
ok im back
4924
an hour later
4924
an hour for me
4924
a second for you
4924
i ran around for an hour got my ass some place warm
4924
went back in time
4924
picked up where we left off
4924
yeah
4924
i guess im sorta used to it by now i dont think of hours going by the same way anymore
4924
i mean
4924
they are my hours but not everyone elses theyre kind of like private hours all to myself
4924
while everyone else is sort of in slow motion stuck in the thick of the alpha
4924
well yeah
4924
my thing is time yours is space
4924
pretty different things
4924
you GET things about space i dont
4924
or you will
4924
yup
4924
pretty believable since you lived on guam or wherever the fuck
4924
and also inside an active volcano
4924
well ive never seen it either now that i think about it
4924
no
4924
nah
4924
lavas better
4924
yeah it is lava and skeletal skyscrapers all melting and shit how is that not way cooler than
4924
snow and
4924
like
4924
more snow
4924
snows a big chilly carpet of nobody gives a shit
4924
like old man winter spread around his nasty mayonnaise and turned the landscape into his personal asshole sandwich
4924
when i look around all i see is the miles of unharnessed snowmen im just too damn cool to build
4924
whoa jade with the fucking haymaker
4924
i need to go look for my teeth on the canvas as soon as shit stops spinning and there stops being like ten of you
4924
time
4924
time
4924
time then shades
4924
time
4924
time/shades lets go
4924
oh my fucking god
4924
im not gonna play in the snow
4924
maybe you missed those credentials i flashed which clearly stated me being too cool for that
4924
like federally too cool
4924
my coolness is named after a dead president plus his middle initial to make it sound extra legit
4924
ok
4924
i thought you were going inside
4924
well at least make some damn clothes
4924
something warmer why dont you alchemize some shit
4924
blew up
4924
i completely understand everything about that practically entirely
4924
no dont bother john
4925
hes on like his fuckin
4925
wind mission or whatever
4925
getting all his ridiculous magic cyclone powers on and realizing his huge blowy destiny
4925
as the chump of shoosh
4925
almost
4925
we all start out somewhere
4925
remember how i was scrambling up that tower to get that egg like an idiot
4925
what the hell was i doing
4925
i was like goddamn pooh bear in a tree reaching up his fat fuckin pooh paw for some mother fuckin honey
4925
so even though im awesome now at one point i was plausibly likened to an autistic stuffed animal
4925
and you even knew what to do
4925
you told me how it worked all christopher robinning my ignorant ass about that egg
4925
but i was all like IM A LITTLE BLACK RAIN CLOUD BITCH WATCH ME CLIMB
4925
so maybe youre startin out with more sense than me
4925
in any case egbert lost his computer and game disc
4925
so he cant do anything for you anyways
4925
probably some shit like thats what happened
4925
but youre not completely screwed
4925
we just have to think outside the box here
4925
yeah honestly i figured wed have to do something like this
4925
so i guess here we are doing it
4925
well youre my server player remember
4925
i need you to deploy something first
4925
in my apartment
4925
in a few hours ill go back there and we can continue this
4925
yeah
4925
as in a few seconds
4925
im back at my place now
4925
yeah
4925
now
4925
deploy the intellibeam laserstation
4925
no it costs practically nothing
4925
check out how much ive got
4926
its mostly pretty stupid and useless
4926
but itll come in handy here
4926
it reads captcha codes
4926
yeah
4926
some are too garbled and complicated
4926
the human eye cant decipher them
4926
needs sophisticated scanning technology
4926
and artificial intelligence to figure it out
4926
yeah well
4926
thats why this is so dumb
4927
i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
4927
like an anti piracy measure
4927
so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
4927
well yeah thats what captchas are for
4927
and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
4927
cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
4927
a potted plant
4927
that would be fucking mayhem
4927
but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
4927
and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
4927
now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
4927
basically robots are in control now
4927
which is good news and bad news
4927
the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
4927
thats also the good news
4927
whats it look like
4927
im duplicating my server disc
4928
nah i told you were not bothering john
4928
hes got shit to do
4928
ill just install it
4928
dont see why not
4928
we have to get creative here
4928
this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
4928
well he was
4928
he got you in didnt he
4928
but now hes not
4928
been a change of plans
4928
time to roll with it
4929
yeah more or less
4929
i never really studied how it went down all that closely
4929
i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
4929
like it is now
4929
managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
4929
and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
4929
by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
4929
yeah i know
4930
thisll be the disc i use for your connection
4930
while the original will stay bound to roses connection
4930
well technically
4930
i will be your server
4930
and past me will stay as roses server
4930
which is to say present me will
4930
the one in the black suit
4930
he can keep managing her for a while
4930
until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
4930
then he can start hopping around time like i did
4930
make a ton of money and stuff
4930
eventually become me
4930
and become your server player
4930
yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
4930
in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
4930
dont worry about it just some more future stuff
4930
now i need you to go downstairs
4931
im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
4931
ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
4931
which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
4931
which seems like a hella long time ago
4931
yeah but it kind of literally is for me
4931
few days i guess
4931
whatever
4936
nak nak nak
4936
THE GLASSES ARE TALKING AGAIN
4936
naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
4936
:V
4936
:(
4936
hey
4936
what just happened
4937
oh yeah
4937
so shes here then
4937
is she ok what was going on there
4937
i guess i should catch up with her
4937
i am
4937
oh ok time travels involved
4937
thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
4937
weird
4937
and kind of boring
4937
i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
4937
being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
4937
whats with your book collection
4937
or
4937
dream book collection
4937
all your books are bizarre and terrible
4937
nah
4937
but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
4937
oh
4937
yeah
4937
i did
4937
horrible things
4937
yeah
4937
it was like
4937
peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
4937
and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
4937
and
4937
when i saw them
4937
their voices became clearer
4937
i couldnt really focus on anything specific
4937
but
4937
in totality
4937
im pretty sure it was
4937
like
4937
a plea for help
4939
no it was disturbing
4939
so i slapped my shades back on
4939
went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
4939
oh god why would i want that
4939
im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
4939
use your powers and like
4939
stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
4939
tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
4939
whats that mean
4939
who cares if theyre getting killed
4939
theyre hideous and obnoxious
4939
oh ok cool
4940
oh shit youre kidding
4940
no really are you serious i didnt even notice
4940
fuck mind = blown
4940
ok
4940
what am i supposed to do
4940
like
4940
a treasure map
4940
why
4940
plot a course to what
4941
oh right the green sun ok
4941
wait sorry
4941
i mean the  my bad
4941
whats the deal with this thing
4941
i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
4941
and by extension i guess jack
4941
yeah
4941
how big
4941
i need a sense of scale here
4941
is it like the size of our sun
4941
or bigger
4941
or is it only as big as like
4941
planet fucking jupiter
4941
ok thats pretty fucking big
4941
see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
4941
i mean hopy shit thats huge
4941
so ok i make a map to this thing
4941
with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
4941
and then i guess we go there for some reason
4941
why do we need a map
4941
cant they just
4941
tell us what direction its in
4941
point a spaceship that way
4941
blast off to adventure
4941
i can kind of get that time is messed up there
4941
with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
4941
being the knight of time here
4941
not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
4941
space isnt my thing remember
4941
what is it like
4941
full of wormholes or something
4941
i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
4941
seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
4941
fair enough
4941
so i take my map and fly to this thing
4941
ok you fly to it
4941
then what
4942
you mean with the quest youre sending him on
4942
is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
4942
so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
4942
yeah
4942
so whats The Tumor do
4942
i mean the tumor
4942
jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
4942
well ok you can keep doing it then
4942
ok cool what is it
4942
ok i wont say anything
4942
just tell me
4943
what the hell is a bomb doing in there
4943
first time for everything i guess
4943
seriously whered you get all this info
4943
did you get it all from the gods
4943
are these just a bunch of orders youre following
4943
what
4943
what you mean a troll
4943
sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
4943
oh so he knows everything
4943
even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
4943
whys he want to die
4943
wait
4943
what
4943
ok i get it now
4944
whoa fuck
4944
a suicide mission are you serious
4944
no bullshit thats not happening
4944
hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
4944
oh
4944
haha yeah thats fine i guess
4944
those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
4944
way to leave me hanging there
4944
for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
4944
for future reference
4944
yeah i know
4944
so when do i do my thing
4944
make this map
4944
which i guess is just like
4944
a solid black piece of paper
4944
this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
4944
alright
4944
so
4944
dog it as long as possible
4944
then travel back to about now and go to sleep
4944
what
4944
no
4944
oh yeah terezi
4944
no shes cool
4944
its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
4944
what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
4944
when did that happen
4944
who did that
4944
god
4944
fuckin trolls
4944
too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
4944
which ones yours
4944
is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
4944
yeah see what i mean
4944
oh ok
4944
well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
4944
ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
4944
when i feel like getting around to it i mean
4944
later
4991
ok
4991
what do you mean what
4991
but
4991
you know if im going to or not
4991
its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
4991
why dont you just tell me
4991
look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
4991
like doing the free will thing
4991
yes how would it ever stop being a thing
4991
being a things not something it ever stopped doing
4991
i just want to know whats really going on here
4991
before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
4991
ok i know but
4991
something about this doesnt add up
4991
who is this guy
4991
i dont remember sleeping on this bed
4991
or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
4991
so is he from the future
4991
does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
4991
which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
4991
and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
4991
do i have the stable loop right
4991
then what
4991
why wouldnt i be concerned about that
4991
if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
4991
and dead daves are the enemy remember
4991
says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
4991
who
4991
ok got it
4991
i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
4991
so if im understanding this
4991
this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
4991
and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
4991
so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
4991
must be from an offshoot timeline
4991
which means hes doomed
4991
ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
4991
what exactly did you do
4992
yeah i remember
4992
that seems like a long time ago already
4992
what was that like more than a day for me chronologically
4992
ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
4992
you just flipped a coin
4993
ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
4993
im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
4993
the arrangement being the coin flip thing
4993
thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
4993
i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
4993
oh yeah
4993
twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
4993
its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
4993
why dont you finish your story
4994
right exactly
4994
so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
4994
not seein it
4994
i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
4994
bad heads to mean youd show me later
4994
you said it came up bad heads
4994
so i was like ok i can wait
4994
and i did for like a whole day
4994
and now here you are showing me
4994
did i miss something
4995
then
4995
this is kind of useless isnt it
4995
i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
4995
whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
4995
its just the worst thing when you get morbid
4995
anyway maybe
4995
but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
4995
doomed means doomed doesnt it
4995
the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
4995
am i wrong in guessing that
4995
shouldnt you know better than me
4995
i dont know
4995
what does being a seer of mind actually mean
4995
oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
4995
lets not get derailed here
4995
we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
4995
punishing
4995
i guess
4996
i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
4996
see
4996
this shit youre doing now
4996
this is the morbid shit i was talking about
4996
its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
4996
even when you bracket smile after it
4996
like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
4996
ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
4996
i think
4996
this whole thing was a ruse
4996
and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
4996
i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
4996
and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
4996
so
4996
i guess
4996
well played??????
4996
i dont know
4996
just one question
4996
and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
4996
do i ever make the god tier
4996
like the right way
4996
ok
4996
then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
4996
i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
4997
alright then
4997
i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
4997
i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
4997
no fuck no
4997
put your fucking death coin away jesus
4997
i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
4997
what you didnt
4997
thats fucking idiotic
4997
you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
4997
this is bs
4997
so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
4997
is there anything else we need to do here
4997
i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
4997
probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
4997
then i guess thats where ill go
4997
ok
4997
i mean
4997
im not even actually mad i just
4997
i dunno
4997
i still dont really get what you did
4997
was the trick really necessary
4997
it sounds like
4997
the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
4997
and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
4997
get what
4997
yeah
4997
and
4997
i obviously still dont know
4997
i dont know sounds like a riddle
4997
fuck it ill just say all of it
4997
i mean that is the answer right
4997
oh ok
4997
really well
4997
i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
4997
means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
4997
oh do you
4997
is that what you were doing just now
4997
yeah no fuck
4997
man
4997
you are just
4997
some kind of knowitall arent you
4997
what else do you know
4997
like
4997
yeah because
4997
you didnt even look
4997
it was like
4997
schrodingers fucking coin
4997
and then
4997
it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
4997
yeah
4997
what
5041
yes perfect
5041
ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
5041
yeah
5041
now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
5042
its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
5042
you just know imigrants were responsible
5042
yeah see what i mean
5090
well that was apparently pointless
5090
now what
5090
hello
5090
terezi
5090
whats up
5104
this is a dave out there whats up
5104
it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
5104
sorry you had to see that
5104
but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
5104
i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
5104
ill be fine
5104
yes you are go ahead and be relieved
5104
nice
5104
yeah
5104
hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
5104
what
5104
my bro
5104
yeah jack killed him too
5104
not much to talk about
5104
this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
5104
even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
5104
yeah roses too
5104
i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
5104
bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
5104
makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
5104
where the fuck did that thing go
5104
fuck it never mind
5104
just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
5104
i guess
5104
meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
5104
fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
5104
always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
5104
but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
5104
if thats a thing
5104
like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
5104
but thanks
5104
i thought about taking his sword
5104
when i was there
5104
but i couldnt
5104
couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
5104
what
5104
you think
5104
well id like to
5104
but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
5104
there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
5104
im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
5104
then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
5104
once its time to put the end game in motion
5104
til then youre on your own for a while
5104
besides we cant beat him
5104
look what he did to bro and davesprite together
5104
im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
5104
johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
5104
and he stands no chance either
5104
only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
5104
guess i shouldnt really say
5104
since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
5104
yeah well
5104
suffice to say
5104
if we cant beat him
5104
all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
5104
which hopefully buys us some time
5104
to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
5104
kinda
5104
well
5104
youre about to do what youre about to do
5104
and im not going to tell you not to
5104
i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
5104
while knowing damn well you will anyway
5104
so ill just say
5104
whats next is up to you
5104
and if later you want to talk about it
5104
im here
5381
hey
5381
christ
5381
youre a fan of one of my websites arent you
5381
what asshole gave you my chumhandle
5381
also what was your favorite thing i did you liked
5381
and what did you think was so great about it
5381
also
5381
asl???
5381
oh holy shit ok youre a troll
5381
only trolls say theyre six i dont know whats up with you and that dumb fake age
5381
makes no sense bye
5381
cool story
5381
ok so 2=6 awesome joke hahahaha
5381
or wait maybe it was just a waste of time
5381
you people think im made of the stuff
5382
what
5382
yeah
5382
i think
5382
im gonna shut off my phone now cya
5382
uh
5382
what
5382
the fuck
5382
i remember this
5382
i remember shutting off my phone and never talking to you again
5382
but
5382
im still talking
5382
whats going on
5382
no its a dream
5382
im asleep
5382
or am i
5382
what is going on here
5382
why
5382
bs
5382
i dont see anything out there
5383
oh sup
5383
looks like youre a fairy
5383
thats cool
5384
these arent my shades anymore
5384
john gave me these new ones for my bday
5384
i remember that
5384
and i wasnt wearing this shirt
5384
it was this one
5384
howd it get like that
5384
i cant
5384
wait
5384
i wasnt wearing this actually
5385
i was wearing this suit
5385
no wait
5385
it was a black one
5385
yeah
5385
and i was playing sburb
5385
thats right
5385
and then i went to sleep at some point
5385
which is why im asleep now
5385
but
5385
if im dreaming
5385
then why am i not awake as my dream self
5385
shit
5385
this wasnt the suit i was wearing
5386
it was this ugly fucking rag
5386
and i went to take a nap
5386
terezi said id reach god tier
5386
or i guess show me why i wouldnt
5386
did it work is this part of the process somehow
5386
so then
5386
its just a stupid pointless dream
5386
wait
5386
oh yeah
5386
i woke up
5386
and then
5387
welp
5388
so then
5388
im dead
5388
then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
5388
its the afterlife
5389
ok
5389
what is going on over here then
5389
is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
5389
i dont remember this
5389
fuck
5389
lucky bastard
5389
so then i guess terezi tricked me
5389
it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
5389
but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
5389
is
5389
bro dead there
5389
like in reality
5389
like thats a thing that really happened
5389
also
5389
is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
5389
well
5389
dammit
5389
what did i do wrong
5389
aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
5389
whats he doing
5389
alpha me
5389
i am him
5389
i dunno
5389
yeah
5389
sorta
5389
maybe
5389
ok
5389
am i talking to someone there
5389
who
5389
probably
5389
terezi i guess
5389
i dunno
5389
would she do that
5389
was i
5389
so
5389
im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
5389
what about the other dead daves
5389
uh
5389
i think
5389
im up to my neck in dave already
5389
just being one
5389
still doesnt seem right though
5389
why are you even here like why are you showing me this
5389
but like
5389
if im seeing this
5389
shouldnt i be able to do something about it
5389
or stop it from happening or
5389
i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
5389
what do i do
5390
where are we now
5390
oh so this is the trollplanet
5390
pretty cool not really what i pictured
5390
i dont know its more subdued
5390
i pictured a lot more mayhem like
5390
a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
5390
hahaha
5390
can we not go to those parts
5390
awesome
5390
so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
5390
what is like
5390
the primary activity here
5390
that ghosts get their shit worked up over
5390
like
5390
where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
5390
boring
5390
just kidding that sounds cool
5390
what else
5390
it isnt
5390
ha
5390
haha
5390
i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
5390
yeah sure
5390
well
5390
how about later
5390
not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
5390
and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
5390
if thats ok and i guess also possible
5391
aw hell no
5391
is this who i think this is
5391
holy shit
5391
dude
5391
are those sick fires youre packing there
5391
you best not be bringin that fire into my bubble less you plan on dropping that shit
5391
i am your general fucking practitioner and doctors orders are to shut up and burn down my goddamn office
5391
ill break your brittle ass like a graham cracker and well roast smores over the flaming debris have i made myself clear
5391
dude
5391
gross
5391
so aradia just so were clear
5391
this is like a hellbubble right
5391
its my eternal punishment to have shitty rapoffs with this tool forever is that it
5391
i guess i had it coming for a flagrant lifetime spent being unbelievably fucking incredible at rap and just about practically everything else
5391
except not dying
5391
so is he dead
5391
he looks dead
5391
what about you
5391
you dont look dead
5391
are you dreaming
5391
so
5391
youre not dead
5598
oh my fucking god
5598
what do you mean what
5598
we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
5598
you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
5598
it was five seconds ago
5598
so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
5598
were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it
5598
whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
5598
no
5598
puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
5598
i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
5598
a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
5598
exactly
5598
i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
5598
didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
5598
i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
5598
behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
5598
my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
5598
the truth is a mystery
5598
tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
5598
they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
5598
im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
5598
its pretty simple
5598
im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
5598
filthiest thing you ever said
5598
forget it
5598
pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
5598
im not john remember
5598
im not a hero
5598
my bro was
5598
john is
5598
im not
5598
no
5598
fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
5598
pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
5598
if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
5598
taking it vertically means drawing more blood
5598
but horizontally means a clean break
5598
check it
5603
no fuck that
5603
im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily
5603
that is basically what i just did isnt it
5603
thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
5603
thats how all the best adventures get strung together
5603
you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
5603
that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
5603
i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
5603
no
5603
fuck that
5603
no
5603
fuck you
5603
go away
5603
what
5603
i dunno
5603
why are you even talking to me anyway
5603
aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
5603
oh
5603
bitten
5603
what
5603
that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
5603
almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
5603
the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
5603
why would i get mad at you
5603
ok
5603
but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
5603
how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
5603
i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
5603
for what
5603
before what happens
5603
you mean god tiering
5603
does something go wrong
5603
thats practically unthinkable
5603
but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
5603
the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
5603
it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
5603
which is weird
5603
no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
5603
and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
5603
even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
5603
what
5603
well ok
5603
and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done
5603
but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
5603
working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
5603
like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
5603
johns too nice to get mad
5603
rose spends all her time calculating
5603
too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
5603
jade is
5603
i dont even know
5603
probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
5603
if anything id bet she just needs protection
5603
im just wondering
5603
when does someone actually step up
5603
jacks got shit to pay for
5603
yeah i guess
5603
i guess it has been on my mind
5603
maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
5603
insisting someones gotta pay
5603
and its hard for me to disagree
5603
what things
5604
im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
5604
ive never heard any voices or anything
5604
anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
5604
just like
5604
so completely illegal
5604
wait
5604
why did i just say that stupid thing i said
5605
no i mean
5605
ok that came out wrong
5605
what were we talking about again
5605
right
5605
someone has to make him pay
5605
cant let him just go unpunished
5605
if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
5605
slammer means jail
5605
you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
5606
are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
5606
or some chalk or whatever
5606
wait
5606
fuck
5606
what
5606
no
5606
i know it doesnt
5606
im just saying
5606
what am i even saying here
5606
shit
5607
ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
5607
it is about justice though
5607
and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
5607
not just going after jack
5607
but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
5607
holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
5607
anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
5607
so
5607
ok
5608
not really
5608
no
5608
anyway
5608
its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
5608
i have other duties to attend to
5609
ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
5609
never mind
5609
oh
5609
yeah
5609
thats gotta be what im talking about
5609
probably
5609
i need to shut up now
5609
im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
5609
why dont we talk about your thing now
5609
what justice thing do you have to do
5609
yes
5609
just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
5609
farewell
5609
no i mean
5609
god damn it im not leaving
5609
farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
5609
can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
5609
thats what a real friend would do
5610
thank you
5610
that sounds awesome
5610
justice problems
5610
oh shit are you fucking serious
5610
no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
5610
she
5610
ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
5611
spidertroll
5611
youve decided to take her down then
5611
you dont sound that psyched about it
5611
are you feeling guilty
5611
like second guessing whether she deserves it
5611
hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
5612
are you sure about that
5612
there is no john vs dave thing though
5612
are you going to stop me too then
5612
hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
5612
are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
5612
what
5612
lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
5612
ok fine
5612
we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
5612
do you think she stands a chance against him
5612
then whats the big deal
5612
why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
5612
so why dont you go do it
5612
you mean you cant beat her in a fight
5612
i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
5612
are
5612
you asking me to reassure you about that
5612
cause i seriously dont have a clue
5612
i dont understand
5612
i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
5612
like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
5612
was that all an act
5612
of course the fuck not
5612
didnt you say youve killed people before
5613
ok
5613
id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
5613
to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
5613
it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
5613
so i dont know
5613
do you want me to tell you to be a better human
5613
or to be a better troll
5613
alright well all ill say is
5613
maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
5613
why dont you just do what you think you have to do
5613
and ill do the same
5613
speaking of which
5613
these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
5613
so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
5613
and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
5613
except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
5613
ie you right now
5613
if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
5613
does luck actually matter
5776
heres one for you
5776
its a whopper
5776
are you ready
5777
this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
5777
what
5777
no no
5777
ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
5777
why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
5777
there is
5777
ok whatever
5777
im talking about a dream i just had
5777
i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
5777
doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
5777
it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
5777
like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
5777
its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
5777
i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
5777
are you busy
5777
cool listen to this
5778
no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
5778
its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
5778
all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime
5778
no look
5778
i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
5778
yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
5778
i know
5778
it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
5778
it was about me dying repeatedly
5779
i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
5779
god this is so generically morbid
5779
im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
5779
well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
5779
i kept dying
5779
there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
5779
or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
5779
and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
5779
but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
5779
like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
5779
and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
5779
you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
5779
or that my beats might not be ill enough
5779
and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
5779
please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
5779
about what
5779
uh
5779
this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
5779
no
5779
i mean
5779
im not sure
5779
i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
5779
i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
5779
forget it
5779
ok
5779
so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
5779
and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
5779
it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
5779
what did you read
5779
what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
5779
so then youre consulting astrology books now
5779
oh my fucking god will you put that away
5779
theres not even much more to it
5779
i looked up into the sky
5779
didnt see anyone singing
5779
but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
5779
it was bright as hell even through my shades
5779
so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
5779
and thats it
5779
no
5779
not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
5779
it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
5779
what the fuck are you talking about
5779
ok somethings wrong
5779
this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
5779
this happened months ago
5779
does this mean im dead
5780
stop it
5780
this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
5780
am i dead or asleep
5780
god dammit
5780
yeah right
5780
i dont know
5796
i remember waking up here
5796
after getting shot
5796
then the cage bunny came
5796
he gave us the bomb
5796
whered he go anyway
5796
the bunnys a she
5796
dumb
5796
we were talking about who should go
5796
no
5796
wait
5796
wasnt i going to go
5796
is that what happened did i go and now im dead
5796
whats not quite
5796
that i didnt go or that im not dead
5796
no
5796
sure
5796
i did that
5796
because i wanted to
5796
and because i was supposed to
5796
yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
5796
without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
5796
hard to explain
5796
with all the time shit going on
5796
i dont try to understand your light shit do i
5796
havent we had this conversation already
5796
its jogging i guess
5796
its manboobs are jiggling a little
5796
what
5796
what am i really supposed to say
5796
hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
5796
then i die and youve got to make out with me
5796
that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
5796
what does that even mean
5796
wtf
5796
aspd
5796
oh no
5796
this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
5796
you dont know anything
5796
about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
5796
you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
5796
youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
5796
in your case probably
5796
its some delirious biznasty alright
5796
yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
5796
nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
5796
anyway
5796
im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
5796
none of this is that big a deal
5796
i just mentioned the basics to her
5796
that id stop time traveling soon
5796
break out of the loops
5796
not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
5796
i was never that cool with this
5796
you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable
5796
well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
5796
maybe id rather just be like
5796
the dave of guy
5796
you know just some dude
5796
i guess not
5796
guess i failed my quest then
5796
so im like
5796
now what bitches
5796
to nobody in particular i guess
5796
yes those exact bitches
5797
oh yeah
5797
i remember that now
5797
then i guess thats what happened
5797
i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
5797
is that wrong
5797
because i made the map so i know how to get there better
5797
ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
5797
will you just tell me whats going on
5797
well i am
5797
because i should
5797
or should have
5797
man what the fuck is going on
5797
am i dead or are you dead or what
5797
uh
5797
oh yeah
5797
we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
5797
so i could pilot it out there
5797
fly it into the sun
5798
but the chain was huge
5798
couldnt think of how to break it
5798
then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
5798
so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
5798
because thats all i fucking do is break swords
5799
but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
5799
and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
5799
like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
5800
see like that
5800
like i did again just there with my hand
5800
cause of dreambubbles
5800
remember when that happened
5801
then i took it and sliced the chain
5801
like this
5801
damn
5801
it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
5801
whoops
5801
yeah
5802
so then
5802
the moon started drifting away
5802
and i was going to fly up
5802
and take it to the sun
5802
and i said something to you
5802
or i was going to
5802
like say bye or something
5802
but you were just standing there not saying anything
5802
holding that ball of yarn
5803
and then
5803
oh
5803
god thats right
5804
come on
5804
knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
5804
god dammit
5804
that is so trite
5804
its like
5804
heres how bad this is
5804
were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie
5804
you made this even more armageddon than it already was
5804
sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her
5804
the bunny or the actress
5804
you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
5804
this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
5804
its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode
5804
so thats it
5804
im actually lying here on derse asleep
5804
and you went out there and blew up the sun
5804
and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
5804
so youre not dead
5804
then youre dreaming
5804
what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
5837
ok
5837
so all those questions you asked me
5837
getting me to remember
5837
you were just stalling me werent you
5837
so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you
5837
this sucks
5837
could you just please turn the thing around and come back
5837
we agreed id do it though
5837
or at least you pretended to agree
5837
just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn
5837
sports
5837
all im saying is
5837
no one likes a basketball hog
5837
i just think you should know
5837
that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
5837
its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
5837
you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
5837
is that the sort of ignominy you want
5837
see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports
5837
and yet
5837
such has been whats happened
5837
it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
5837
its me im the tight end
5837
and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
5837
the greedy qb is you
5837
but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
5837
the football prize
5837
no come on
5837
its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
5837
for best pile squad
5837
and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
5837
the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
5837
what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
5837
yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it
5837
there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
5837
almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon
5837
yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
5837
how do i wake back up
5838
ok then do it
5838
but this was my mission
5838
that doesnt make sense
5838
why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me
5838
theyve obviously been gunning for me too
5838
why do you think that
5838
but i dont want you to die
5838
this isnt right
5838
so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit
5838
what do you mean
5838
............
5838
what
5838
sure
5838
but
5838
if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up
5838
nah ill stay asleep a while
5838

5838
what
5838

hahahahaha
5927

5927
ahaha
5927
i cant even tell if youre trying to troll me with this or if you actually are having some weird emotional problem
5927
ok im telling you
5927
you need to watch this video
5927
the song isnt even supposed to be released for another year or something
5927
but i got it from an inside source
5927
this is as hot as it gets
5927
hang on lemme dig it up
5931
none of that really meant anything but ok
5931
also you have me confused for somebody else we never talked
5931
i guarantee i would have remembered you
5931
thats cool juggalo guy who i still cant quite tell is ironic about this or not
5931
but like i said either way its all good
5931
what
5931
what fears
5931
oh god
5931
did my bro put you up to this
5931
i should have guessed he might have a hand in some of these shitty trolling escapades
5931
hahaha jesus
5931
you are fucking insane
5931
so
5931
my bros idiotic ventriloquist dummy is responsible for this schizophrenic bullshit
5931

5931
welp
5931
that sounds about right
5931
better do what he says dude
5931
hahahahahahahaha
5931
you are either literally an insane psychopathic murderer or some kind of trolling savant
5931
time to block you now but lets do this again ok
5931
holy shit
5931
uh
6249
hahaha oh god
6249
oh my god we are never going to stop fucking with each other are we
6249
even without computers
6249
yo terezi weve got a grim reaper too
6249
shit isnt that novel
6249
i mean i think even a civilization full of the laziest sons of bitches are gonna make up a myth figure for death
6249
like oooh watch OUT death is coming for you hes got like
6249
a SKULL and shit
6249
i basically have no fucking imagination that sounds badass to me
6249
wait wait no how about hes got a BLACK ROBE too
6249
and a fuckin scythe to fuckin slash at you with in case you didnt die all the way or whatever
6249
daaaaaamn now youre talking bro
6249
lets go ahead stick that in our culture forever
6249
hell yes
6250
dude chill out we just got hornswoggled is all
6250
man what the hell even happened on this meteor anyway
6250
actually dont even tell me
6253
are you actually
6254
wait
6254
really
6254
ok
6254
i dont really have any orders to give though
6254
except for karkat to shut the hell up because that horseshit is more obnoxious in person than i ever imagined
6255
aw yeah
6255
i got sicknasty logistics up my sleeve
6255
i just call them stics fyi which is how you know im way savvy about them
6255
most of the stics im fine tuning atm involve rap though i should warn you
6255
but dave what if that dope as hell plan falls through i can hear you ask
6255
plan b
6255
involves drawing some shitty cartoons
6255
and not giving a fuck about stuff
6255
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
6255
rose i told you this dude is fucking incredible
6256
whoa really
6257
wait
6257
shes dead too
6257
you guys are so messed up
6257
wait has the juggalo troll been giving you guys fits like this or something
6257
like this is a thing
6257
like a pattern
6257
oh man one of you has got to sit me down and tell me what actually happened here it all just sounds fuckin amazing in sort of the stupidest way possible
6257
i mean like personal tragedies notwithstanding
6257
not really
6257
oh wait
6257
against all odds i sorta do
6257
mine actually did do that once
6257
when i was really young
6257
he made this stupid leather bib for me out of a goddamn horse
6257
for the ironies obviously
6257
yeah
6257
what
6257
well shit
6257
thats a hell of a mystery no one thought was a mystery and didnt even really need solving
6257
but damn if it didnt just get solved so nice work
6283
whos this guy
6284
is he dead
6285
what is he the mayor of anyway
6285
it kinda looks like he just made that sash himself
6596
hey
6597
anyone seen terezi around
6597
we were gonna do a thing
6597
but shes not around and not answering my messages
6597
on any one of the probably ten thousand computers lying around that they would show up on
6597
yes a thing
6597
shut up
6597
what about you have you seen her
6597
are you serious
6597
of course not
6597
i havent seen that guy at all since the first day we got here
6597
not once
6597
talk about an elusive juggalo
6597
probably like the shyest fuckin juggalo of all time
6597
im pretty sure only karkats seen him
6597
dont expect him to rat him out either because of the "morail" junk
6597
moirail?
6597
mwah rail...
6597
alien words
6597
yeah
6597
i mean i bet you think youre imparting some really obscure cultural fact about trolls
6597
but really if a human said to another human
6597
"hey man can you tell me where your best clown friend is hiding so i can go chainsaw him to death"
6597
just fyi that would probably be bad form too
6597
i dunno its been a year already i think hes really intent on hiding
6597
and hanging on to those dead bodies
6597
hes probably scared to death of you at this point anyway
6597
maybe you should just let it go
6597
rose back me up
6597
interpersonal
6597
wait
6597
are you saying this is like
6597
a spade quadrant thing
6597
is she trying to be his kismet fish
6597
well if she hates him isnt that what that means
6597
haha no im not shes cool
6597
look shes being cool about it
6597
see????
6597
yeah see i knew there had to be a perfectly harmless and unerotic explanation
6598
got it
6598
so what are you up to in here
6598
whats with all these books
6598
hell yeah
6598
we looted one of them for the can town project
6598
i told you about can town didnt i
6598
well
6598
the thing about can town
6598
and all there really is to say about can town is
6598
its awesome
6598
the end???
6598
fu
6598
so
6598
what is the point of this research
6598
i thought you pretty much already knew the situation
6598
since you can see the future
6598
yes you can
6598
you totally can
6598
no thats totally dumb
6598
i could know things about the future if i time traveled and found out first hand
6598
nobodys mistaking that about me im a time traveler not a fuckin fortune teller its simple as shit
6598
ok whatever
6598
nice
6598
uh
6598
now?
6598
yeah that would be pretty legit of us
6598
ok i didnt really catch any of that bullshit cause i wasnt listening
6598
im gonna make myself a cup of coffee and get primed to listen to you saying a lot of stuff like that
6598
do you want some
6599
kanaya?
6599
ok
6599
...
6599
this fuckin thing
6599
where did you even unearth this piece of shit from
6600
oh ok there it goes
6600
two hot revitalizing cups of shitty coffee
6600
fresh out of the weird pod
6600
why do we even drink this shit
6600
i guess just cause this thing is here
6600
like somehow the temptation is even stronger because the coffee sucks?
6600
dunno how the fuck that works
6600
wish there was such a thing as apple juice on troll world
6600
could go for a bottle of aj
6600
i wonder if theres any booze squirreled away on this meteor
6600
kinda feels like we should be drinking our asses off here
6600
no adults nothing to do
6600
thats what you do without adults right
6600
get wasted all the time?
6600
wait what the fuck am i saying trolls dont even have adults
6600
well they do
6600
but theyre all in outer space being insane badasses
6600
i guess they do have the stupid nanny monsters
6600
do the monsters give a shit if they get wasted
6600
what
6600
oh
6600
off the shit is how
6600
all being like
6600
in cups and everything
6601
so whats with the big book youre writing in
6601
is that more wizard fan fiction
6601
so its like
6601
your nigh unreadable gamefaq
6601
in tome form
6601
you sure like to write big game guides
6601
i guess
6601
ehh
6601
chances of that seem pretty remote
6601
ok totally sold on that suddenly
6601
on account of not caring
6601
so tell me about the new session
6601
what is there to know
6601
and most importantly
6601
how is everything going to go wrong this time
6601
ok but i thought the whole point of this
6601
the scratch thing
6601
is it gave us a chance to still win
6601
but youre saying the new session has a fault too?
6602
ok
6602
which is what
6602
weird
6602
why would these alt universe players fuck up in such an obvious and stupid way
6602
didnt you say at some point that not prototyping anything would be really bad
6603
still waiting to hear how this is in any way an improvement on all the shit we just escaped from
6603
jade has our battlefield right
6603
so she shows up and drops it in skaia
6603
and then we take the result of all that damn frog breeding we did and stick the thing in there somehow
6603
and we sit back and wait for it to do its huge ribbit or whatever
6603
and were golden
6604
is that going to be a problem
6604
ok but
6604
conspiracies aside
6604
did it ever really look like clear sailing to you
6604
thats not what i was seeing
6604
we are going to arrive and then soon after jack is going to show up
6604
and then we have to beat him right
6604
so there kind of is a time limit
6605
oh
6605
why not
6605
so
6605
no meteors came at all
6605
you mean by fucking up and having to scratch we also sort of saved earth in the process
6605
i see
6605
what about the players themselves
6605
they had to arrive on meteors too didnt they
6605
i guess the baby meteors were some exceptions too right
6606
................
6606
what do you mean tweak the destination times
6606
where did they get sent to
6606
what
6607
uh
6607
so
6607
uh
6607
in this alt universe group of us and
6607
them
6607
which ones are the actual players
6607
fuck
6607
why did i know that was gonna be the answer
6607
i dunno if im ready to process the ramifications of this bullshit
6608
man
6608
at least im used to dealing with alt daves
6608
ive been fuck deep in alt daves before
6608
its a goddamn delight if you want to know the truth
6608
but i dont even know what to think about...
6608
lets not even talk about it ok
6608
can we slow down this meteor
6608
delay the meetup
6608
maybe fight jack for a little while
6608
but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason
6608
she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing
6608
let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE
6608
fine well you can be on bro duty then
6608
ill be the ambassador to your mom
6608
and no that wasnt actually meant as the sick burn it sounded like
6608
yeah i know
6608
ill be the ambassador to my mom then
6608
that sounds pretty stupid when i say it that way
6608
whatever
6608
ill be the fuckin one man welcome wagon for the john and jade teen old people and also our mom thats the plan
6608
so when we finally see them we can get our shit into formation like trained acrobats
6608
like ill blow a whistle and we make a human pyramid got it
6608
that way we can totally avoid anything awkward
6608
what
6608
when
6608
wait that was her
6608
oh
6608
huh
6608
.....
6608
no
6608
god fucking dammit
6608
no what a load of shit
6608
stuff said between you and me before we knew we were related
6608
we both know that was a lot of horseplay bullfuckery between like smartass 10 year olds or whatever
6608
you cant seriously have taken any of that seriously
6608
ugh dont ever do that
6608
all these fuckin
6608
momtraps and sistertraps
6608
what a joke i hope skaia gets to have a good laugh over shit like this
6608
wait i forgot skaia doesnt laugh it just "sees" and "knows"
6608
its like a huge blue perv thats mad jazzed for kidcest
6608
dont you wink at her
6608
kanaya heres a protip that wink meant jack dick shes just being weird
6608
yeah im pretty much ollying outie too
6608

7302
(unfettered descents what it considers perfection)
7302
(shit thinks of the ground and it gets an erection)
7302
(best hope its carpet bound in its downward spiral)
7302
(cause linoleums frowned on, met with an eyeroll)

rose dont drink so loud its messing up my raps
7303
i can actually hear your sips through my headphones
7303
oh my god
7303
you are so fucking hammered
7303
how strong did you even make that stuff
7304
pretty strong
7304
rose you just bootlegged some fucking rubbing alcohol
7304
faculity isnt a word check mate
7304
this kinda strikes me as a sort of misappropriation of alchemy
7304
like fucking with the mystical technology of creation to whip up some moonshine just seems
7304
i dunno man
7304
tell me you at least alchemized a bathtub first to stir this shit in
7304
at least that would be hilarious
7304
and where the FUCK is my applejuice rose
7304
gotta say
7304
you really let me down on the aj front
7304
bullshit it was hard
7304
whats so hard about applejuice its like
7304
the most basic goddamn juice
7304
like the square one of juice
7304
uh
7304
well shit
7304
looks like i wandered into a really weird uncharted side of town tonight
7304
its called the drunk rose district
7304
and i am scared out of my fucking mind
7304
no!
7304
i told you i dont want any of your experimental fucking spacewizard booze
7304
id rather not go blind
7304
then terezi will have to teach me to lick shit to see
7304
is that what you want do you want me licking everything in sight
7304
like oh hey mayor SLURP oh fuck youre not the mayor youre my goddamn sister
7305
oh my god
7305
you laughed way too hard at that it wasnt anywhere close to that funny
7305
i think youve had enough
7305
good lord
7305
i still dont know why you were so bent on making this liquor
7305
i thought you werent really that down with the drinkin
7305
you never liked it when your mom drank what happened to that
7305
ok so why
7305
why tonight do you just decide to get completely wasted before you
7305
like
7305
are you nervous about your date with kanaya is that it
7305
uh
7305
yes
7305
rose
7305
you are wearing a friggin prom dress
7305
and nervously drinking your ass off
7305
while you are waiting for kanaya to arrive
7305
for a goddamn DATE
7305
this is infuriating
7305
why do you even bother with this stupid charade
7305
you could be at like a drive in movie making out with each other
7305
all exchanging class rings while giving birth to each others fucking children
7305
and you would still be all coy like IS IT A DATE OR ISNT IT HMMMM WHO CAN REALLY SAY FOR SURE???
7305
yeah
7305
that turned out to be one hell of a sip
7305
maybe you should just reschedule
7305
just sleep it off there are more hot dates where that came from
7305
im just not sure youre gonna make the best impression like this
7305
come on lets just find you a suitably soft pile of objects to sleep in before she
7305
aw shit
7305
shes here
7306
omfg i cant even deal
7306
(rose i think you started drinking way too early)
7306
(i think you just like)
7306
(completely fucking forgot to tell kanaya you were dressing up)
7306
(man youre gonna make her so uncomfortable all dolled up like that not to mention three sheets to the fucking wind)
7306
(this date is going to be so awkward)
7306
(yeah sure)
7306
(SMH)
7308
holy shit we got a room full of smooth operators here tonight
7308
yes kanaya it was going to be a romantically oriented date
7308
but as you can see rose is hooched to the fucking max
7308
so i think youre better off going out another time
7308
ugh
7308
you seriously still wanna go through with this
7308
a problem
7308
uh
7308
i dunno if youre cool with your date slurring words and making no damn sense about apples then
7308
i guess not???
7308
why are you both looking at me
7308
stop that
7308
no dont
7308
hey i am not your fucking life coach here
7308
if you want to go on a drunkdate what do i care
7308
man what do i even know about "human courtship" anyway
7308
not like i ever dated a fuckin human
7308
so i guess have at it
7308
awesome
7308
datenite with drunky it is
7308
go apeshit i guess
7308
uh so
7308
what should i do here
7308
you want me to pack up my raps and leave you alone or
7835
my pants
7835
what are you talking about
7835
theyre on my legs
7835
oh
7835
what
7835
for rose?
7835
uh yeah kind of
7835
man terezi doesnt need an intervention
7835
she just drinks a lot of soda
7835
its red fizzy shitwater dude who cares
7835
terezi has made her choices
7835
among them was to begin guzzling untold liters of that putrid circus cola
7835
think of it as like a rite of passage
7835
like something that just goes with the territory when someone you know almost imperceptibly begins turning into a juggalo
7835
wait fuck
7835
maybe she does need an intervention
7835
did you try kicking her
7835
im out of ideas
7836
man i dunno
7836
sounds like you wanna make this needlessly melodramatic
7836
speaker crab
7836
man dont put me on speaker crab
7836
god
7836
honestly she can do whatever she wants i put this all behind me a while ago
7836
why do you really want me in on this conversation is it just that you dont know what to say by yourself
7836
what
7836
hahaha thats what you think that does?
7836
no dude thats not what gift of gab does
7836
its utility isnt really comprehensible to lowly mortals sorry
7836
nah
7837
what do you actually want from her
7837
do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber
7837
or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good
7837
yeah i can understand where youre coming from
7837
but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody
7837
and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that
7837
like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news
7837
and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens
7837
look all im saying is
7837
there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay
7837
terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear
7837
shes down with the clown
7837
its true man
7837
you can live in denial for only so long
7837
but as your bro i have to say it like it is
7837
she and gamzee man
7837
that is literally a thing
7837
they are in the hate square together
7837
total kismespades dude
7837
oh
7837
really?
7837
then what the fuck have i been tiptoeing around all this time god damn
7837
i thought this was supposed to be like this "big secret" that would "destroy you" if you found out
7837
then why is it a problem now
7837
what
7837
like i said i just put it behind me
7837
she started sneaking around in vents and stuff acting suspicious trying to hide the fact that she was seeing him
7837
like she was obviously ashamed of it and worried how id react
7837
but it was hella transparent that was going on so i just said
7837
thats fine yall can do your blackrom thing with the juggalo its your decision
7837
but i cant keep playing along
7837
i cant do the quadrant thing its just too weird for me
7837
im not a troll and im not all open minded about gettin multicultural
7837
i still dont understand the spades thing and it makes me really fuckin uncomfortable even trying to imagine how that works and i sure as fuck dont want to date anybody whos got a hateclown on the side
7837
so i said no hard feelings i still like you and all, do whatever makes you happy ill just be over here in the hyper gravity chamber training to beat lord english
7837
no
7837
but what about you
7837
havent you been talking to gamzee this whole time
7837
or is he just balls out lying to you about sneakin around the meteor with terezi
7837
i thought moirails were supposed to be open with each other about stuff like that
7837
oh shit
7837
sorry to hear about that
7837
amazing i spent three years on this rock and never said one thing to the guy
7837
i saw him once tho
7837
just a glimpse in a dark hallway
7837
it was kinda like seeing a blurry purple bigfoot with a huge boner
7837
why is he wearing it
7837
ahahaha the best thing we ever do together is slam this assholes dumb religion
7837
really its the most hilarious fucking horseshit ive ever heard
7837
i mean pretty much all religions are wrong but theres wrong and then theres WRONG
7837
as in ZERO CHANCE YOU ARE EVER PROVEN RIGHT ABOUT EVEN A SINGLE THING DUDE, EVER EVER EVER
7837
be one sad clown that day
7837
his bulge will probably deflate and make this high pitch noise plus corresponding flatulence
7837
what do you mean as friends
7837
uh
7837
yeah?
7837
no offense dog but thats a dumb and neurotic question
7837
you forgot the mayor
7837
youre pretty damn tight with the mayor arent you
7837
yeah the mayor rules
7837
but as usual you are overcomplicating this
7837
just like you overcomplicate everything
7837
friendship leadership romance
7837
shipping grids and dick battles
7837
this is real simple
7837
our meteor will somehow tokyo drift to a dead stop in the new session
7837
at which point we will keep being bros for life or something
7837
i will start being friends with john and jade again because they are my friends and never stopped being that
7837
john will also be your friend because hes cool and also a doofus who is easy to be friends with
7837
jade will be your friend too cause shes nice and likes being friends with people
7837
i can personally guarantee that she will be happy to see you
7837
and as for the new people i dont know about them but theyll probably be your friends too
7837
all i know is two of them are my parents and two of them are johns parents and aint no rule that says you cant be friends with your bros mom and pop
7837
especially when your bros mom and pop are a couple of sassy teens
7837
as for terezi i dont know i guess well see what happens
7837
and as for gamzee fuck that guy with a balloon poodle
7837
friendship lesson secured the end
7918
yeah dude you should probably ditch the chair
7918
or at least sit on it frontways
7918
or offer her another chair?
7918
i dunno its kind of a dumb affectation in this context
7918
to sit on the goddamn floor
7918
so you can be on the same vertical plane with your friend while you exhibit compassion for her grody clown problem
7918
karkat just threw a tantrum about a chair
7918
i just won karkat tantrum bingo
7919
where did you even get that chair
7919
did you steal it from the common area
7919
sounds like communism
7919
are you a communist or something
7919
actually that makes perfect sense what with your sickle and all
7919
wait john has a hammer oh shit its all adding up
7919
when we arrive are you going to team up with john and seize the means of production
7919
im just saying
7919
first chairs what next
7919
see i am all about private property and pocketing dough
7919
do you have any idea how rich i am
7919
i am a man of MEANS motherfucker
7919
just dont come after my boonies dude
7919
or should i say karkat marx
7919
i dont have much to say about this
7919
ive kinda got to recuse myself on the matter
7919
im all kinds of on record as being squicked out by the idea of hatelationships
7919
so i got no point of reference for gauging when one is fucked up the way thats normal for trolls or if its fucked up cause its actually fucked up and terrible
7919
this is like some ex alien boyfriend prime directive shit
7919
i cant intervene cause i dont know what im talking about
7919
but you do so i guess keep going
7919
you were saying some pretty good stuff before i started riding your jock about chairs
7919
thank you
7919
intermission?
7919
its not an intervention either
7919
my ghostly heads all beamin out of this crab for moral support yo
7919
i am in my homies corner even if he is a massive socialist
7919
terezi i think can probably figure this out
7919
she grew up alone and blind in a forest i think she will manage to bounce outta her juggalo phase
7919
but yeah terezi you should at least quit the fuckin soda
7921
what
7921
dont blame me
7921
i cant control the crab
8124
so
8124
has anyone figured out how were actually gonna stop this meteor
8124
or was three years not enough time to solve that problem
8124
i dont think thats possible dude
8124
in fact im not sure we were ever traveling at light speed
8124
i think maybe theres been some bogus science in circulation that we been chumped into gettin behind
8124
just saying
8125
man pull it together
8125
this thing has to have some escape pods or something
8125
or i guess maybe we could
8125
just sort of
8125
hop up
8125
and
8125
like...
8125
fly away?
8125
i swear to god
8125
this meteor needs one of those baby on board things on the back
8125
but like a grub instead of baby for max fidelity to the gag because TROLLZ
8125
i know you cant fly dude obviously i would just carry you or something
8125
rose shut the fuck up
8126
dude did you just bark
8126
why would i bark
8126
because youre having a mental breakdown
8126
nah
8126
wasnt me
8126
kanaya did you bark
8126
you fuckin with us maryam
8126
maybe the mayor barked
8126
mayor was that you
8126
haha i bet it was
8126
god i love the mayor hes so full of surprises
8180

8180
it has dumb crocodiles
8180
and a stock market

8180
lofaf?
8180
land of frost and frogs
8180

8180
(fyi i just hi fived him for like the third time in a row to my recent recollection)
8180
so whats the last thing you actually do remember
8180
right
8180
me too
8180
but she was like a fuckin werewolf or something
8180
wait
8180
then she zapped us to that stonehenge place
8180
yeah
8180
we all landed in some grass like a pile of fuckups
8180
and then
8180
damn
8180
then what happened
8180
what the hell happened to john
8181
so are you just as brain damaged as we are
8181
me and karkat
8181
ok
8181
so you have no idea how you got to lofaf then
8181
im talking to karkat
8181
yeah but i dont think thats the memory loss issue thats just him being an idiot
8181
but lets not get into that
8181
wheres rose
8181
oh
8181
what about terezi
8181
do they remember what happened
8181
what
8181
how
8181
friggin seers
8181
all makin us knights look bad
8181
and whatever you are
8181
what were you again
8181
what the dick is a sylph
8181
but witches are already magical arent they
8181
like by definition
8181
oh wait thats the joke i guess
8181
god damn this missing time shit is makin me feel dumb as hell
8181
ok good
8181
so what do the seers think happened
8181
oh god
8181
is she still drunk
8181
ok
8181
wow youre right
8181
haha wtf
8181
man i cant even describe it
8181
its not just that her text is unreadable gibberish
8181
i mean it is
8181
but its more than that
8181
its like
8181
existentially inscrutable somehow
8181
i think we may have a problem here
8202
so weird being back here
8202
cant believe how long ago it feels since i lived in this place
8202
spent way too long wallowing in our own filth on that gnarly meteor thats for sure
8202
this doesnt even seem like my room anymore
8202
its like trespassing or something like im horning in on somebody elses life
8202
a life lived most sweetly though i will admit
8202
ahahaha the fuckin toilets still there
8202
i remember when jade put that there that is perhaps like my favorite memory
8202
wish jade wasnt crazy just makes me remember how much i miss not crazy jade
8202
or less crazy jade
8202
wait
8202
didnt karkat once say terezi ripped a troll toilet out of his house
8202
what is with girls and their universally constant tendency to rip out plumbing fixtures
8202
did i just accidentally crack another cosmic riddle or
8202
i gotta txt him and get confirmation on this asap
8202
actually nah
8202
i probably harangued the poor guy with enough of my bs the last few years
8202
ill just keep shufflin thru memory lane making wistful observations out loud
8202
you know it kinda chaps my bulge that people rip on me for talking to myself
8202
its like the most perfectly natural thing to do
8202
why are people so up tight about keepin a lid on their monologues what a bunch of stuffy pricks
8202
ive always found the sound of my own voice to be mysteriously soothing
8202
haha talk about an embarrassing sentence to say in earshot of an actual person
8202
well maybe not the mayor
8202
you can always tell the mayor anything <3
8203
hahaha this piece of shit is still here too
8203
didnt we use this thing like ONCE
8203
what a useless pile of trash in hindsight
8203
sometimes i think this game was designed by an idiot
8203
wasnt it called like
8203
the laserbeam intellivision or something
8203
id throw it in the lava but that would be a waste of melting
8204
oh yeah
8204
almost forgot about my ill beats from the past
8204
i wonder if theyre as ill as i remember
8204
ok i just pushed some buttons and verified they remain as ill as the day they were dropped
8204
ill have to send them to karkat he has always been an enthusiastic patron of my exceptional science
8204
i mean sure he says it sucks and maybe he even believes that on some pathetic sub intellectual plane of consciousness which gross philistines operate on their whole lives
8204
but whenever he gets a load of my hype
8204
i see him there
8204
tapping his foot ever so slightly
8204
i see him
8205
this poster...
8205
love this poster
8205
its like an old friend
8205
never even knew who these guys were or what their deal was
8205
never gave it much thought i guess
8205
doubt ill ever find out at this point
8205
oh well
8205
some things i guess were never meant to be figured out
8205
or benefit from any kind of elaboration
8205
not even years later
8205
just the way it is sometimes
8205
its like ive said before
8205
this poster is a hell of a mystery
8205
that i never even thought was a mystery
8205
and it would be pretty cool if somebody solved it
8205
but damn if thats ever gonna happen
8205
so thats a shame
8206
aw hell its my old dead things collection
8206
what a stupid blast from the past
8206
i seriously cannot remember if i was sincere with this shit
8206
i was probably trying to flex my underdeveloped irony muscles
8206
like the shrimpiest kid at the hipster gym
8206
why does my childhood room have to be such a predictable museum of embarrassments
8206
i dont know
8206
some of these things are kind of cool actually
8206
like from a standpoint of objective reevaluation afforded by the sobering maturity that comes with being literally 100% grown up now
8206
dead things are actually pretty rad
8206
i feel like if i was legitmately into all this then more should have come of the interest
8206
like there could have been like
8206
entire CONVERSATIONS about it that never even took place
8206
hey rose youll never guess what im excited about and have loads of dialogue to spill over
8206
whats that dave
8206
ancient mollusks
8206
hmmmmmmmm said rose
8206
how many bananas do you think this paw clutched back when it was alive and attached to a monkey
8206
dave i really must say
8206
this conversation blows
8206
yeah sorry
8206
maybe i could have really developed this interest
8206
maybe i could have been something cool as a result
8206
like what even profession is this
8206
a dead shit ogler?
8206
no wait
8206
probably a paleontologist or something
8206
i could have been a paleontologist
8206
instead of what i became
8206
which was
8206
uh
8206
some pajama packing fuckface from the renaissance fair
8206
that would have been the dopeness!
8207
eurgh
8207
the ironic selfies
8207
oh god
8207
now this
8207
this is some irredeemably mortifying shit here
8207
what was i thinking
8207
i dont know man
8207
i just dont know
8207
this is what seasoned veterans call "bad irony"
8207
look at this guy
8207
what a fucking novice
8208
oh who am i kidding
8208
i cant stay mad at that face
8209
ok this one is pretty funny actually
8209
...
8209
eheheh
8210
hehehehe
8211
haha!
8211
hahahahahaha!
8212
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
8212
WHY
8212
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
8212
(gasp)
8212
WHY CANT
8212
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
8212
WHY CANT I STOP LAUGHING
8212
PFFFFAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
8213
YOU WIN!
8213
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
8213
YOU WIN YOUNG DAVE
8213
THESE SELFIES ARE COMEDY GOLD
8213
AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
8215
whoa
8215
john
8215
what
8215
no
8215
i mean i was just laughing too hard at something dumb
8215
you know how it is
8215
no its nothing
8215
where the fuck have you been
8215
do you remember what happened since we got here
8215
well
8215
are you gonna fill me in or keep floating there in the most uninformative way possible
8215
what
8215
why
8215
john wait
8216
no dont
8216
john no stop turning into wind you fickle idiot
8216
dont just leave right away that is such an insanely predictable move
8216
i said get back here you slippery motherfucker!!!
8217
god dammit
8218
no
8218
look all i know is egbert most definitely didnt just appear out of nowhere and catch me weeplaughing at my selfies
8218
i keep my apparment misted with his odor at all times
8218
essence d'egbert
8218
no like the french pronunciation
8218
anyway im just a lot more comfortable when my whole place reeks of nerd musk
8218
so that explains that
8218
you did
8219
where
8220
what work
8220
what
8220
you mean the deringer
8220
i thought it was like the best possible sword
8220
or at least the best possible broken sword
8220
uh
8220
not really?
8220
lots of ways
8220
we could have a jade goes back to normal party
8220
starring normal jade
8220
ok here
8221
how do we make it so it can damage him
8221
and you know what that is
8221
how
8221
i dont understand how this is working
8221
is she piping all these secrets into your brain
8221
along with the evil
8221
fair enough
8221
i guess technically almost nothing is relevant to the dude youre barking orders to
8221
literal barking because of dogginess
8221
yes exactly like that
8221
thank you for participating in the joke
8221
now what is this special ingredient and where do we get it
8221
oh yeah?
8222
no
8222
no!
8222
ive never seen that thing before
8222
i didnt take your lousy egg
8222
yeah well these planets are crawling with brainless lizards maybe one of them thought it was an egg
8222
and then brought it here cause its warm here and tried to hatch it
8222
what things
8222
what are you talking about
8222
come on dont compare me to him
8222
just cause i think its an eggy looking thing dont mean i think like a damn bird
8222
.....................
8222
do you actually want snausages
8222
ok well snausages notwithstanding this is bullshit
8222
tell me how that thing doesnt look like an egg to you
8222
how is that not so obviously SUCH an egg???
8222
i see
8222
so if im following
8222
then what youre trying to tell me is
8222
lord english has some sort of severe egg allergy that we are hoping to exploit
8222
can we just make the eggsword already
8223
oh no
8223
not the legendary piece of shit again
8223
its the fuckin welsh sword again!
8223
i dont know!
8223
because i have a shitty quest is how
8223
didnt davesprite tell you anything
8223
i found this sword in a gold cave and broke it
8223
then davesprite took it to hephaestus who fixed it and upgraded it to the deringer
8223
and sent that to me and i broke it again
8223
i know!!!
8223
that has always been my thing for some reason
8223
now i guess it turns out my ultimate sword is really just a repaired downgrade of my previously ultimate sword mixed with a cueball?
8223
we just cycled right back to caledfwelsh like a bunch of tools
8223
that is the most stupid convoluted ass backward way to get a sword out of a stone i can even imagine
8223
i feel like somebody somewhere is having a good laugh over this i sure hope like the juggalo equivalent of fuckin loki or whoever the fuck is having a top notch riddlewank at my expense
8223
you know what really gets me is
8223
this shitty welsh sword presumably consisted of those ingredients all along which just makes me want to travel back in time to perform a mutually assisted suicide with myself
8223
me and other dave can take turns suffocating each other with our own DUMBASS capes
8223
jade this is STUPID
8223
my quest is a STUPID PIECE OF GARBAGE QUEST for LAME SHITTY LOSER FUCKHEADS WHO SUCK BALLS WHILE CRAPPING THEIR PANTS
8223
...
8223
i need help :(
8283
why
8283
wait since when could you use a sword
8283
also
8283
whats up with that dumb sword
8283
how
8283
ohh
8283
yeah no
8283
i climbed a few yeah
8283
which ones do you have
8283
show me your badges and you can see mine
8283
i want to scope out this universal specibus badge that sounds pretty cool actually
8283
oh yeah
8283
its pretty easy to forget sometimes tho
8283
i think were getting sidetracked by the kiddie camper shit
8283
are you really suggesting that we do an actual sword fight right now
8283
like for training purposes
8284
will you cut it out with the evil jade baloney
8284
im not going to fight you
8284
my rooftop dueling days are OVER
8284
ugh
8284
even if we just went balls out jackass BANANAS with our swords here i mean realistically how much appreciable advancement in my battle skills would even result from that
8284
are you actually thinking this through or just going through the vaguely nefarious motions that come with the territory of being evildog!jade
8284
yeah you probably will
8284
youll probably annihilate me worse than my bro used to
8284
dont you have all of your dogs insane powers and like
8284
god tier space powers on top of all that
8284
how exactly am i supposed to compete with that
8284
no!
8284
ok here i go
8284
wait
8284
nah
8284
i told you
8284
im not time traveling
8284
i think im giving it up for good actually
8285
im serious
8285
the thing is
8285
being a time guy
8285
like actually MASTERING time travel
8285
im pretty sure what that involves is
8285
learning to never use it
8285
see its like karate
8285
well
8285
its more like what they SAY about karate
8285
that you learn it so you dont use it
8285
but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time
8285
like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can
8285
its a god damn no brainer thats what you do with karate
8285
but see with time travel
8285
all the stuff about learning it so you dont have to use it is true
8285
theres no good that can come of it
8285
you can crunch the logic on the loops all you want
8285
but all youre doing is painting yourself into a corner
8285
creating inevitabilities you have to rehearse and enact or face death for yourself or everyone you know
8285
and sometimes facing death is the very inevitability you have to rehearse
8285
and then you wait and wait knowing its coming and knowing it has to happen
8285
how do you think it made me feel when we were gathering up all those frogs
8285
and i knew the whole time in a little while you would have to watch me get shot
8285
but i couldnt say anything or it would mess it all up
8285
all cause i thought it would be cool to be marty mcfuckin fly
8285
but instead of shredding johnny b goode on guitar to get my parents to bang
8285
my crowning performance was doing a funny dance while getting pumped full of lead
8285
then i had to leave everyone behind and get into the delorean and return to the 1980s
8285
but the delorean was actually a big purple moon
8285
and the 1980s was me accidentally reaching god tier and living on a shitty meteor for a while
8285
and i guess rose was doc brown
8285
doc brown accidentally reached god tier too
8285
ok i guess this is where the analogy falls apart but you get what i mean
8285
damn
8285
ok lemme start over
8285
why is that safe to expect
8285
where are all these presumptions coming from
8285
if you can use swords why dont you take the welsh cueball sword and fight him yourself
8285
i bet you could fuck him up
8285
youre probably even more extra strong now that youve succumbed to the bark side
8285
did you ever think about that
8285
the empress can suck it
8285
i have no intention of fighting him
8285
and this isnt even me pulling more lame self aware reluctant hero junk
8285
i am just straight up not going to do it
8285
see thats not reluctance its just petulant refusal on my part
8285
reluctant hero shit is when the guys like aw shucks i dunno if i wanna but deep down we all know he really does
8285
but i really dont
8285
why should i
8285
i dont give a damn about lord english or his nebulous atrocities out in nowherespace
8285
what kind of villain is someone you never met who hardly did anything evil to you or your friends directly
8285
or even to anyone in your universe for that matter other than through some vague insidious influence
8285
who even is this guy and why should i hate him
8285
am i really supposed to be pissed off at a green muscle monster i never met
8285
cause i aint pissed off at no muscle monster
8285
hell wasnt he in some ass backwards way responsible for us existing in the first place?
8285
or all of humanity for that matter??
8285
maybe i should thank him before chopping him up via welshscalibur
8286
what
8286
why are you dragging that guy into this
8286
what happened with you and him anyway
8286
it kind of is
8286
hes bird me
8286
that clearly means i have a right to know
8286
you said he had issues
8286
what issues
8286
was he talking shit about me the whole time or something
8286
i know he resents me for being the real dave
8286
man i knew it
8286
i knew he was poisoning your view of me all those years
8286
and i wasnt there to say anything or defend against his slander so now of course you think im a neurotic douche
8286
yeah but i only started acting like a neurotic douche like half way through this conversation
8286
you clearly had an axe to grind with me from the start and i want to know why
8286
what did i ever do to deserve this shit from you
8286
what
8286
i did
8286
when
8286
whoa no way
8286
thats such an unfair characterization we are completely different dudes
8286
no i know
8286
i was playing the "hes bird me" card because it was convenient to whatever it was i was saying at the time
8286
i forget what point i was making when i said that
8286
but thats not the point im making now
8286
he and me are just
8286
crazy different yo
8286
hes got fuckin wings!!!
8286
he also presumably takes a dump and lays eggs out of the same ghostly hole
8286
...
8286
ew man whyd i have to go there
8286
ok if he broke up with you or whatever that was because of his dumb bird issues not my issues
8286
theres no way i would have done that to you
8286
my issues are totally different and probably way more serious
8286
i dont see anyone ordering him to master time travel or trying to pawn brittle welsh swords off on him do you
8286
nobody is telling him hes got to murder the incredible hulk
8286
did you tell him hes got to murder the incredible hulk jade
8286
no i think not
8287
hey
8287
what are you doing
8287
dont you dare touch the mayor
8287
GET AWAY FROM HIM!
8290

8302
i told you
8302
im not time traveling
8302
i think im giving it up for good actually
8303
im serious
8303
the thing is
8303
being a time guy
8303
like actually MASTERING time travel
8303
im pretty sure what that involves is
8303
learning to never use it
8303
see its like karate
8303
well
8303
its more like what they SAY about karate
8303
that you learn it so you dont use it
8303
but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time
8303
like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can
8303
its a god damn no brainer...
8303
thats what...
8303
you do...
8303
with...
8303
karate. john what the fuck are you doing here
8304
john dont get me wrong its cool that you randomly dropped by again but this wasnt really the best time
8304
we were kind of in the middle of a thing here
8304
dude are you time traveling
8304
please dont tell me youre time traveling
8304
you need to leave that shit to the experts
8304
who do you think youre talking to here
8304
do you see this bright red gear on my hoodie
8304
that means i know stuff about time travel
8304
sure looks like youre time traveling to me
8304
troll pirates
8304
john youre fucking shit up here
8304
you being here
8304
thats not supposed to happen
8304
all this shit were saying now
8304
its not supposed to go down like this i can feel it
8304
i dont think it matters now dude the pooch is already screwed
8304
wow wait that was a terrible figure of speech in this context but you know what i mean
8304
yo like i was JUST saying i didnt want to time travel anymore to avoid bullshit like this
8304
then what is it
8304
thats time travel genius
8304
alright
8304
but if it turns out you just created a doomed timeline and were all going to die im gonna be hella mad
8304
huh
8304
thats pretty dope if true
8304
actually in a way that almost makes me more nervous
8304
yeah messing with the alpha timeline
8304
i mean not the alpha timeline but the ALPHA alpha timeline
8304
almost seems
8304
heretical i guess?
8304
you sure you know what youre doing egbert
8304
gotcha
8304
welp im sold
8304
but uh
8304
really man you kind of are interrupting a thing
8304
temporal mechanics not even withstanding
8304
i think this was going to be a serious conversation here
8304
i have a feeling jade and i were going to get all heavy with our relationship issues or whatever
8304
uh
8304
does anyone even know whats going on NOW?
8304
truth
8304
what??
8304
holy shit so uncool
8304
