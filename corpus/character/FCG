GROAN.
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.
WHAT WAS I EVEN THINKING.
YEAH PRETTY MUCH.
NO YOU WON'T.
THIS ONE WAS PARTICULARLY NAUSEATING IN RETROSPECT, I'M SHUTTING THIS DOWN.
FINE THEN.
SINCE PAST ME JUST BANNED CURRENT ME FROM THE PRECEDING MEMO
AND DOESN'T APPEAR TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY FUTURE WISDOM, AS USUAL
LOOKS LIKE I'LL JUST HAVE TO START ANOTHER MEMO FROM SCRATCH.
HEY PAST ME, GO HAVE A BLAST KILLING THE KING, I'M SURE IT WILL BE AWESOME.
IN FACT, IT WAS AWESOME. BANG UP JOB WITH THAT, DUDE!
TOO BAD IT WAS ALL A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.
OH, WHAT'S THAT, PASTHOLE? YOU DIDN'T READ THIS AND FIGURE THAT OUT AHEAD OF TIME?
OR MAYBE YOU JUST SKIMMED THIS AND IT DIDN'T GET THROUGH YOUR THICK BULGE???
WHAT A SHOCK!
MEMO-WITHIN-MEMO TO PRESENT SELF: PUT FORTH A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT TO IMPRESS UPON EVERYONE IN THE PAST, MYSELF INCLUDED, WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS THEY ALL ARE.
I AM LEARNING A VALUABLE LESSON TODAY!
IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T ALTER THE OUTCOME OF DECISIONS MADE BY MORONS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU YELL AT THEM.
ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS GIVE THEM A HARD TIME AND TRY TO MAKE THEIR LIVES JUST A LITTLE MORE MISERABLE.
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MORE NOBLE PURSUIT THAN CHANGING DESTINY FOR THE BETTER ANYWAY, FRANKLY.
LOSERS SHOULD BE FORCED TO FACE THE MUSIC, EVEN FOR THE MISTAKES THEY HAVEN'T MADE YET.
THEIR PUNISHMENT IS BEING ALLOWED TO MAKE THE MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. TALK ABOUT POETIC JUSTICE!
AND THEN GETTING SOUNDLY BERATED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE MISTAKES ARE BEING MADE IS JUST THE MUCUS ON THE GRUBLOAF.
THE SWEET, TANGY MUCUS.
THIS IS DUMB.
WHY DID I EVER THINK THESE MEMOS WERE GOING TO BE A GOOD IDEA.
NOBODY CARES
I MEAN
NOBODY'S EVEN TROLLING ME ANYMORE.
AND I'M LEAVING MYSELF WIDE OPEN TOO, SAYING SOME PRETTY DUMB THINGS HERE.
I GUESS MAYBE I WROTE TOO MANY.
AND FILLED TOO MANY OF THEM WITH LONG ARGUMENTS WITH MYSELF.
NO ONE'S GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL THIS, ALL THE VALUABLE INFORMATION IS JUST GETTING LOST IN THE YELLING.
YOU STUPID STUPID IDIOT.
OH FUCK YOU, WHY'D YOU EVEN START ANOTHER MEMO THEN??
I GUESS
THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO GET OFF MY CHEST, OK?
OH GOD, NOW I'M ARGUING WITH CURRENT ME.
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE I WAS DOING IT, THIS IS REALLY FUCKED UP.
I'VE GOT TO PULL IT TOGETHER.
THINK BACK TO WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE WRONG.
BUT THE THING IS
AS MUCH AS OUR PAST SELVES ARE A BUNCH OF STUBBORN UNLISTENING ASSHOLES
I CAN'T EVEN REALLY IDENTIFY ANY MISTAKES WE MADE.
IT WAS ALL PRETTY MUCH LIKE CLOCKWORK.
A 600 HOUR CAMPAIGN TO COMPLETE A GAME LIKE THIS IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME.
AND I HAVE ASKED ME.
IT TURNS OUT ME AGREES.
I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN OUR SESSION.
SOLLUX HAS THE SAME INTUITION ABOUT IT AS ME, HE THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING FII2HY ABOUT IT.
IT'S REALLY INSUFFERABLE THE WAY HER FISH PUNS HAVE RUBBED OFF ON HIM, IT KIND OF MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT.
ANYWAY
HE SAYS HE'S WORKING ON TRACING THE ORIGIN OF THIS DISASTER.
IF I FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
I WILL
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.
WASTE OF GOOD FRESH RAGE.
I'M A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THE OLD THINGS I'VE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT.
IT'S GOTTEN SO STALE.
IN A WEIRD WAY I'M SORT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOMETHING NEW TO BE PISSED OFF ABOUT.
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO LIVE FOR NOW ANYWAY.
SO I'M KEEPING MY PRONGS CROSSED.
IT WILL BE LIKE FUCKING 12TH PERIGEE'S EVE UP IN HERE.
LAST SWEEP'S EVE WAS PROBABLY THE LAST HAPPY MEMORY I HAVE IN FACT.
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO FOR THE LAST HOLIDAY?
ANYONE?
I REMEMBER MY LUSUS HAD BEEN GONE FOR DAYS AND I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED.
BUT THEN HE FINALLY RETURNED, TRIUMPHANT.
HE BROUGHT THE FRESH BEHEMOTH LEAVING INTO OUR HIVE, AND TOGETHER WE DECORATED IT.
AND
I DUNNO
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY, I'M GETTING A LUMP IN MY SQUAWK BLISTER.
I GUESS I'M DONE.
I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN NOW
ON THE STEEL FLOOR OF THIS FRIGID METEOR DRIFTING THROUGH THE BLACK UNCARING VOID OF OUR NULL SESSION.
NULL, KIND OF LIKE THIS MEMO I GUESS.
LATER.
WHOA, HEY
WHAT?
OH
THAT'S COOL.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE RESPONDED TO A MEMO THAT I CAN RECALL.
YOU TOOK IT RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE THIS THING.
PRETTY MUCH.
FOR A WHILE IT WAS FRUSTRATING.
WHEN I DISCOVERED THE FEATURE I KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH ALL MY FUTURE MEMOS, NOT REALLY READING ALL OF THEM CAREFULLY OR THOROUGHLY.
THEN I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN, AND THE WHOLE BOARD WAS GONE.
BECAUSE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO I DID.
AND THEN I KEPT MAKING MEMOS WITH ONLY FOGGY RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED.
WHILE ALL THESE OTHER CHUMPS FROM DIFFERENT TIMES KEPT GIVING ME SHIT.
INCLUDING MYSELF.
BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD, BECAUSE AS I EVENTUALLY BECAME MY OWN FUTURE SELVES, AND GOT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDES OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.
AND COULD DO MY PAST SELVES THE SERVICE OF INFORMING THEM HOW STUPID THEY WERE BEING.
I STOPPED BOTHERING TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW ANY OF THESE MEMOS WENT.
HONESTLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN A BLUR TO ME, JUST NON STOP YELLING AT MYSELF, HAGGLING WITH PAST AND FUTURE KNUCKLEHEADS, KILLING MONSTERS AND SOLVING PUZZLES, CYCLING THROUGH ALL THE GATES AND PLANETS LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES, ZIGZAGGING DOWN TO THE BATTLEFIELD, OUT TO THE VEIL, OVER TO PROSPIT, BACK TO DERSE, AND ON AND ON AND ON LIKE THAT UNTIL WE THOUGHT WE WON.
BUT WE DIDN'T WIN. WE LOST.
WE LOST AS HARD AS FAT GUYS FALL.
DID YOU READ THE MEMO JUST BEFORE THIS?
GIVE IT A READ, I'M DONE RANTING ABOUT ALL THAT FOR NOW.
BUT YEAH, THAT'S HOW TROLLIAN'S TIMELINE STUFF WORKS. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
OR NOT! SINCE APPARENTLY THIS IS YOUR ONLY MEMO REPLY. YOU WERE PRETTY SHREWD IN SIDESTEPPING THIS WHOLE CLUSTERFUCK.
THEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.
HELL YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAID OF TIME THAN THE ONE WE WERE STUCK WITH.
SHE'S COMPLETELY SHITHIVE MAGGOTS, DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.
SURE YOU DO.
OR, YOU WILL. TRUST ME YOU'LL DO FINE.
SO WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO RESPOND ANYWAY.
I MEAN ASIDE FROM BEING STRONGARMED BY CONVERSATIONAL PREDESTINATION.
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE.
DO YOU REMEMBER IF THIS MEMO WAS MUCH LONGER THAN THIS?
THEN MIGHT AS WELL SPIT IT OUT.
RED OR BLACK?
YOUR PROBLEM, DOES IT PERTAIN TO REDROM OR BLACKROM INTERESTS?
COME ON. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THESE MEMOS TO SIFT THROUGH THEIR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS, I AM A FUCKING VETERAN AT THIS SHIT BY NOW.
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T MIND, IT'LL BE A WELCOME REPRIEVE FROM SHOUTING AT MYSELF.
DIDN'T YOU AT LEAST GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT WHEN YOU SKIMMED IT?
YES I COMPLETELY AGREE.
IT'S GOOD YOU DIDN'T READ IT. WE CAN AVOID THE SORT OF VERBAL SLAPSTICK ROUTINES I'M SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF BY NOW.
I AM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE BEING ALL COY AND TELLING ME WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SAY BEFORE WE SAY IT, AND THEN WE WIND UP FUCKING SAYING IT ANYWAY.
AND THEN WE PROVE TO THE INVISIBLE RIDDLER THAT IS FATHER TIME BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS WE ALL ARE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD THAT GETS AFTER A WHILE?
SO REALLY, TELL ME.
I KNOW IT'S ON YOUR MIND, I GOT A SENSE FOR THESE THINGS.
R OR B???
HAHA, WELL ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE CASE?
STORY AS OLD AS TIME.
EVEN IN PLACES WHERE STRICTLY SPEAKING TIME DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL RECENTLY.
WHO'S THE TARGET OF THESE FLUSHED LEANINGS?
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S READING.
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE ELSE JOIN IN LATER?
SEE
NOBODY CARES ENOUGH TO BOTHER.
WELL I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
THEIR DISINTEREST IS MORE A REFLECTION ON ME THAN YOU.
SHE? WELL I GUESS THAT NARROWS IT DOWN SOMEWHAT.
IF I THINK BACK ON EVENTS KNOWING THIS I COULD PROBABLY PIECE IT TOGETHER...
ALRIGHT, DEAL.
WHAT
NO OF COURSE NOT.
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THAT MUCH.
I JUST KNOW THIS STUFF WILL DRIVE YOU SHITHIVE MAGGOTS IF YOU DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.
LIKE
NOT THAT I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE A SHIT BUT PERSONALLY I AM ALL TWISTED UP ABOUT BLACKROM STUFF ESPECIALLY.
HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I WAS CUT OUT TO HAVE A KISMESIS, I THINK MY STANDARDS ARE WAY TOO HIGH.
DID YOU KNOW THAT...
THIS FEELS SO INSANE TO ADMIT, BUT
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS ADVENTURE, AT TIMES I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO SUSPECT I WAS MY OWN KISMESIS.
HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT???
BUT OBVIOUSLY ITS NOT TRUE, I NEVER EVEN DID ANY LEGIT TIME TRAVELING WHERE I COULD MEET MYSELF, I JUST BICKERED WITH PAST AND FUTURE GHOSTS ON A CHAT CLIENT.
FITTING REALLY. EVERY CALIGINOUS ADVERSARY I'VE CONTEMPLATED HAS ELUDED ME LIKE A PHANTOM, EVEN MYSELF!
WHATEVER, I'M DONE WITH IT.
NO NO NO I'M NOT AIRING THAT SHIT OUT HERE.
MAYBE PRIVATELY.
IT'S PRIVATE.
LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT, WHAT WERE YOU ORIGINALLY GOING TO ASK ME.
UH...
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT'S KIND OF THE DUMBEST FUCKING QUESTION I'VE EVER HEARD.
YOU PUT WAY TOO MUCH STOCK IN THAT RATTY OLD GUIDE.
BUT ANYWAY NO, WE NEVER USED MAGIC.
I MEAN, LET ME TRY TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW RIDICULOUS THE WHOLE NOTION IS ANYWAY.
WE CAN ALCHEMIZE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING WITH THE RIGHT MATERIALS AND GRIST.
WE CAN, AND DID, MAKE SUPER POWERFUL WEAPONS AND ITEMS THAT CAN DO PRACTICALLY ANYTHING.
WHAT ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE COULD MAGIC OFFER? ALL THIS SHIT IS PRACTICALLY MAGIC ANYWAY.
BUT MORE LIKE
GOOFY SCIENCEY MAGIC. YOU KNOW?
BUT EVERYTHING HERE IS KIND OF MAGIC IN A WAY, ISN'T IT.
FORTUNE TELLING DREAM CLOUDS AND GOLDEN MOONS AND SHIT.
IF YOU LOOK AROUND
THERE'S MAGIC EVERYWHERE IN THIS BITCH.
IT'S ALL AROUND US.
MOTHER FUCKIN MIRACLES, RIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU NEED MAGIC FOR ANYWAY?
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
AND YOU WON'T NEED MAGIC, TRUST ME.
JUST BE PATIENT, THE ANSWER WILL COME TO YOU SOMEHOW.
YEAH, REALLY THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE DETAILS OF THE ADVENTURE GO.
WE WERE ALL PRETTY AWESOME AT THIS GAME.
REALLY AWESOME IN FACT.
UNTIL A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
WHEN IT TURNED OUT WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY ALL THAT AWESOME.
TURNS OUT WE WERE PRETTY FUCKING UNAWESOME ALL ALONG.
WELL
FOR STARTERS
HAVE YOU SCROLLED UP TO THE TOP OF THE TIMELINES YET?
CHECK THAT OUT
MAYBE READ A FEW RECENT MEMOS
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH.
JUST DEAL WITH GETTING THROUGH THE QUEST.
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU CATCH UP WITH ME ON THE TIMELINE.
WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT NOW.
OK I PROBABLY WON'T DO THAT, BUT ALRIGHT HA HA.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE ANYWAY?
YEAH.
YOU'RE MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR CHAINSAW.
WHILE TAVROS IS SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.
OH GOD.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK WHAT ARE YOU DOING???????
I'M GOING TO BE FUCKING SICK.
HEY DON'T TALK TO HER LIKE THAT YOU UNCOUTH PIECE OF SHIT.
THIS IS REFLECTING POORLY ON BOTH OF US, IT'S GODDAMNED EMBARRASSING.
OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS A CLEVER THING TO SAY. WHAT A DIPSHIT.
JADE, I'M SORRY ABOUT PAST ME'S RETARDED BEHAVIOR.
I'M NOT GOING TO DRAG OUT A HUGE APOLOGY OR ANYTHING BECAUSE I ALREADY APOLOGIZED IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION, OK. I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.
PLEASE, JUST
SHUT UP
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER THOUGHT FUTURE ME WAS THE STUPID ONE
PAST ME IS THE DUMBEST BUCKET OF FESTERING DISCHARGE I EVER FELL ASS BACKWARDS INTO.
COME ON, YOU KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. REMEMBER ALL THE PAST USSES WE USED TO TALK TO??
THEY WERE EVEN PASTER THAN YOU, AND THEREFORE DUMBER.
LOOK, JADE'S NOT THAT BAD OK.
YOU JUST GOT TOO WORKED UP, AND YOU CAN'T SEE THAT.
AND NOW ALL THIS FROTHING PANDEMONIUM JUMPING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS JUST RIDICULOUS OVERCOMPENSATION FOR YOUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND MISTAKES, AND MASKING SOME FEELINGS YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN TOUCH WITH.
THIS IS ALL SO OBVIOUS, I'M FLUSHING LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER IN EMBARRASSMENT HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, AND EVEN WORSE, REMEMBERING HAVING IT EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE SMART ONE THREE HOURS AGO AND STILL ACTING LIKE A MOIST GLOBE EVEN AFTER BEING SO SOUNDLY SCHOOLFED.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF, WE DON'T JOKE AROUND. IT'S JUVENILE, REMEMBER.
I JUST SLAPPED MYSELF! I REMEMBERED MY LAME NOTE TO MYSELF FROM THREE HOURS AGO, AND THEN SLAPPED MYSELF SPECIFICALLY TO MOCK YOU.
IT STINGS TOO, YOU'LL FEEL IT IN A WHILE. AND THEN THE GHOST OF PAST ME WILL CRY.
PAST ME DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE. HE'S A STUPID BAWLING WIGGLER PHANTOM. HE'S DEAD, NOT A REAL GUY ANYMORE, LIKE ME.
I'M THE REAL ONE. YOU'RE FAKE, A SHADOW OF A SAD MEMORY THAT PISSED ITS PANTS WHILE SCREAMING.
TIME TO DEAL WITH IT.
YES!!!!!
LET THIS FUCKER KNOW THE SCORE JADE. THIS IS HOW WE ROLL.
YES, THAT WAS GREAT. WE BOTH HAD IT COMING, ESPECIALLY HIM. GREAT WORK JADE.
OH RIGHT, ABOUT THAT
YEAH WE NEED TO TALK
I MEAN WE HAVE ALREADY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY BUSY SOON, BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO ENTER YOUR SESSION
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU DO, THEN JUST HIT ME UP, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
LOOK I KNOW THINGS ARE WEIRD BETWEEN US RIGHT NOW AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE MAD.
ESPECIALLY AT THAT LOSER.
BUT THINGS WILL CHANGE, IN TIME YOU'LL SEE I'M NOT QUITE SO AWFUL, OK?
OH I SEE, NOW YOU COULD USE A KNIGHT, HOW VERY INTERESTING, HMMM.
GOD I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO BE FUTURE YOU, SLIGHTLY LESS FUTURE YOU IS SUCH A GOD DAMN PILL
HAHAHAHA, YOU HEAR THAT YOU OBSOLETE PILE OF GARBAGE? JADE JUST FLIPPED YOU OFF WITH A COLORFUL FINGER.
NO, I CAN BLAME YOU, YOU'RE THE ONE WITH NO MANNERS WHO'S ALL TWISTED UP INSIDE.
HOW'S THIS FOR A PACT, EVERYBODY.
PAST KARKAT ONLY TALKS TO PAST JADE FROM NOW ON, AND THE TWO OF THEM CAN BICKER LIKE SHITTY LITTLE CHILDREN FOR HOURS/YEARS RESPECTIVELY.
AND FUTURE KARKAT ONLY TALKS TO FUTURE JADE, AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREIN ONLY INTELLIGENT DISCOURSE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN TWO CIVILIZED, MATURE, GROWN ASSED ADULTS.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK??????
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST BAN HER ALREADY AND END THIS TORMENT SINCE YOU DRAGGED HER INTO THIS.
WILL YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH, MAN THE FUCK UP, AND BAN THIS POOR GIRL ALREADY?
OK, THERE. SHE'S GONE.
MAYBE NOW YOU GET IT.
HOW HIDEOUS EVERYONE THINKS YOU ARE, MAYBE YOU'LL FINALLY STOP FUCKING EVERYTHING UP.
WHAT
SHHHHSHHSHSHSHSH
SHE CAN STILL READ THIS YOU STUPID FUCK
NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO OPEN YOUR VEINS AND WRITE POEMS ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
I...
BUT
HOW COULD THAT EVEN BE A REAL THING I TYPED THREE HOURS AGO, HOW COULD I BE THIS STUPID.
WE ARE JUST THE DUMBEST FUCKERS WHO EVER LIVED AREN'T WE.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ENERGY TO BAN US.
I'M JUST LEAVING.
FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK.
I CAN'T
I JUST CANNOT
*FUCKING*
***BELIEVE***
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS BULLSHIT AGAIN WITH YOU/ME.
WHAT THE FUCK MADE ME THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA???
UUUUUGH.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME!
I JUST HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE PREMONITION YOU'RE ABOUT TO ANYWAY.
SURE IS!
?????? <- SARCASTIC WONDER.
WELL HEY, CHECK IT OUT: SHIT JUST GOT NOSTALGIC.
LOOK AT THAT, I'M FEELING MORE SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS MORONIC CONVERSATION ALREADY.
THE BLINK OF A GLANCE NUGGET?? I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR TEN MINUTES ALREADY. AND COUNTING!
(I WANT TO KILL MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T UNTIL THE CONVERSATION RUNS ITS COURSE. THIS IS THE WORST HELL IMAGINABLE.)
OH! I GET IT NOW.
WHEN I TYPE IN RED, IT'S SHOWY AND INSECURE, BUT WHEN YOU DO IT, YOU ARE SHOULDERING THE PRAGMATIC BURDEN OF A MARTYR, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS *MY* FUCKING IDEA TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE TEN MINUTES AGO!
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR STUPID FEELINGS ALREADY SO WE CAN GET THIS NIGHTMARE OVER WITH.
OK WHATEVER. JUST SAY SOME STUFF ALREADY. ALL THAT SHIT I SAID TEN MINUTES AGO.
I WILL "RIFF" WITH YOU AND SOMEHOW PRETEND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I'M REHASHING A BUNCH OF LINES WRITTEN IN BARELY DRIED INK!!!
YEAH.
"I HEAR YOU MAN."
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT.
BUT FOR THE RECORD, I GUESS I MEANT IT.
I KNOW WHY.
YEAH.
WELL THERE'S THAT
BUT ALSO THIS CONVERSATION HELPED CLARIFY SOME THOUGHTS TOO, IN SPITE OF ITS EXCRUCIATING POINTLESSNESS.
PART OF WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT MORTALITY.
HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR, BRO.
PRETTY MUCH.
WELL.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING TEN MINUTES AGO.
BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
SDJS;ALSKJFSA;JK
THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
NO YOU SURE AS FUCK DO NOT.
FUCK, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING LISTENING TO THIS, MAKE IT STOP.
WE JUST WENT OVER THIS.
I DIDN'T GET IT THEN BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY WHINING AND FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF LIKE YOU'RE DOING NOW SO PIPE DOWN AND LISTEN.
YOU'VE BEEN SENDING HER AN ENDLESS STREAM OF MIXED SIGNALS FOR AS LONG AS YOU'VE KNOWN HER.
LIKE FUCK IT'S BULLSHIT.
IT'S ALL TOO CLEAR TO ME NOW. IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF QUADRANT VACILLATION, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
NO WONDER SHE WAS FRUSTRATED AND GOT FED UP WITH YOU.
IS IT?? TELL ME, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TREATED HER IN A WAY THAT COULD BE OBJECTIVELY CONSTRUED AS A FORM OF BLACK SOLICITATION?
YEAH, A *HEALTHY* ONE, NOT ONE INVOLVING A DEMENTED LOUDMOUTH WHO CAN'T KEEP HIS SHIT UNDER CONTROL.
LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MUCH OF THAT ANIMOSITY IS INNOCENT "PLATONIC RAGE"?
COULD IT BE THAT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU WANT TO PUSH THINGS WITH HER ONTO CALIGINOUS TURF, MAYBE SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT THERE?
SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR GRUB, AND CULL IT TOO??
THAT WAY YOU HAVE HER ALL TO YOURSELF!
YOU WANT HER IN EVERY QUADRANT LIKE A DESPERATE FOOL.
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE BECOME? YOU ARE THE SAD JOKE CHARACTER IN THE ROMCOM, YOU KNOW THE GUY I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WHO'S GREEDY AND INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT FILLING EVERY QUADRANT, TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO IT, AND IN THE END HAS FUCKALL TO SHOW FOR IT.
YOU KIND OF DO, FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES.
YEAH, YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE, BECAUSE THE TEN MINUTES ARE ABOUT UP, AND I'LL BE GONE.
THEN IT'LL JUST BE YOU AND THE OTHER GUY, SPINNING YOUR GLOBES TOGETHER LIKE A COUPLE STUPID PIECES OF SHIT, AD INFINITUM.
I CAN'T EVEN DO THIS, NOT ANY MORE.
HMM.
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME
THIS DUMB TANTRUM I THREW
THIS ENTIRE BAD MOOD...
IT WAS JUST ANOTHER IDIOTIC SELF-FULFILLING REACHAROUND WASN'T IT.
I MEAN, WHERE DID THIS EVEN COME FROM?
IT WAS LIKE SPONTANEOUSLY GENERATING SELF-LOATHING WITH NO DISCERNIBLE SOURCE.
WAS THIS EMOTIONAL OUTBURST EVER EVEN REAL?
ARE YOU SURE, MAN?
YEAH, SEE
I'VE COMPLETELY SET YOU OFF HERE, AND NOW YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
SORRY, THIS WAS MY FAULT. I'M GOING TO GO TRY AND CALM MYSELF DOWN.
