6044
good morning, lovely. ^u^
6044
so i gUess today is finally the day yoU make everything better.
6044
it is the day whereafter the legendary octet of mUtUal progenitoriety will come together and heal a great breach in paradox space.
6044
a day delivered throUgh eighty billion years and foUr distinct Universal instances worth of Unfathomable tUrbUlence.
6044
and while the emerald eye of this storm is fixed in the abyss forever
6044
today yoU are poised to escape its scowl once and for all.
6044
by skaias gUiding light, yoU may leave behind its tUrning arms of bright coloUrs and mayhem, and secUre peace for yoUr cosmic progeny for all dUration.
6044
and if yoU are to meet this departUre with trepidation i woUld Understand! bUt also i woUld ask
6044
is there nothing i can do to ease yoUr mind?
6044
yes. u_u;
6044
i'm afraid i am gUilty of rehearsing this pep talk well in advance.
6044
i thoUght yoU deserved a proper sendoff.
6044
well then?
6044
is there nothing i can do?
6044
it was a serioUs qUestion. :u
6044
splendid! ^u^
6044
bUt remember i will be here to help, whilst refraining from caUsal spoilers to the best of my ability.
6044
have yoU corresponded with yoUr first designated co-player yet?
6044
not the today that is local to yoU.
6044
thoUgh i do have a wee bit more troUble monitoring her than the rest of yoU. cUrioUs dark patches in transmission, hUmph.
6044
still, i woUldn't fret over it. she is as good a chUm as any yoU have and shoUld come throUgh Ultimately, even if things seem dire.
6044
blimey! :U
6044
indeed, im sUre it was. i knew yoU woUld wake Up soon!
6044
might yoU describe what yoU saw?
6044
not at all! that is a simple detail aboUt the realm yoU are aboUt to explore, withoUt directly involving yoUr fUtUre decisions of conseqUence.
6044
the place yoU visited was called prospit. it is where i have woken Up every time i have gone to sleep for most of my life.
6044
no, yoU woUldnt have.
6044
my prospit is an alternate version from yoUrs, in a completely different session qUite far afield of yoUr reality.
6044
if we are ever to meet in person, it is Unlikely to be while playing oUr respective games!
6044
i think this is for yoU to determine in time. what is yoUr hUnch?
6044
Understandable. bUt it will be important to practice patience today.
6044
yoU have a long road ahead of yoU, and many qUestions will be answered in time.
6044
bUt we can talk it over later. now, we both have games to prepare for!
6044
i know yoU coUld never fUlly appreciate what this actUally meant, bUt i took mUch care to sync Up these conversations with yoU on the same day that i begin playing as well.
6044
that way, we can joUrney throUgh oUr sessions together and compare notes! :u
6044
~_u
6044
will yoU :U!!!
6044
oh, hee hee! bUt i never claimed to be from that planet, which is only in the far reaches of yoUr solar system.
6044
in fact i am from mUch farther away. a different Universe altogether.
6044
bUt if yoU trUly mean it, thank yoU for believing me!
6044
now, jane my lovely, let Us prepare for this adventUre.
6044
remember what i said aboUt the need for patience.
6044
patience with yoUr friends.
6044
patience for yoUr growth as a hero of life.
6044
and patience for the coming of the other foUr of legend.
6044
a hero of breath and of light and of time and of space!
6044
and if yoU still find yoUrself in doUbt
6044
jUst check the inscription on that big old book downstairs.
6044
after all, if yoU cant trUst words written by yoUr own hand
6044
then what Use is trUst at all? ^u^
6044
<kisses!>
6081
hello there, darling. ~3u
6081
i dont relish troUbling yoU with more arm twisting.
6081
im sUre for all ive done so far yoUve had a jolly good workoUt already :u
6081
bUt yoU will be ready to deliver the package today, yes?
6081
:U
6081
how so???
6081
well there yoU go, love! better hop to it.
6081
i did indeed say so!
6081
and have already done.
6081
in yoUr fUtUre.
6081
i relayed the information enabling yoU to create the powerfUl weaponry yoUrself.
6081
and yoU did!
6081
yoU then sent them back in time. yoU may recover them in the rUins, which conveniently is where yoU mUst go to ship the package once and for all.
6081
bangUp plan we hatched, dont yoU fancy? ^u^
6081
that is somewhat close to the trUth, and i can see how yoU woUld draw that conclUsion.
6081
bUt theres more to it yoU dont Understand yet! yoU will sort it all oUt in time.
6081
somewhat.
6081
it woUldnt hUrt yoU mUch to know the trUth, i imagine.
6081
its jUst the trUth is a wee bit complicated.
6081
perhaps a draft of the cascading seqUence from which yoUr reality has arisen will pUt yoUr mind at ease.
6081
imagine two Universes, A and B.
6081
now imagine there are two instances of each Universe, A1 and A2 and B1 and B2.
6081
the first instance of each is like a test rUn, that does not qUite sUcceed.
6081
the second instance thoUgh will meet all of its pUrposes!
6081
now consider that A1 begets A2.
6081
A2 begets B1.
6081
and B1 begets B2.
6081
and the participants of B2 are the ones who will make an effort to exit all this tUrbUlence and falderal.
6081
yoU are one of them! :U
6081
and yoUr yoUng ancestor is another, thoUgh she is "presently" stationed in B1.
6081
and yes she is in the past.
6081
thoUgh not qUite as far as yoU believe!
6081
nor does she occUpy the same stream of continUity.
6081
thats the best i can do for now. u_u
6081
primarily becaUse i will not risk wasting mUch more of yoUr time!
6081
oh yes! ^u^
6081
caUsal spoilers, sir english!
6081
given the natUre of the qUest waiting for yoU, it woUldnt be shrewd of me to rUle oUt the employment of time travel by any individUal.
6081
bUt i will say that yoUre probably prey to a basic misapprehension aboUt the natUre of this rendezvoUs.
6081
it will not take place on earth.
6081
it will happen inside the game yoUre aboUt to play!
6081
indeed. :u
6081
so trUe. id pay a hefty ransom to get to know my forebears.
6081
correct. i never knew those who one woUld identify as my parental eqUivalents. U_U
6081
it is in the way my race propagates. oUr ancestors precede Us by millenia.
6081
nope! never did.
6081
^u^
6081
hm trUthfUlly?
6081
it may be for the best that yoU never know it.
6081
it coUld stir Up some things best left in their present eqUilibriUm.
6081
and now i think i shoUld bollocks off and leave yoU to it!
6081
no more procrastinating!
6081
contact yoUr friend, darling.
6081
i think yoU will have more fUn than yoU can imagine finding oUt.
6081
bUt stated concisely, and short of spoilerly as yoU so charmingly pUt it,
6081
yoUr objective today is to pave the way for the arrival of gods.
6081
<kisses!>
6413
there yoU are!
6413
tricky one to track down, yoU are. :u
6413
oh no doUbt!
6413
methinks it has less to do with yoUr actUal whereaboUts as it does with yoUr virtUes as a hero of void.
6413
caUsal! and yes, somewhat. however...
6413
with these spoilers, by their natUre, the more time that passes for yoU the less relevant it becomes to gUard their secrecy.
6413
as yoU approach yoUr entry, details i have obscUred will become more plainly evident.
6413
so i see no harm in loosening my tongUe on certain matters the closer yoU get to the appointed hoUr! ^u^
6413
yes.
6413
the void aspect is fascinating, thoUgh.
6413
its heroes preside over the essence of lack, or nothingness. the obfUscation of knowledge, or its oUtright destrUction.
6413
well, *i* think it is wonderfUl. u_u
6413
and anyway, one can hardly draw many conclUsions aboUt a player by aspect alone.
6413
the aspect is channeled more specifically by the assets of ones class.
6413
pretty mUch! :U
6413
hmmmmm?
6413
i Understand what yoU're getting at, yes.
6413
it is certainly possible that we may have common groUnd with oUr ancestors when it comes to oUr aspects, and the way oUr abilities reveal themselves to Us. i coUld not rUle this oUt.
6413
bUt there is always more to examine.
6413
for instance, a hero of life and a hero of doom have aspects as different as can be.
6413
bUt if their classes are different enoUgh as well, that is, one active and the other passive, remarkably there is a chance they coUld end Up with very similar abilities!
6413
player abilities may also manifest in ways in defiance with their aspects if they are heavily resistant to their trUe calling. or, if corrUpted in some way by an oUtside inflUence.
6413
bUt it is rather clear to me yoU are one who embraces her aspect qUite heartily, even if yoU are not aware of it. ^u^
6413
oh yes, everyone is having important dreams as we near oUr mUtUal entries. this is lovely!
6413
please tell.
6413
can yoU describe her?
6413
she soUnds to me like the well known figUre of legend.
6413
or at least, well known to those who make the stUdy of sUch matters into their all consUming pastime. ~_u
6413
i believe yoU saw the seer of light.
6413
it woUld normally be my instinct to sUpply a vagUe response here...
6413
bUt i think that yoUr heart has already told yoU the answer, and as sUch my secrecy woUld be pUrposeless.
6413
so, yes, that she was!
6413
fella?
6413
what do yoU mean?
6413
oh...
6413
yes!
6413
pardon my slUggishness on the Uptake. we are very different species, reprodUctively and familially, remember?
6413
that i think is something i cannot say, or that is, shoUld not say.
6413
oh, please don't press me for information! it makes me feel terribly gUilty.
6413
yoU've no idea how mUch i woUld fancy revealing everything, and exchange oUr stories endlessly. bUt i mUst show restraint.
6413
Ummm.
6413
u_u;
6413
i am not embarrassed, i jUst don't know what yoU're talking aboUt!
6413
Um...
6413
maybe?
6413
Um...
6413
maybe! :u
6413
i confirmed no sUch thing, roxy!
6413
yoU are being frightfUlly difficUlt! yoU jUst keep pUshing and pUshing and i can maintain my composUre for only so long!
6413
if yoU are really cUrioUs aboUt the events sUrroUnding yoUr daUghter's origin, yoU can always ask her in person when yoU meet her.
6413
oh...
6413
well, yes.
6413
bUt i'm not sUre if i shoUld have revealed that jUst now! yoU see what happens when yoU pUsh me!!!
6413
there is so mUch for me to keep track of, and it gets very difficUlt to remember what information to reveal at what time when yoU are flUstered.
6413
yes, basically.
6413
yes.
6413
the game provides a mechanism for the revival of the deceased, yes. it is called a kernelsprite, and yoU are free to gather remains of any dead party yoU choose, to revive that individUal in the form of a sprite. the sprite will then serve as a helpfUl spirit gUide on yoUr joUrney!
6413
i believe i was very forthright in my answer!
6413
if yoU play the game, yoU will meet yoUr daUghter.
6413
if yoU play the game, yoU will meet yoUr mother too!
6413
simple as can be. ^u^
6413
-u-
6413
...
6413
u~u
6413
those are...
6413
definitely some things which yoU believe coUld be trUe or not trUe! :u
6413
i am not any kind of liar!
6413
U!
6413
i choose U!!! :U!!!!!
6413
i do love U's!
6413
bUt i really don't lie!
6413
i am not deceitfUl by natUre bUt in order to protect the integrity of certain oUtcomes while still being helpfUl to yoU, i gUess i am learning the art of deception throUgh honesty?
6413
which as it tUrns oUt, as well intended as it may be, still comes across to a savvy lass like yoUrself as jUst another kind of eqUivocation.
6413
thoUgh i gUess i shoUldn't be so startled that a rogUe of void coUld bewilder me so.
6413
void players are said in texts to have a way with flUmmoxing even those with plans beyond mortal Understanding.
6413
and i'm far from anyone like that. jUst a girl who wants to help!
6414
i'd be ever so gratefUl. :u
6414
yes! i can tell yoU plenty aboUt that.
6414
a rogUe is a passive class. yoU see, there are passive (+) and active (-) classes. some more strongly passive or active than others.
6414
the +/- distinction can mean many things, bUt coUld be qUite roUghly sUmmed Up in this way: active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves, while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others.
6414
bUt of coUrse there's plenty more to it, and that rUle is in no way absolUte. only a starting point for Understanding the dichotomy.
6414
sUre!
6414
that's another fine way of looking at it.
6414
classes always come in +/- pairs, with significant disparity between them.
6414
while a rogUe is passive, a thief woUld be its far more active coUnterpart.
6414
the rogUe and thief classes tend to be assigned to females. not exclUsively, bUt commonly!
6414
other classes lean more toward male assignment, while others are exclUsively male, and jUst as many are exclUsively female. like my class. ^u^
6414
that's a bit of a tangent thoUgh. to answer yoUr qUestion aboUt being a rogUe, i shoUld tell yoU both classes in +/- pairs tend to have very similar descriptions.
6414
in this case, a rogUe or a thief is "one who steals." qUite simple, really!
6414
bUt whether the class is + or - makes all the difference. it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make Use of the aspect.
6414
if that reference to yoUr cUltUre provides a sUitable comparison, then absolUtely. :U
6414
Understandable.
6414
yes, it is one of the more conceptUally nebUloUs pairings, i agree.
6414
and i can't say i know a smashing good deal aboUt the natUre of the void player's path, since the aspect is by definition inscrUtable to those it does not choose.
6414
bUt i can at least tell yoU this.
6414
if yoU are ever to enjoy fUll ascension as a rogUe of void, yoU will be able to do some completely astonishing things!
6414
oh no, yoU will not pry this oUt of me.
6414
not to preserve caUsality, bUt to keep the sUrprise in store for yoU.
6414
it woUld not be honoUrable of me to spoil the discovery, shoUld yoU be fortUnate enoUgh to realize yoUr potential.
6414
is that so?
6414
woUld yoU mind listing them?
6414
all fine points.
6414
is there nothing i can do to make the decision easier?
6414
what's a waffle arsed chUmp?
6414
is it earth cUisine? :u~
6414
that's another statement that doesn't make a good deal of sense to me, bUt if it is important to yoU, then godspeed!
6414
i'm so pleased to hear yoU are leaning in favor of participating with the rest of Us. i promise we'll all have a ball together.
6414
now i have a bUsy schedUle to keep Up with so i mUst go. bUt please remember yoU can always contact me if yoU have qUestions.
6414
don't be a stranger, love. ta! ^u^
6464
i see yoU're aboUt ready to begin. how splendid for yoU. ^u^
6464
i'm at dangeroUs risk of jealoUsy.
6464
oh, it's jUst i'm rUnning a bit behind schedUle. i wanted to coordinate with yoUr groUp in something approximating real time, and that is starting to look less likely.
6464
my client player continUes to be a soUrce of frUstration. u_u
6464
i'd thoUght we had everything settled, bUt it's always something with him.
6464
i even told him in my last message it woUld sUit me fine if he wanted to be the server player instead. i jUst want to begin!
6464
bUt i have not heard back from him... >:u
6464
bUt at least i know how certain things go when it comes to yoUr story.
6464
i don't qUite have that lUxUry with mine! it is nerve wracking sometimes, especially when i mUst coUnt on him to be responsible.
6464
this is trUe.
6464
thoUgh i'm sUre i've said, he isn't qUite my brother. we are related, yes, bUt not in the way hUman brothers and sisters are.
6464
we are genetically similar, bUt in many ways qUite different. in fact, oUr blood coloUr is not even the same!
6464
bUt i have referred to him as a brother at times becaUse it is close enoUgh to being trUe, mUch as yoU refer to the one yoU regard as yoUr ancestor in the same way.
6464
no, i think yoU're probably right.
6464
while i await his response, perhaps i will take a nap, and see if the cloUds may offer any gUidance.
6464
thoUgh lately i have been seeing many more black cloUds cropping Up in skaia than UsUal. it is a most Unwelcome trend. u_u;
6464
good point! :U
6464
i am so pleased to be a prospit dreamer. i'm sUre my brother finds his netherworldly affiliation similarly pleasing.
6464
is that so?
6464
yes, that is a pickle.
6464
i don't know aboUt precedent, bUt it makes plenty of sense to me as the type of path one might expect for a hero of heart.
6464
a path rUled by the heart aspect can be a joUrney of splintered self.
6464
that is, the player's being may exhibit the same kind of fragmentation which certain classes coUld caUse in others.
6464
i think this is what has triggered yoUr dUal-awareness between waking and dream selves, thoUgh it woUld not sUrprise me if the symptoms manifested in even more ways than this.
6464
no!
6464
like i said, these can be traits of sUch a hero, bUt is not necessarily always the case, nor is it the defining property of the aspect.
6464
to Understand the heart aspect better, yoU might Use it interchangeably with the word soUl.
6464
the hero Uses the methods endowed by class to inflUence in some way the soUl, or essence of being, of oneself or of others.
6464
yes.
6464
no!
6464
again, sUrface meaning of classes and aspects can be deceptive.
6464
a prince is a destroyer class.
6464
it is very far on the active side of the scale. its more passive coUnterpart woUld be the bard class. both of these are exclUsively designated for male players.
6464
to Understand a hero's capabilities, it always helps to search for the right way to parse the class/aspect pair into a more explicit statement.
6464
for instance, being active, a prince coUld be viewed as "one who destroys x, or caUses destrUction throUgh x," if x is the aspect.
6464
while the more passive bard coUld be seen as "one who allows x to be destroyed, or invites destrUction throUgh x," as if by the will of the aspect.
6464
maybe! it's a qUirky class.
6464
somewhat like a wildcard role for a hero. very Unpredictable.
6464
they are typically known for their spontaneoUs and dramatic story-altering inflUence on the fate of a party.
6464
some of the more remarkable tales involve sUch parties, where the bard is single handedly responsible for their spectacUlar downfall or improbable victory. or both!
6464
in trUth, yoU are probably fortUnate yoUr groUp doesn't have one. :u
6464
indeed.
6464
i woUldn't be hasty in rUling it oUt.
6464
that is, finding the need to Use the ability, not sUccUmbing to any sort of villainy. u~u
6464
we tend to have these roles for a reason, and that reason UsUally finds Us. especially if we are to achieve god tier ascension.
6464
no dirk!
6464
i mean, no, i will not tell yoU!!!
6464
that very well may be, bUt it will dreadfUlly complicate both of oUr lives if what is to come resUlts from self-fUlfillment alone!
6464
a great deal of instrUctional material is very clear on this.
6464
besides, yoU make it soUnd as thoUgh i know everything, which i most certainly do NOT. upu
6464
(pardon the sideways tongUe.)
6464
i have read mUch aboUt yoUr story in texts and have pieced together the overarching, exceedingly complicated saga as best as i coUld. i have as mUch aUthority over these events as a historian, and am at the mercy of my soUrces.
6464
i also am able to access mUch of yoUr adventUre throUgh this terminal, bUt there is a limitation to this too, which i may as well admit now to get yoU off of my back!
6464
i can view all events involving yoU and yoUr coplayers on earth, for yoUr entire lives, Until yoU enter the game.
6464
i can also view some events after yoUr session begins, bUt not for very long, thanks to yoUr tipsy friend.
6464
she blacks oUt yoUr entire session!
6464
i'm sUre this is not deliberate on her part, bUt thereafter i can see nothing at all.
6464
bUt i have never considered this to the detriment of either party. i still wish for Us to collaborate, and to help each other oUt.
6464
beyond a certain point, we simply mUst commUnicate in the dark.
6464
so there are many things aboUt yoUr fUtUre i do not know, at least not first hand.
6464
bUt as yoU have probably ventUred, i am qUite an enthUsiastic admirer of yoUr groUp of heroes and yoUr incredible story. ^u^
6464
thoUgh i can't see what happens mUch later, i can certainly specUlate. and i very often do. i gUess it woUld not hUrt to share some of my specUlation with yoU.
6464
in fact, now that i consider it, that coUld be the most fUn thing of all!
6464
yes. theories! examining all the clUes and hazarding oUr gUesses.
6464
what does it all mean? everything aboUt yoUr vast epic points to a central mystery which i have not been able to solve yet.
6464
yoU might even call it the Ultimate riddle, if that were not already codified as "a thing" in scriptUre.
6464
i have so very many theories, i woUldn't even know where to begin.
6464
i woUldn't go that far! oh my, i'm probably coming off as an absolUte nUtter now.
6464
hm? :u
6464
UUUUUUm...
6464
.....
6464
yes. u_u
6465
ohhhh, no no no no no no no.
6465
i woUld be far too embarrassed to do that.
6465
well...
6465
maybe jUst...
6465
Um.
6465
a wee bit. :u
6465
a smidgen or two.
6465
OK A WHOLE BLOODY LOT OF SMIDGENS. XU
6465
i'm sorry. unu
6465
bUUUt...
6465
yoU woUldn't even Understand it!
6465
my species has a completely different Understanding of romance than yoU do.
6465
it woUld probably offend yoU deeply. it might even sicken yoU!
6465
no, i'm sorry love, i jUst CANNOT abide.
6465
if i let anyone read it, i woUld cUrl Up and die of shame. U_U
6465
hmm.
6465
well, when i find myself immersed in specUlation...
6465
i do often enjoy drawing the things i imagine.
6465
yes. ^u^
6465
well...
6465
yes!
6465
yoU've talked me into it. this sUddenly soUnds fUn, and i have jUst the thing to show yoU.
6465
yoU were asking aboUt whether yoU woUld ascend to godhood.
6465
and withoUt getting into whether yoU do or do not, i have specUlated on yoUr hypothetical appearance, since that oUtcome is jUst as cloaked to me as it is to yoU.
6465
given what is docUmented for the typical accoUtrements and cUt of the prince garb, and palette for the heart aspect, i think this is likely spot on!
6465
http://tinyurl.com/dirkisthisyoU
6465
perhaps. it all depends Upon how mUch of yoUr inner greatness yoU wish to realize. u_u
6465
we sproUt them Upon ascension! aren't they beaUtifUl?
6465
i have seen many depictions of sUch heroes with wings, Unless they happen to be hiding them beneath their clothes.
6465
i gUess i can't be absolUtely sUre, bUt i believe it's reasonably likely the Upgrade is Universal!
6465
yUp!
6465
one hUndred percent princely canon.
6465
no, silly.
6465
they are jUst clothes. yoU are free to swap parts if yoU like.
6465
or, if yoU wish to be free of it altogether, change back into yoUr plain clothes, and bob's yoUr Uncle. like it never even happened!
6465
^u^!!!
6465
oh...
6465
no, love! it was a figUre of speech.
6465
ah.
6465
did i Use it incorrectly?
6465
say, what is an Uncle, by the by?
6465
hmm.
6465
i sUppose i'll jUst have to take yoUr word for it. :u
6465
yes?
6465
doing what now?
6465
hmm...
6465
no, i fancy neither of those things make mUch sense at all.
6465
oh!
6465
yes, that woUld be my qUirk.
6465
no! a qUirk!!!
6465
qUirk dirk.
6465
heeheehee. ^u^
6465
we all need a qUirk!
6465
it adds spice to oUr voices and helps Us stand oUt as individUals.
6465
oh, well of coUrse YOU woUldn't.
6465
yoU're hUman.
6465
hUmans are notorioUsly strange. :U
6466
i think their romantic practices are particUlarly esoteric.
6466
actUally, i have written hUndreds of pages examining the striking differences between hUman and troll romance, as well as reprodUctive habits, as the comparison makes for a marveloUs case stUdy in xenobiocUltUral differences.
6466
as long as i am sharing specUlation with yoU, perhaps yoU woUld like to read my essays?
6466
i coUld even paste each page right here in sUccession, and allow yoU to read them back to back to back to back to back to back! ^u^
6466
ah.
6466
yes, yoU're right of coUrse. i'm probably getting carried away as UsUal.
6466
forgive my enthUsiasm, it's jUst that i so rarely have anyone to talk to who shares my passion for these matters.
6466
certainly not my cUrmUdgeonly coplayer. >:U
6466
by jove, the nap!!!
6466
yes, i really mUst secUre a bit of shUteye.
6466
yoUr lord?
6466
what...
6466
do yoU mean by that exactly? :u
6466
oh, right!
6466
i woUld look at it this way.
6466
yoU are moments away from beginning yoUr session, yes?
6466
and yoU have already spent a long time gathering intelligence Unbeknownst to the aUthorities.
6466
how mUch more do yoU expect to accUmUlate even if yoU coUld stay Undetected?
6466
and how mUch strategic advantage is left to gain by delaying yoUr discovery for mUch longer?
6466
i say the time to make a stand is now!
6466
to hell with the dersite tossers.
6466
make yoUr presence known. let them see that the prince is awake, and make it abUndantly clear what that means.
6466
perhaps it is their tUrn to be nervoUs? to cower in the shadows and live in Uncertainty?
6466
that is my advice. do with it as yoU will.
6466
now i'm off to get some rest. u_u
6466
with any lUck, the next time we convene, both of oUr adventUres will be well Under way.
6466
cheerio!
6721
hUzzah! yoU did it! ^u^
6721
made it to locah! yoUr own personal planet inside the game, tailored to yoUr personal qUest.
6721
i've observed yoU here before, of coUrse. bUt this is the first time i've contacted yoU here.
6721
better to keep things on the Up and Up vis a vis oUr mUtUal linearity, no?
6721
sUre? :u
6721
i Understand.
6721
pardon my grUmpy demeanoUr. i jUst had a nap and did not sleep well.
6721
wasn't i being? :u
6721
well good! i do my best.
6721
really, as if my dreadfUl nap were not bad enoUgh, i woke Up to find my coplayer has made a terrible mess in here.
6721
bUt the good news is he has at least agreed to play with me once and for all. some people make nothing easy.
6721
Um.
6721
i haven't!
6721
not in person.
6721
oh, yes, well, hmm.
6721
the thing with that is this.
6721
the thing with that is that we shoUld talk aboUt something else!
6721
why mUst yoU be sUch the vigilant gUmshoe, jane?
6721
always with the gUmshooery. pitch that pUzzlesavvy toward the conUndra littered aboUt yoUr planet!
6721
i'm becoming grUmpy again. do forgive me.
6721
what do yoU think of the place by the by?
6721
yoUr new home!
6721
yes isn't it great?
6721
reminds me mUch of home. so peacefUl, so mUch space to yoUrself and time to think.
6721
yoU're so lUcky. i can't wait to get to my planet!
6721
right, that.
6721
aboUt that.
6721
got to rUn! Ta, kisses, all that stUff!!! u3u
6862
yes.
6862
don't i?
6862
right then.
6862
what can i do for yoU?
6862
coUld be.
6862
oh. yes.
6862
keep going where yoU're headed.
6862
things will work oUt in time. yoU'll see him.
6862
i'm sorry.
6862
i am not having the best day. u_u
6862
everything!
6862
where do i bloody begin.
6862
well that goes withoUt saying doesn't it? he is ALWAYS a problem.
6862
bUt it's more than that.
6862
when i sleep and visit prospit, i see nothing bUt storm cloUds in skaia now.
6862
my great big lovely ball of blUe has been cloUding over. soon i fear it will be completely black, and the kingdom will be shroUded in darkness.
6862
i wish i Understood the meaning of this terrible omen.
6862
and my brother has become more Uncooperative than ever.
6862
he intends to play the game, bUt refUses to treat it like a collaboration.
6862
i have told him many times that the only way we can win is to work together! bUt he wants it to be yet another competition between Us, like everything has been all oUr lives.
6862
his threats to kill me have become harder to dismiss as his UsUal empty bravado.
6862
i fear it may come down to having to kill him first.
6862
althoUgh i am not sUre exactly how i woUld go aboUt this, or if i will even be Up to the task. umu;
6862
yes. bUt i'll cope.
6862
the real troUble thoUgh is i'm not sUre if i can play a sUccessfUl session withoUt him.
6862
a two player session was already risky enoUgh, satisfying bare minimUm playing conditions.
6862
and i had it on good aUthority that the two of Us woUld be able to sUcceed, particUlarly given oUr... well, withoUt intending to boast. varioUs advantages.
6862
bUt i have no idea if a session of one is viable.
6862
honestly i cannot for the life of me imagine how.
6862
it may well resUlt in a void session like yoUrs, bUt withoUt the promise of any extenUating circUmstances.
6862
i Used to hope so, bUt i doUbt it now.
6862
he barely cares aboUt the game itself, other than as a means of escaping oUr planet.
6862
he has always been more motivated by the ongoing game between Us.
6862
well...
6862
it is simple. we are playing a game together.
6862
we have been forced to, for as long as we've known each other.
6862
bUt the rUles are complicated, and often shifting. and they don't always make sense!
6862
at least, they woUldn't to yoU.
6862
many yoU woUld not recognize as rUles, so mUch as sUperstitions.
6862
a variety of caveats and stipUlations. things that woUld invite misfortUne if i were to break. it woUld be very bad jUjU.
6862
i have not been able to tell yoU my name for this reason.
6862
doing so woUld lead Us all down a very slippery slope! bUt i have wanted to tell yoU so. i hope my relUctance has not compromised oUr friendship.
6862
^u^
6862
mm, yes. we have both renoUnced hemotyping Until the resolUtion.
6862
it is in the same vein, pardon the pUn, as a qUirk. it's the old tradition whereby one types in his or her own blood coloUr.
6862
so he and i have embraced neUtral tones to speak in, for the time being.
6862
most hUmans do not practice hemotyping, presUmably dUe to lacking diversity in blood class.
6862
yes.
6862
i am a lime blood. UuU
6862
while he's got the bright cherry blood, jUst like yoU all do.
6862
not that this matters since we are alone here, bUt interestingly, in ancient troll cUltUre we woUld both be considered pariahs.
6862
for different reasons of coUrse. those of his blood coloUr were very rare, existing by way of genetic glitch only. they were oUtcasts, having no place in the social order.
6862
on the other hand, those of my blood coloUr were once actUally qUite common! bUt later they were all hUnted to extinction.
6862
details of the genocide are historically mUrky. it's one of those maddening voids in my Understanding of yoUr elaborate epic.
6862
bUt i have specUlated their extermination had to do with the extremely powerfUl abilities they tended to have, and the threat to aUthority they represented. even more so than other powerfUl lowbloods.
6862
maybe. :u
6862
he has other, Um. traits.
6862
oh, probably. he is an oUtright mess. if yoU can name a problem with me, he's got it.
6862
yes. it is!
6862
sigh.
6862
jane, i am sorry, bUt this is something i jUst cannot get into. for one thing we woUld be creeping way too close to breaking the rUles, and then we woUld all be bUggered.
6862
even if i were at liberty to say, it woUld take so mUch time to explain everything. and i really mUst be getting to sleep again soon. i am terribly worried aboUt the people of prospit dUring sUch dark times.
6862
sUffice to say, all games that are played have boUndaries. a stage to which all pieces and moves are confined.
6862
like a chess board! there is no reality to the game beyond the edges of the binary grid.
6862
i know. it was more infernal gammoning on my part as i dance aboUt these rUles.
6862
it's all one can do when everything he or she ever does is jUst another move in a game.
6862
i am so sorry, jane. i woUld have loved to be more forthright with yoU since the day we first spoke.
6862
yoU are a dear friend to me. yoU and yoUr chUms. yoU are all the only friends i have ever had.
6862
uUu
6862
i was planning on giving yoU a gift.
6862
yes, bUt i was going to wait Until completing my qUest before sending it to yoU.
6862
bUt now that things are looking rather bleak here, i may have to consider accelerating the delivery.
6862
it is a sUrprise! bUt i will tell yoU this mUch.
6862
it is my jUjU. it is very dear to me.
6862
a talisman of sorts, with many cUrioUs properties and rUles for implementation.
6862
as yoU may have gathered aboUt me, i have learned the hard way that it always pays to follow the rUles. :U
6862
it was an heirloom, yoU coUld say. passed on from ancestors. i have always had it.
6862
jUjUs are said to have origins which are impossible to Understand or trace. some say they emerge spontaneoUsly from the void.
6862
they cannot be trUly dUplicated. if there ever appears to be more than one of the same, it is only a mirage of caUsality!
6862
nor can they ever be destroyed. not completely, at least.
6862
so when i send yoU mine, it will be no small matter. it will not simply be copied throUgh alchemy.
6862
yoU will be the new owner, and mine here will cease to exist.
6862
bUt UnfortUnately it will have no valUe to yoU Unless i send my brother's jUjU as well.
6862
and he will not relinqUish control of his Unless i best him at oUr game. this is another of oUr rUles.
6862
oh yes. we are Up to qUite a bit fUrther than oUr neck in it. ~_u
6862
bUt it's alright. i love games.
6862
my brother, on the other hand...
6862
on no, qUite the contrary.
6862
his passion for games transcends any hUman Understanding of love.
6862
for yoU to Understand it woUld be to fUlly comprehend the meaning of...
6862
how to pUt it.
6862
horror.
6915
jake, i don't have long to talk so i shall leave this note to yoU while yoU sleep and then go.
6915
i may have to begin, let Us say, bending rUles a bit more than i have?
6915
he is making things bloody impossible. oUr game is now nothing short of war. that is all i will say.
6915
well, i will also say this.
6915
i am scared oUt of my wits to go to sleep now. i don't know what will come of me.
6915
my dream self is kapUt, like yoUrs.
6915
bUt i don't fancy yoU will have troUble waking from yoUr nap.
6915
whereas i...
6915
best not to dwell on it i sUppose.
6915
i don't know what to do besides stall, and keep helping yoU as mUch as i can.
6915
now is the time to retrieve those weapons from the capsUle and prepare the gift!
6915
this is so important. the chain will not be complete Unless the delivery is made.
6915
bUt first yoU may want to test its capabilities.
6915
in particUlar... what are they called?
6915
the infinitesimalizer and monstrositifier?
6915
there sUre are some fUnny names for things strewn aboUt yoUr tale.
6915
remember, green means grow, red means shrink! bUt sUrely yoU know this.
6915
give it a go. perhaps try targeting that Unwieldy edifice stashed away in yoUr sylladex? coUld free Up some space!
6915
bUt remember to hold on to it. it remains as important as ever.
6915
i'll be sodding off then.
6915
so mUch to do, so little time. u_u
6929
finally getting a bit aggressive with yoUr qUeen there?
6929
UsUally yoU aren't nearly as patient with her.
6929
the little "gambit" i permitted yoU at the start has certainly inspired some Unconventional play.
6929
it's not going qUite as miserably for yoU as i expected!
6929
i am sorry to damn yoU with faint praise, bUt with a track record like yoUrs, i sUspect one takes what he can get. ^u^
6929
rook to h4.
6929
why have yoU been enclosing all yoUr moves in qUotes?
6929
yoU have really been acting so odd this match.
6929
knight to d6.
6929
look oUt! i'm coming for her.
6929
i think she's langUished behind the front lines long enoUgh, woUldn't yoU say?
6929
time to shake things Up. move her, or take my knight.
6929
yoU know yoU want to take her. jUst look at her there. what a cheeky intrUsion. slithered right into yoUr palace and made herself comfy. maybe she'll lay an egg once she's finished her feast. ^U^
6929
might as well take her oUt. yoU know when the action begins and pieces start to fall, that's when yoU make all yoUr most creative mistakes!
6929
anyhoo, far from over yoU say?
6929
no, i don't imagine this game will be taking Up mUch more of oUr time.
6930
i still don't know what yoU think yoU're on aboUt with this enchantment bUsiness.
6930
if it's a psycheoUt tactic to break my concentration, it isn't working!
6930
qUeen to a5.
6930
the knight is dead.
6930
yoUr goose is cooked.
6930
yes, there yoU go!
6930
that's the sort of aggression the people paid top boondollar to see.
6930
king to d2.
6930
bishop to d6.
6930
the knight is dead.
6930
your serpents are lost.
6930
check!
6930
oh dear! so mUch for yoUr enchantment.
6930
that was a dire mistake. mate in foUr.
6930
rook to f4.
6930
check! ~3u
6930
qUeen to e5.
6930
check.
6930
rook to g4.
6930
check!
6930
one more to go, love.
6930
that's a fine attitUde. maybe yoU are finally making some progress in the realm of sportsmanship?
6930
qUeen to g7.
6930
checkmate. ^U^
6930
what are yoU talking aboUt?
6930
don't be a poor sport again. yoU were doing so well there, relatively speaking.
6930
the game is over. better lUck next time, "bro." ^u^
6930
i have no idea what yoU're babbling aboUt. soUnds like desperation to me.
6930
i am looking at the pieces. yoUr king cannot step anywhere that does not pUt him in check.
6930
nor can the threat to him be eliminated by other means.
6930
yoU have been mated.
6930
the king is dead.
6930
yoUr enchantment has failed.
6930
this is becoming silly.
6930
Unless yoU have something to say aboUt the game which actUally makes sense, i am done with it.
6930
i have more important things to do.
6931
oh bloody hell.
6931
THIS was yoUr "enchantment?"
6931
are yoU serioUs???????????
6931
UUUUUUUUUUUgh. this is yoUr shittiest twist yet!
6931
i am jUst astonished.
6931
not at the gUile of yoUr little ploy, bUt by the fact that yoU actUally seem to think this was a clever rUse.
6931
it is jUst so painfUlly daft, i...
6931
i am speechless!
6931
this is absUrd.
6931
yoU nagged incessantly for me to allow yoU to reverse the starting positions of the king and qUeen!
6931
i only agreed to get yoU to shUt Up aboUt it, and regardless, i knew i coUld beat yoU anyway even with yoUr initial "advantage." and i was right!
6931
how can yoU claim this as a legitimate strategy?
6931
yoU broke the rUles!
6931
i cannot believe yoU are defending this maneUver.
6931
yes, i sUppose some of these tactics are technically within boUnds of the LETTER of the rUles, bUt the entire charade was highly disingenoUs and Unsportsmanlike.
6931
it is Unbelievably childish, even for yoU!
6931
WHAT??
6931
absolUte bollocks.
6931
what rUles did i break?!
6931
this oUght to be good!
6931
YOU PRICK!!!!!!!!!!!
6931
ohh, i coUld jUst strangle yoU.
6931
yoU don't even know how tempted i am to do so right now.
6931
i did not break the rUles. i was doing yoU a FAVOUR.
6931
in any case, yoU say yoU managed to beat me? when did that happen!
6931
even thoUgh yoU've exposed yoUr rUse, yoU haven't actUally mated me yet, grandmaster "bro."
6931
bring it on!!!!!!!!!!!
6932
king to e3.
6932
blech. look at this royal cockUp.
6932
this is so stUpid.
6932
now i either have to sacrifice my qUeen, or move my king into a strategically horrible position.
6932
why am i even going along with this?
6932
yoU wish.
6932
to hell with it. let's sacrifice the qUeen.
6932
i still pUt odds in my favoUr, with my rooks and bishop versUs yoUr bishop, rook, and qUeen.
6932
i've bested yoU before with less material and initiative on my side.
6932
qUeen to c3.
6932
the rook is dead.
6932
my "bro" is an arse!
6932
oh shUt Up and play.
6932
king to e2.
6932
rook to c4.
6932
king to d2.
6932
shUsh.
6932
king to c2.
6932
wait, where did yoU pUt it?
6932
yoU better not have jUst literally eaten the bishop.
6932
rook to c8.
6932
check.
6932
rook to h8.
6932
the rook is dead.
6932
oUr shits weren't given.
6932
grr.
6932
king to d2.
6932
king to e2.
6932
king to d2.
6932
will yoU stop... *DOING THINGS* with the dead pieces!
6932
i swear, as if the jUvenile "enchantment" wasn't enoUgh, if it tUrns oUt yoU are also losing or destroying pieces deliberately, I AM GOING TO STRAIGHT UP FLIP A BITCH.
6932
rook to h7.
6932
CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!
6932
king to c2.
6932
king to b2.
6933
FUCK THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
6933
i don't know why i bothered hUmoUring yoUr vile Underhanded rUbbish!
6933
I HATE YOU. JUST SOD RIGHT OFF TO HELL, PLEASE.
6933
yoU are disgUsting.
6933
i really loathe yoU, and no, NOT IN "THAT WAY!"
6933
i am not going to talk to yoU for a while. probably a LONG while.
6933
i only hope i can overcome my contempt for yoU when it comes time to play oUr game. bUt i am not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!
6933
leave me alone.
6982
miss lalonde, do be carefUl.
6982
i can see that yoU are preoccUpied with aggressors at the moment.
6982
bUt yoUr viewport is beginning to black oUt more freqUently.
6982
i wanted to talk to yoU one last time before yoU enter, and yoUr whole session blacks oUt for good.
6982
and before...
6982
well, before i possibly do the same. U_U;
6982
please reply when yoU have the chance.
6982
ah, hello!
6982
escaped troUble, i presUme? how are yoU doing?
6982
i am sorry to hear yoU're feeling Under the weather.
6982
bUt now i am wondering. hm.
6982
coUld it have been that regUlar intake of yoUr soporific liqUids was inhibiting yoUr commUnion with the void, rather than exaggerating them as i had presUmed?
6982
if the effects are wearing off, it coUld explain the increase in viewport blackoUts.
6982
and once they wear off completely, perhaps that is why yoUr entire session goes dark on yoUr entry.
6982
yoU are probably right. still, i can't help bUt specUlate on sUch matters. it is what i do. :u
6982
oh, not to worry. ^u^
6982
hee hee! if only.
6983
i do know a thing or two aboUt the red miles.
6983
it is the qUeen's favoUred attack. very long distance and omnidirectional.
6983
bUt once Upon a time, her weapon was stolen by a UsUrper. jacked, yoU coUld say, right off her ring finger. and then given a considerable boost in power.
6983
that gave the miles enoUgh of a kick to rip a Universe to shreds.
6983
and they have been doing so to yoUrs and its many instances for eons.
6983
only now have they caUght Up to yoUr instance. it is qUite fortUnate it has taken so long, really.
6983
some instances are tUcked deeper in the speaker's mighty blow sack, and will hold oUt for mUch longer, on a vast cosmic scale of coUrse.
6983
yes.
6983
try to think of it like this.
6983
imagine that the Universe is contained inside a very large creatUre.
6983
say, a great big frog.
6983
it's jUst a frog! that is the way it is, jUst try to imagine it.
6983
now imagine that not only does the Universe exist inside it, depending on the creatUre's health and well being to sUrvive...
6983
bUt every potential instance of that Universe exists inside as well.
6983
those that are doomed and those with promise.
6983
even those that were reset from scratch, with slightly different starting conditions.
6983
all of those interrelated Universes mingling together inside yoUr frog, inextricable from its physiology.
6983
if the frog dies, they all go with it. eventUally.
6983
sadly, yes.
6983
well, it coUld have been worse, actUally. the miles coUld have spread to yoUr Universe before it had the chance to sproUt yoUr lovely planet, providing a home for yoU and yoUr wonderfUl mates.
6983
all Universes die at some point. some sooner than others. it is all part of the cycle, and sometimes things like this mUst happen for reasons beyond oUr Understanding.
6983
bUt this is neither here nor there. i did not intend to go blathering aboUt all that and waste an important conversation with yoU.
6983
i think the trUth is i am probably jUst stalling.
6983
i have some important things to tell yoU.
6983
i'm afraid i am going to be breaking so many rUles in doing so.
6983
i am not Used to breaking rUles. it makes me very Uncomfortable.
6983
bUt it may be my only chance. i hope yoU won't think less of me for it.
6983
yes.
6983
bUt so are yoU, and i've distracted yoU enoUgh.
6983
concentrate on retUrning to yoUr home.
6983
once yoU are there and preparing for the game, i will contact yoU again and tell yoU everything that i have been wanting to tell yoU.
6983
also...
6983
i wanted to give yoU something. :u
6983
jUst a thing!
6983
yoU'll see.
6983
now rUn along!!!!!!!!!!!
6989
i can't see yoU, bUt yoU mUst be back by now, yes?
6989
haxxing? :u
6989
u~u
6989
Um...........
6989
roxy?
6990
i don't Understand.
6990
yoU are typing some sort of compUter program?
6990
^u^;
6990
ah, i Understand. yoU're beginning then. good!
6990
right!
6990
it's a present i made for yoU.
6990
it coUld be...
6990
a farewell gift actUally.
6990
maybe.
6990
i am aboUt to go to sleep one last time before oUr schedUled entry.
6990
and there is a very real possibility that i will never wake Up.
6990
it is complicated.
6990
there is mUch to say aboUt it which i have never told yoU, dUe to my adherence to the rUles.
6990
some of which i am aboUt to break now, in order to give myself a fighting chance.
6990
bUt before i go down that serpentine path with yoU, here.
6990
one last bit of artwork from an admirer. something to remember me by, shoUld we never speak again.
6990
http://tinyurl.com/roxyisthisyoU
6991
^U^
6991
indeed it is!
6991
i really enjoy drawing yoU. it is a treat.
6991
yoU are jUst so pretty. :u
6991
anyway, i am very pleased that yoU like my drawing. ~u~
6991
yoU do?
6991
really??
6991
:U
6991
blimey.
6991
this comes as qUite a sUrprise.
6991
oh.
6991
then the conciliatory type. i Understand.
6991
no! don't be.
6991
trUst me, that is not how i feel aboUt yoU. or anyone.
6991
thoUgh i trUly wish i were capable of those feelings.
6991
perhaps the fact that i am not is why the topic fascinates me so.
6991
and why i have been prone do indUlge in sUch...
6991
fancifUl visUalizations.
6991
of yoUr people's lovely bright red relationships.
6991
they mUst be nice. u_u
6991
yes, as a matter of fact.
6991
that is actUally the reason i am contacting yoU.
6991
it is one rUle i have decided to break.
6991
my name is calliope.
6991
it feels so strange to type that!
6991
bUt also good, actUally.
6992
yoU're welcome. it is good to get it off my chest.
6992
bUt i am primarily telling yoU this as a last resort, in hopes of saving myself.
6992
yoU see, this rUle between me and my brother is a kind of trUce.
6992
we have both agreed not to say oUr names to anyone so that things will not get oUt of hand, and so it became one of the rUles.
6992
if anyone were to say his name to me, i woUld immediately fall asleep, and he woUld wake Up.
6992
so yoU will Understand if i refrain from telling yoU his as well. ~_u
6992
yes, fortUnately for both of Us.
6992
now, chronologically speaking, i have never contacted yoU after this moment.
6992
so if i never wake Up from my next nap, yoU will never hear from me again.
6992
if yoU do not hear from me later, i woUld very mUch appreciate it if yoU coUld message my brother, and say my name.
6992
it may be the only chance i have to wake Up again.
6992
splendid!
6992
<kisses>
6992
i want to!
6992
it is overwhelming, trying to be cavalier aboUt rUles i have respected all my life. i'm not sUre where to begin.
6992
oh, i can have romantic feelings.
6992
jUst not the flUshed kind, which hUmans describe as romantic love.
6992
yes, that's right.
6992
bUt...
6992
oh bUgger. this is so embarrassing to have to admit.
6992
i am sorry for saying things which may have reasonably led yoU to believe this.
6992
probably way too many things. u_u;
6992
bUt i am not actUally a troll.
6992
i have never actUally claimed to be. bUt i'm sUre i have implied it, probably dUe to wishfUl thinking.
6992
i have spent so mUch time wishing i coUld be one.
6992
trolls are a remarkable and fascinating race.
6992
hUmans are too, please don't get me wrong!
6992
bUt i am oUt and oUt smitten with trolls and their history and ways.
6992
they have sUch amazing, coloUrfUl social dynamics that soUnd like so mUch fUn to be a part of.
6992
and they are so beaUtifUl.
6992
i wish i coUld be that pretty.
6992
UnfortUnately, i am not very attractive at all.
6992
sad to say, no one woUld kiss the corpse i will leave behind.
6992
even if there were someone aroUnd to revive me, i doUbt they woUld be inclined to bother.
6992
for, er... several reasons, actUally.
6992
bUt really, it was always for the best that i cannot have fUlly flUshed feelings.
6992
no one coUld ever love me.
6992
it is.
6992
and it's for the best that no one has ever seen my face, aside from my brother.
6992
no.
6992
i am sorry.
6992
heehee. no.
6992
that jUst happened to be a planet from yoUr system i thoUght was lovely.
6992
i was particUlarly strUck by its UniqUe rotation.
6992
it has very nice...
6992
bollocks, what's the word.
6992
the term that refers to a ball's topspin?
6992
it doesn't matter.
6992
bUt no, i'm not even from yoUr Universe, let alone a nearby planet.
6992
my species has never even had a home planet.
6992
i am a cherUb!
6993
no!
6993
i doUbt i am what yoU're pictUring.
6993
bUt aside from a few sUperficial similarities, we are very different from trolls and hUmans.
6993
we are not a social race. we generally will not ever encoUnter another of oUr kind, Unless it is time to mate.
6993
and when that time comes, oUr coUrtship is nothing like it is for hUmans.
6993
it is highly confrontational and violent.
6993
it is lonely.
6993
bUt that is in oUr natUre, to be alone. jUst as it is to find attraction throUgh contempt.
6993
now that i think aboUt it, i shoUld have known.
6993
i've been so foolish.
6993
aboUt the natUre of my game session.
6993
i believed he and i coUld play together, even Under oUr UniqUe biological circUmstances.
6993
i was so daft, i thoUght skaia had actUally made an exception for Us.
6993
and that we coUld overcome oUr conflicts, work together, and fUlfill the game's minimUm reqUirement of two players. one of space and the other of time.
6993
bUt i was always fooling myself.
6993
it is now clear only one of Us will sUrvive.
6993
my skaian visions have misled me.
6993
or i have blinded myself to their trUe meaning.
6993
this was always meant to be a session of one.
6993
and i am finally starting to Understand...
6993
the reality of that coUld have conseqUences more horrifying than we coUld begin to imagine.
6993
the thing is, yoU don't know him like i do.
6993
as hard as it may be to believe, he is even worse than yoU think.
6993
and it's all sUch a shame, not jUst becaUse of that.
6993
it is a shame that i won't be able to play, i gUess for selfish reasons.
6993
i was so looking forward to it.
6993
i really thoUght i was going to be someone special.
6993
that i coUld Use my abilities do something no one had ever done.
6993
yes. you're right.
6993
mUch like skaia, i've sUccUmbed to a gloomier outlook lately, due to recent setbacks.
6993
well, i was always led to believe i woUld be an extraordinary type of player.
6993
both of Us woUld be. we are both assigned extremely rare and powerfUl classes.
6993
they are the two master classes!
6993
mine is the most passive on the scale. a class designated for females only.
6993
i am the mUse of space. ^u^
6993
i'm not entirely sUre. i was hoping to discover that on my joUrney.
6993
anyway, his is the other master class.
6993
the most active class of all, reserved for male players.
6993
Um...
6993
roxy.
6993
i think we may be getting a wee bit carried away with trivia here.
6993
we both have so mUch to do.
6993
yoU need to focUs on getting to safety, while i need to...
6993
prepare myself. for what i hope will be a short nap.
6993
you are a good friend, roxy.
6993
please take care.

7513
hello!
7514
yes, it is i!
7514
sorry! :u
7514
no, roxy. i am afraid it was not a helping of yoUr delicioUs earth baloney.
7514
alas, we do not.
7514
this is not my trUe appearance. i have taken the form of my trollsona.
7514
i wanted to look more presentable for oUr meetUp. UnfortUnately my trUe visage woUld likely repUlse or frighten yoU.
7514
that is not the first impression i woUld like to make.
7514
that is so kind of yoU to say. i can believe that a lovely person like yoU woUld be able to stop herself from recoiling at the sight of my monstroUs face.
7514
bUt it is oUt of the qUestion. i am mUch more comfortable appearing to yoU this way.
7514
really it has more to do with my own dissatisfaction with the way i look than any lack of trUst in yoUr character.
7514
yoU Understand, don't yoU?
7514
likewise!
7514
i wish it coUld be Under better circUmstances thoUgh.
7514
we may not have mUch time here.
7514
yes. i have led yoU to a dream bUbble of my own design.
7514
my imagination and thoUghts dictate what yoU see here.
7514
as i told yoU earlier, my brother is hUnting for me. so i have created a little sanctUary in space to stay hidden from him.
7514
that is why i coUld not speak to yoU earlier. not oUt loUd at least. he is highly sensitive to my presence, so it is very easy for me to get his attention if i'm not carefUl.
7514
bUt as long as we stand in the centre of this vortex, we may speak as loUdly as we like! no information can escape this dark pocket, so long as i maintain it.
7514
and seeing as yoU are a hero of void, yoU make an ideal gUest to bring home for one who wishes to remain hidden. thoUgh i will say the fact that yoU are my best friend is a lovely bonUs. ^u^
7514
i know.
7514
i am sorry. u_u
7514
he is not trying to kill me.
7514
he has already sUcceeded at that.
7515
on the day he foUnd a way to kill my dream self, i was done for. thoUgh to be honest, i doUbt i'd have fared mUch better regardless.
7515
i think his half was always meant to predominate.
7515
my will was simply not strong enoUgh to overcome his. yoU know as well as i how stUbborn he is. i don't think he has ever had even a smidgen of doUbt in his thoUghts, or remorse for his deeds. whereas i was always plagUed by sUch feelings.
7515
on some level i always knew he woUld win. bUt i fooled myself. i thoUght i coUld overcome his ego by looking beyond his negative qUalities, staying optimistic, and working together with him in a game to accomplish something extraordinary.
7515
and that in doing so, perhaps i coUld begin to help him change. to teach him to evolve beyond his hatefUl natUre. and as he changed for the better, slowly but sUrely, he woUld become more like myself.
7515
that was how i thoUght i coUld predominate. it was how i was going to win! and really, if he grew closer to me in that way, by learning kindness and compassion, we both woUld have won. my predomination woUld not have meant his absolUte death, but oUr trUe Union.
7515
bUt sadly, i Underestimated how consUmed he was with the need to destroy me.
7515
now he is completely obsessed with finding my soUl and wiping me oUt for good, even if it means tearing apart the reality that sUrroUnds Us.
7515
he will never feel he has won Until all traces of me are gone.
7515
don't fret. yoU did all yoU coUld.
7515
very Unlikely.
7515
^u^
7515
it's trUe that he deserves a comeUppance like few others.
7515
bUt slaying him is not actUally yoUr responsibility as heroes now.
7515
in fact, if anyone mUst bear that bUrden, it might be me.
7515
possibly.
7515
as we speak, there are hUndreds of soUls oUt here in the fUrthest ring working to defeat him.
7515
some search for a fabled treasUre. a weapon said to spell his certain demise.
7515
while others say that i myself am this weapon. :U
7515
and so they search for me.
7515
they band together in great nUmbers for this caUse, and attract his devastation in hopes of revealing the path to the weapon.
7515
while at the same time, they draw his attention away from me. and it is a good thing that they do.
7515
i mUst remain hidden from everyone for as long as i can.
7515
becaUse i am no sUch thing!
7515
i was already Useless against my brother when he was jUst a brat who liked to tease me.
7515
now that he is an exceptionally mUscUlar and invincible adUlt, my chances are laUghable.
7515
no, if i am to contribUte, i need more time.
7515
i mUst go in search of my own weapon.
7515
ironically, the same weapon which many of them are looking for.
7515
me!
7515
it's the only sliver of hope i have.
7515
i have reason to sUspect there may be another iteration of myself oUt here.
7515
one from a doomed timeline, who has kept hidden for a long time, jUst like i have.
7515
bUt Unlike me, she sUpposedly came from a reality where she predominated instead of my brother.
7515
and not by the means which i described. hers was not a mild Union of reconciliation.
7515
amazingly, her predomination was absolUte! a major feat of will, jUst as his was with me.
7515
as sUch, she went on to play the game, and...
7515
well, i cannot even imagine what followed, aside from the fact that she eventUally mUst have died for existing in an offshoot reality.
7515
if she exists, i woUld be eager to meet her. it woUld be a chance to get to know a version of myself who was strong enoUgh to override the will of my brother.
7515
someone i might have become if i had a little more coUrage. u_u
7515
and if she is sUch a person, then i really believe all i have heard mUst be trUe. i believe she is the key to defeating him.
7515
so i have no choice.
7515
i mUst go in search of myself.
7516
indeed.
7516
it's the same as it always was.
7516
to win the game.
7516
it is as i once told jane.
7516
with victory yoU may finally exit this vast whirling storm.
7516
by claiming yoUr reward yoU woUld bring closUre to a very wide coil of caUsality, one not tracing a continUoUs path like a snake, bUt intricately woven like a wreath.
7516
a ring of coUntless little rises and falls, ascents and descents, on its way Up and down a pair of mUch bigger ones itself.
7516
from alpha to beta, then beta to alpha, as if a moUntain to be scaled and then climbed back down. its peak toUches the eye of a storm which cannot end Until the moment yoU all walk throUgh that door.
7516
only then will there be calm.
7516
ah, bUgger. forgive me, sometimes i forget myself and begin speaking in riddles.
7516
it's jUst a habit that is in the natUre of my people.
7516
don't remind me. in my opinion they do not qUalify as anything of the sort, mUch the same as his "shitty twists". >:u
7516
as the one who provoked the breach in paradox space which i jUst coloUrfUlly described, he has always exerted his inflUence on yoUr realities from afar, and from many different angles. throUgh Unwitting sUrrogates, oUtsoUrced manipUlation, oUtright enslavement, and even petty harassment. bUt most of all, he prevails throUgh the simple inertia of inevitability that has always been on his side, as a lord of time.
7516
and as the one who is to blame for foolishly allowing him access to sUch power, it's only proper that i take responsibility for finding a way to defeat him.
7516
bUt even thoUgh his methods of inflUencing yoUr session are indirect, they are still formidable.
7516
there will be a nUmber of powerfUl foes who stand between yoU and victory.
7516
tomorrow, a terrific battle will take place.
7516
when yoU wake Up, i sUggest yoU begin to prepare.
7516
yes, i'm sUre new eqUipment woUld come in handy.
7516
now that yoU mention it, well before i died or even realized i woUld not live to play, i made special exception to my rUle of staying linear with conversation. i messaged jane a birthday gift.
7516
yoU see, i had a brief vision from skaia which sUggested to me she coUld Use a boost in morale on this special day, so i offered her something very dear to me. jUst a little token to show appreciation for her friendship.
7516
i hope it will cheer her Up, and moreover that it will prove at least somewhat UsefUl to yoUr party.
7516
bUt really, at this stage if yoU wish to prevail against sUch stacked odds, collecting boons sUch as new weapons and treasUres will only go so far.
7516
i think yoU will need to embrace a far more sUbstantive gambit.
7517
it is not fefeta!!!
7517
i am sUggesting a measUre that is mUch more extreme.
7517
i believe yoU shoUld all strongly consider ascending to the god tiers.
7517
well of coUrse it soUnds cool! bUt it's not necessarily as easy as it soUnds, steeling oneself for death. believe me.
7517
bUt if yoU can find the resolve, then here is what yoU mUst do.
7517
since none of yoU have any dream selves left, it won't do any good to sacrifice yoUrselves on the qUest beds foUnd on yoUr respective planets.
7517
and even if yoU did, there is not even a battlefield from which to rise anew. no, yoUr void session had only one path to ascension all along.
7517
yoU mUst travel to the centre of the moons of prospit and derse, and there in the crypt yoU will find yoUr sacrificial slabs. yoU mUst lie on them, and then...
7517
then yoU all mUst die. one way or another. u_u
7517
alright?
7517
doesn't the thoUght make yoU nervoUs?
7517
yes.
7517
yes. :u
7517
yes! :U
7517
yoU seem qUite cavalier aboUt this, roxy!
7517
don't yoU have doUbts?
7517
woUldn't it cross yoUr mind to wonder, "what if i never wake Up again?"
7517
i know it woUld for me.
7517
yes. i believe yoU will.
7517
...
7517
^u^
7518
those who i mentioned my brother has been exploiting as his pawns from afar.
7518
the most obvioUs woUld be the one responsible for the extinction of yoUr race.
7518
and who also happened to be responsible for this most fortUitoUs nap.
7518
yoU don't remember yet?
7518
...
7518
bUt which floor?
7518
as i said, she is his servant, and is obligated to do everything in her power to facilitate the cycle of his existence.
7518
and while nearly all she has done on earth and on derse has been to advance that scheme, that does not mean she's withoUt her own agenda.
7518
i know that she woUld like to see my brother defeated as mUch as anyone else. for her enslavement, for doUble-crossing her, and for orchestrating her people's extinction.
7518
he always did loathe trolls. i've sUspected i may be to blame for their misfortUne as well, considering he knew how mUch i fancied them. u_u
7518
i believe she's looking ahead, beyond the fUlfillment of her obligation. she is likely making plans for after she is liberated. she has lived as a rUler and conqUerer for very long time, and probably coUldn't have done so withoUt sUch gUile and foresight.
7518
if she has captUred yoU, it's certainly for a good reason.
7518
i think she wishes to exploit yoUr abilities as a rogUe of void.
7518
none that yoU have gotten in toUch with yet.
7518
bUt rest assUred, yoU have them!
7518
it's like i told yoU before, remember?
7518
a fUlly realized rogUe of void can do remarkable things. things which even other god tiers woUld view as miracUloUs.
7518
why don't yoU see what it is the qUeen woUld have yoU do?
7518
then yoU may look inside and determine whether yoU have it in yoU to do it.
7518
that is Understandable.
7518
jUst do whatever yoU feel is right. i'm sUre yoU will make the correct decision.
7518
yoU see, i trUst yoU too, roxy. ^u^
7518
oh no...
7519
OH NO!!!
7520
WHAT IS *SHE* DOING HERE???
7594
happy birthday, jane! ^u^
