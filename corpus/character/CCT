D --> I'd like to add to this useless memorandum
D --> That I still don't recognize the validity of your leadership
D --> It may be true that we are all playing in the same session, but I see no reason to disband the former power structure
D --> Especially if it means instituting a tactical midget with a short fuse, a foul mouth, and paralyzing insecurity over the color of his b100d
D --> That's all I have to say
D --> Uh
D --> Not usually
D --> Nowhere have I seen evidence of this
D --> Most of this is you from various points in time raving about nonsense and arguing with yourself
D --> Do you realize that here in the future, this bulletin has come to be regarded as something of a joke
D --> A lengthy piece of comedy, often quoted amongst ourselves in private moments of levity
D --> It seems I'm the one to inform you of this up front
D --> Which is likely why you persist with the ingratiating charade against better judgement
D --> What do you mean
D --> How do you know about my perspiration problem
D --> I mean, aside from reading about it in this memo
D --> Wait
D --> Fudgesicles
