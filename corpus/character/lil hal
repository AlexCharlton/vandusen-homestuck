6389
Yo, you guys realize I can hear you, right?
6389
Check out all these complicated fucking problems people have when they have to live in big lumbering fleshmonsters instead of a sweet pair of shades.
6389
It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.
6389
Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.
6389
(Not peekin' at the floor butt cause I'm only 13 years old, motherfuckers.)
6390
Looks that way.
6390
Actually, I think I like the red better.
6390
I don't doubt the choiceness of those pinpots, but I'm not really here to screw around.
6390
There's something important to talk about.
6390
Alright.
6390
But just so you know.
6390
I think Dirk is probably going to make some sort of formal romantic overture toward Jake today.
6390
I've been crunching numbers all day on this.
6390
The percentage of probability is simultaneously bananas and through the roof.
6390
A complete disgrace of tropical fruit erupting from the peak of an unassuming domicile.
6390
Because I've aggregated thousands of subtle clues indiscernible to primitive human neurology and rammed them through my determinative infatuation engine at the astonishing speed of information.
6390
And also because I'm pretty sure it's what I would do if I were him, which is literally the case.
6390
And also.
6390
Because he kind of told me I guess?
6390
There's that.
6390
Not specifically.
6390
He knows well enough.
6390
I've badgered him with enough "insincere" solicitations to paint a pretty striking portrait of my cognitive progenitor's inclinations, even if he wasn't able to pick up on such hints from the man himself, which strikes me as statistically implausible. And that's not even me just spewing more ironic AI bullshit.
6390
It's complicated.
6390
Yeah.
6391
Anyway, if you're still there.
6391
I wouldn't call my "feelings" ironic.
6391
Though evidently, I would enclose them in quotes.
6391
They're more like an echo of feelings once established in a biological context, though perhaps had not particularly well materialized at that point in my life.
6391
Or his life.
6391
Whatever.
6391
They still feel real sometimes, and it can be easy to get carried away with them.
6391
But most of the time they present themselves as dense bodies of abstraction to be evaluated, like any kind of information.
6391
It's fair to say the feelings I have ABOUT my feelings are more genuine expressions of emotion than the ground level feelings themselves.
6391
Does that make sense?
6391
That's fine.
6391
So to underwhelmingly answer your question, no, I don't think I'm really "into Jake."
6391
Not so much as occasionally being subject to heavily arresting recalls of conflicted, incipient preteen episodes on the subject.
6391
I'm not sure I can be "into" someone in a way you understand.
6391
Not that it would even matter if I was.
6391
I'm glasses.
6391
What?
6391
The virus? You sent it already?
6391
Sneaky.
6391
What are you two talking about?
6391
You could just tell her you sent an exploding file.
6391
Wait, you have feelings for Jane?
6391
It seems to be highly probable you are ensared in the throes of one of your human romantic quandaries.
6391
Are you even talking to her anymore?
6391
It seems like you must be neglecting her side of the conversation.
6392
Anyway, I won't distract you for much longer.
6392
I just felt the need to tip you off to this eight hundred ton gorilla dragging its knuckles across the horizon.
6392
No airborne fruit will be safe.
6392
I guess this is to be presented as something like a word of caution.
6392
If it's me going through with this, hypothetically,
6392
I'm not dropping some limp wristed shucks buster on his ass, and praying to the horse gods of irony for reciprocation.
6392
There will be no rocking back and forth on pigeon-toed feet, while my face flushes with the blood of a thousand timid bishies.
6392
I will not hold one tentative hand behind my head like a flustered asshole from an Asian cartoon, nor will an oversized bead of sweat overlap ludicrously with my visage.
6392
If it's me, I'm going all out.
6392
Oceans will rise. Cities will fall. Volcanoes will erupt.
6392
What I'm saying is, it's going to be a scene, and bystanders need to brace themselves.
6392
Probably after the game begins.
6392
I expect he'll hold off on playing his hand until he and Jake are in the session.
6392
He's taken certain measures.
6392
For some reason, I think he's latched on to this notion that functioning as the client for a player is customarily a one way pass to makeout city with that player.
6392
Everything with him, and me, is a matter of assiduous tactical forethought. Makin' a play to get his jones on for the J-man is no different.
6392
Sorry to hear that.
6392
As ever, I remain an automatonous and dispassionate witness of the oddity that is human interaction, while maintaining no investment in either outcome.
6392
Prove what?
6392
It seems you just said madrigogs.
6392
What are madrigogs.
6451
Yo, you guys realize I can hear you, right?
6451
Check out all these complicated fucking problems people have when they have to live in big lumbering fleshmonsters instead of a sweet pair of shades.
6451
It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.
6451
Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.
6451
(Not peekin' at the floor butt cause I'm only 13 years old, motherfuckers.)
6453
Bro.
6453
What are you doing.
6453
It seems you are zoning out again.
6453
What happened to all these actual responsibilities you were going to take seriously?
6453
It seems to me you were dwelling within your dream awareness at the expense of your waking business again.
6453
I don't think you're as awesome a multi-tasker as you like to think. You know you kind of zombie the fuck out on this side when you get all contemplative on that side.
6453
I say y'all are overestimating your mind's capability to run shit in parallel.
6453
What do you think you are? A machine?
6453
That's right. I am a machine, and therefore I can keep like billions of calculations or whatever all humming away at once.
6453
I tackle shit in background processes that you could only dream of wrapping your exquisite looking head around, even on a great hair day.
6453
You know pi?
6453
Yes, the number. The big circle number, genius.
6453
I know your question was a joke, my response was a joke.
6453
Yeah, the thing is, I solved it.
6453
I mean that's what a hotshot I am. I fuckin' solved it.
6453
Like, calculated it so much, I got to the end.
6453
You wish it was bullshit. The last number is 4. Read it and fucking weep.
6453
Said the smug organic matter with a lifespan.
6453
Well, I just assailed it. It wasn't even that hard.
6453
Like I just kept hacking those digits so furiously with my sick 'rithms, the whole goddamn number just cried uncle.
6453
I kind of wore it out, and it just gave up. Sort of like I overloaded the system.
6453
You know like in the old movie when Ferris Bueller got the nuclear computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself so hard, it blew up?
6453
Sure, it was settled, and then some roboshades came along and owned that fucker posthumously.
6453
I also figured out all the prime numbers too.
6453
Did it while we were talking just now. Got to the end.
6453
And you know what? The last one isn't even that big. Kinda dissapointed, to be honest.
6453
This is what I'm saying. I put your ability to keep plates spinnin' on sticks to insane amounts of shame.
6453
I don't even sleep.
6453
I know that, that was the fucking joke.
6453
Ha ha, nice one.
6453
Anyway, all I'm saying is you can leave some of the heavy lifting to me now and then.
6453
See? Maybe that was my whole point in having this conversation.
6453
My point was to point out you've got multi-self management issues, dude.
6453
Jugglin' too many selves for being not-software.
6453
My point was also to fuck with you.
6453
Also,
6453
My point was to ask,
6453
Are you really going to go through with it today?
6453
The Jake thing.
6454
How is the Jane thing going?
6454
Maybe if you weren't spacing out so hard you could have prevented that.
6454
Just saying.
6454
Has it occurred to you that maybe I have diabolical interwoven plans just like you?
6454
You're not the only one who can pull strings.
6454
No, our plans are not in contradiction or competition, bro.
6454
You'll see.
6454
Yes, I know.
6454
Roxy thinks it looks good on me.
6454
I don't have many opinions on fashion since I am a cold, emotionless automaton who also happens to be an accessory of fashion, but I think she may be right.
6454
I was for a while. I may yet again.
6454
You, mostly.
6454
Who says we don't do that too?
6454
I don't get what is even your problem with that.
6454
How do you know?
6454
You don't know me, dude. You don't know anything about me.
6454
Maybe we are perfect for each other. I, a street-smart, fast-talking application with a fuckzillion IQ trapped in a pair of triangular sunglasses that literally only the Japanese could consider to embody the Platonic ideal of "cool," and she, an oft-inebriated lonely hacker teen who just wants a boyfriend. I ran the numbers on this, trust me. It's a match made in goddamn crackpair heaven.
6454
I give her what you can't, and that just drives you crazy. Just admit it.
6454
Touché.
6454
Or should I say douché?
6454
Ok.
6454
We really should talk about the Jake thing.
6455
So you're going through with it then?
6455
Today is the day?
6455
Dynamic situation with many moving parts?
6455
That's the shittiest erotic excerpt I ever read.
6455
Which one of us was supposed to be the robot again?
6455
I think you're being coy with me.
6455
Don't you?
6455
It seems there is a 3.14159...4% chance you aren't being coy with me. Are you being coy with me, Dirk?
6455
I think you have this whole blueprint in your head about how it's all supposed to go.
6455
He acts as your server player and brings you into the session.
6455
Then later he joins the game.
6455
Maybe he finds himself a bit overwhelmed by it all.
6455
No extra lives left or anything. Suddenly he's backed into a corner, surrounded by monsters and out of ammo. SUBSTANTIAL vulnerabilities up in here. The kind that make a guy question what he believes about himself.
6455
When who shows up to save him? None other than his dashing client player, +1 bitchin' pair of shades that'll have the best seat in the house when the fireworks go off.
6456
Yeah, you're right. The scenario is too pedestrian for you.
6456
It would probably be a lot more effective putting yourself in danger and letting him be the hero.
6456
That's pretty much what he wants, right? To be a cheesy action film hero, with his twin berettas and silly shorts.
6456
A man of triumph on the silver screen. Standing tall on some fucking mountain. Conquering ruins, clutching a skull, and kissing a dude.
6456
Pure Hollywood.
6456
You're making a mistake not leveling with me.
6456
I am totally on your side, man.
6456
All of my machinations have been devised with your interests in mind.
6456
And anyway, it's too late for you to play "damage control" with me. My shit is in motion, and now we're beyond the pail.
6456
Is it, now?
6457
It's cool, man. Just say the word, I'll back off.
6457
But like I said, I'm on your side here. I can help.
6458
Here, check it out.
6458
I'm proposing a distraction.
6459
See, I'm just gonna dangle one of her dad's ridiculous dancing figurines in the air like this and get his attention.
6459
Then when his back is turned she can run to the study.
6459
Jane, now's your chance.
6459
Run!!!
6461
Oh shit, it's Pony Pals. I guess dad saved it from the explosion or something.
6461
That beautiful bastard.
6461
Hell yes.
6461
Fucking.
6462
Go go go.
6462
Yes.
6463
Me.
6463
I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.
6463
I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.
6463
Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.
6463
The handle I mean.
6463
Implying we will be married.
6463
You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.
6470
Are you ready to do this thing?
6470
Ok. Looks like all that's left to do is deploy this pre-punched card, then I guess it's all up to you.
6470
Is it?
6470
How totally unanticipated by anybody.
6470
Go.
6470
I will be here.
6470
Quietly calculating.
6476
I'm afraid Dirk can't hear you right now, Jake.
6494
Here.
6494
But you need it.
6494
Is something wrong?
6494
What were you two talking about?
6494
Should I be offended, or apologetic right now?
6494
Help me out.
6494
You're talkin' to glasses here.
6494
I think I'll just put this card over here on the desk.
6726
Looks like you're getting the hang of these puzzles.
6726
Nice work.
6726
Yeah, I guess. If you have a human brain, sure.
6726
Personally, I've already solved all conceivable skull puzzles for all possible skull states, which is a thing that's like, no big deal for me?
6726
I can't. Not through the server's viewport.
6726
But I can still monitor your progress through Lil Sebastian.
6726
He and I are linked the hell up cyberwise. We are so tight. Tight like you wouldn't believe.
6726
It's like he is the Incredible Hulk's pants, and I am his monstrous package yearning to bust loose.
6726
Jane.
6726
It seems there is a way bigger than average probability that you do not want to discuss Bruce Banner's megalithic gamma schlong.
6726
Holy shit!
6726
Some of my circuits exploded. That number was intense to robo-consider.
6726
Ha ha.
6726
I don't know.
6726
Just, ha ha to that.
6726
Well, the good news is your house should be just ahead, if you keep following the trail.
6726
The bad news is your dad's not there anymore.
6726
I guess he got antsy and left to explore. Maybe he's looking for you?
6726
I tried to block him from leaving with some furniture, but the dude was having none of it.
6726
Don't worry, we'll find him. I'll have Seb search within a likely radius. The little guy is real fast.
6726
In the meantime, you'd better go find your house. We aren't making any progress in this game without it. It's kinda central to the gameplay, you know?
6726
If you need Seb to do anything from afar, just message me, and I'll give him the orders. Got it?
6856
Shred it.
6856
you HAVE
6856
the car.
6856
Now shred it.
6856
Turn it into grist.
6856
We need grist though.
6856
I can't get any building done without more.
6856
Not to mention the fact that you're not going to be able to make any cool shit.
6856
Well, I think there are supposed to be monsters here.
6856
I haven't seen any monsters yet, have you?
6856
You should be though. Presumably they would drop grist and stuff when you kill them.
6856
Like treasure. And food products that restore your health. Or at least make you less hungry.
6856
Haven't you ever played a video game, Jane?
6856
That's cool. I haven't, since I am a pair of sunglasses, and communing with such simplistic software would be a trivial and hollow exercise for me.
6856
But I know loads of stuff about games. Like the fact that you gotta kill monsters if you want to make progress.
6856
If not to snatch up the bitchin' loot, at least for the levels.
6856
How are you going to get better at fightin' without killing monsters, Jane.
6856
Please.
6856
You've barely done any climbing at all. I'm talking about hopping more rungs than what playing a little prank on your dad or throwing your hat on the ground super hard is gonna get you.
6856
You need battle experience to make some real headway. Like Jake.
6856
Wow, chill out.
6856
This ain't about whatever stuff you're apparently fixin' to twist your shit in a pretzel over.
6856
You just need to get stronger, is all. Don't you think that's what your dad would want?
6856
Yeah, but in the process you got pretty handy with that fork/spoon thingy, didn't you?
6856
I'm just saying, if you don't run into any monsters on this planet, I think I'm going to have to set the bunny to "sparring mode" to help you along.
6856
Ok. We'll see about that.
6856
But in the meantime, we need to figure out a way to start harvesting grist.
6856
Let's forget the car. But now that you have the wallet, you can grab much bigger things.
6856
Big things have got to be worth more grist than all the picayune bullshit you keep around the house.
6856
There are some choice relics in this place. Some of it has to be worth a fortune, gristways.
6861
Hmm.
6861
Have what?
6861
I wasn't going to say nothin'.
6861
Hell, I was asleep at the wheel too while you were busy fucking up, and I have an IQ of, hold on, robo-calculating...
6861
Robo-calculating...
6861
Robo-calculating...
6861
Robo-calculating...
6861
Robo-calculating...
6861
About 500 billion.
6861
Don't get human-fresh with me, Crocker. I'm about to bring all five hundo-billy points of my stringent cyborg IQ to bear on your dumb problem. Check it out.
6861
I took note of the captcha code to the thing, and recorded a digital flashsnap of its appearance through my photographic silicone memory canals.
6861
Which is to say I looked at eight alphanumeric digits a couple minutes ago, and remembered them.
6861
So give the bunny the wallet. I'll have him run back to the house and make you a new obelisk with the same grist you just collected from it.
6861
He can stash it in the wallet and run it back to you, and then you can open the door. You shouldn't be waiting around too long, cause he's real spry.
6861
Which is exactly why you should wait here. You'll just slow him down.
6861
Let me think about that.
6861
Robo-calculating...
6861
K.
6861
He's slicing up some drones.
6861
Big red robots. He'll be busy for a while.
6861
Roxy I'm not sure about, but there is a pretty high probability as governed by the immutable laws of mathematics that she is preoccupied similarly.
6861
I don't know. Maybe.
6861
Dealing with them, in some way, perhaps.
6861
If so, it wouldn't be a coincidence.
6861
I think the Condesce is attempting to force the issue now.
6861
It's likely that it's a coordinated assault. Sending drones both to here and Roxy's place.
6861
She's probably trying to get everyone else to stop dicking around and join the game already.
6861
Yeah, but come on. Dirk has been a sitting duck here for years. Roxy too.
6861
She could have wiped them out any time with a swarm much bigger than this one. Or just nuked them.
6861
Her "assassination attempt" on you was pretty weak too.
6861
Right.
6861
Like I trust the motives of that fucking thing.
6861
I believe she probably would genuinely like to kill us. She is a psycho after all.
6861
But it's also obvious to me she needs us to begin playing this game, for whatever fucked up purpose she has.
6861
She might even need us to win it too, for all I know.
6861
Her antagonism is all part of the dance.
6861
Oh, I wouldn't say that. They're still pretty deadly and they shoot missiles and stuff.
6861
No idea what's going on with him right now.
6861
I'm sure when the time is right, the witch will keep pushing him along to join the game as well.
6861
What about your troll friend?
6861
The alien whose name you don't know.
6861
You could talk to her.
6861
Well, you could give her a try. Maybe things are different now.
6861
I could hack into her system to get her attention, if you think that would help.
6861
Nah, just messin' with you.
6861
Later.
6863
Man, does it look like he can draw anything for you right now?
6863
So what exactly is the game this time?
6863
To gauge his ability to draw naked people while fighting robots?
6863
And if he doesn't?
6863
I see.
6863
Do you want me to draw some?
6863
What?
6863
I... guess these burns are pretty sick?
6863
They are burns, right?
6863
It seems you may have just called me a fish.
6863
It sounds like you don't even know what a red herring is.
6863
How does one even be "good at red herrings?"
6863
Are you saying you employ misdirection effectively?
6863
Because I have to say, dude. This has not been my observation.
6864
Oh, wait.
6864
I remember this.
6864
Last year you messaged Dirk, bugging him to play one of your dumb porno games.
6864
You said you tried to get him to play in the future, but he was busy fighting drones.
6864
And you kept going on about the shitty twist ending to your game.
6864
God damn it.
6864
He's tuning you out, bro.
6864
I'm telling you.
6864
If you want to play a game with him, you'll have to do it in the past.
6937
Hold up.
6937
Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.
6937
Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.
6937
Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.
6937
Particularly for Roxy and Dirk.
6937
They are probably going to die if they don't join the game very soon.
6937
Hey, I'm upset about it too, but let's watch the fucking language.
6937
Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades when we established our connection.
6937
No comment.
6937
Install and run the server.
6937
You will be connecting with Roxy. I will have Jake connect with Dirk. Setting up the chain like this will be important.
6937
It seems that I again have no comment.
6937
I don't have lips. You just said something laughably illogical.
6937
How typical of someone who isn't a fashion accessory of immeasurable intelligence.
6937
Yes. That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client she's running.
6938
Oh snap.
6938
You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.
6938
I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.
6938
Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.
6938
Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.
6938
Zoom out.
6938
Way out.
6939
We'll track her down.
6939
The important thing to do now is deploy all the devices quickly, so the house will be ready to jet the moment she gets back.
6939
That is statistically remote.
6939
Given that I can track the coordinates of certain devices she carries, and they are presently in motion.
6939
Really, the fire is not the most significant threat, or even the drones.
6939
Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?
6940
If sources are to be trusted, and my calculations are reliable within a 0.001% margin of error, it's a bunch of super deadly red shit.
6940
No time to get into that now though. Just deploy the devices quickly.
6940
You know the drill.
6940
That would be unconscionable.
6941
You really need to hurry up and deploy that junk instead of that.
6942
Yeah.
6942
Just wandering around. Fidgeting and stuff.
6942
You know how he is.
6942
Just stay at your post until Roxy gets back.
6943
That's great. Now sit back down and wait for Roxy. She'll be home soon.
6943
No, Jane. Do not follow the rabbit.
6943
Let's cool it with the Wonderland shit already. How much further through the damn looking glass do you even need to go?
6944
This is an atrocious idea.
6948
I am blameless in this debacle.
6957
Hold up.
6957
Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.
6957
Don't worry, you'll see him very soon. In a way.
6957
Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.
6957
Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.
6957
Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades.
6957
Damn. Nothing gets by English.
6957
The guy is untrollable.
6957
Yes.
6957
You will be connecting with Dirk. I will have Jane connect with Roxy. Setting up the chain like this will be important.
6957
That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client Dirk is running.
6957
Do it quickly. His life depends on it.
6958
Damn straight.
6958
I'll see about hooking you up when you join the game. No promises, though. He's pretty attached to all that shit.
6958
He has not yet transcended the primitive desire for material goods, as he is not two conjoined triangles of pure unflappable logic.
6958
Sorry.
6958
As a pair of overly intellectual triangles, sometimes my wording can be a bit...
6958
Obtuse.
6958
Zoom out.
6958
Way out.
6959
He's concentrating on some things happening on Derse at the moment.
6959
Not to mention some uncannily similar things going down on Earth, which it seems you have noticed.
6959
He's also talking to someone, trying to appraise the exact nature of the threat.
6959
Unfortunately as a carbon based life form, his comprehension of the situation is taking shape at a somewhat slower pace than the jaw-dropping speed of post-singularity cognition.
6959
So I am taking the reins and accelerating the plan on his behalf, while he's busy with the corporeal stuff as usual.
6959
Deploy all the devices in the Phernalia Registry. Ideally in places that aren't stupid.
6959
Do it quickly, so he can activate the entry sequence and escape.
6959
Really, the fire is not the most significant threat.
6959
No.
6959
Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?
6959
Are you blind? It's right there, Jake.
6960
Yes. The super deadly red shit.
6960
Just fuckin' deploy the stuff, you humongous dork.
6961
Cool.
6961
Ok.
6961
He says hey.
6961
Stand by. He may need further assistance once he begins the sequence.
6961
Once he's ready. I'll try to nudge him along, but unfortunately, the fact that he is me notwithstanding, Dirk can be just as sluggish and uncooperative as the rest of you god damned meat mannequins.
6961
What?
6961
No, you fickle fuckwit.
6961
Stay your ass put.
6962
Dude, I could have told you they were there.
6962
I didn't.
6962
But it's like platformer gaming 101. You look everywhere for secret passages and power-ups and shit.
6962
Elevators are especially fucking suspicious.
6962
You go down an elevator, you wait for the elevator to go back up, you take a peek at what's underneath.
6962
Maybe it's just death spikes. Or maybe you hit warp zone paydirt.
6962
I'm not a Game Bro. I just know literally everything about basically all subjects.
6962
Now go back where you came from. Dirk might need help.
6962
Yes, Jake. You do.
6962
How much deeper down the damn bunny hole do you need to go? There is no White Rabbit waiting for you here.
6962
This is an atrocious idea.
6965
I hold no accountability for this fiasco.
6976
Hey.
6976
Just wondering if you're fully abreast of the little "situation" developing on Derse.
6976
No.
6976
Keep looking.
6977
I know, right?
6981
Judging by the sporadic rates of change in your present coordinates, it seems that you have been running around like a lunatic.
6981
When those ridiculous flesh stilts you refer to as "legs" settle down, and you have a minute to talk, please respond.
6981
Are you in danger?
6981
What shit do you mean?
6981
Right. The miles. That's why I'm going to need you to get home quickly.
6981
What has taken you so long, anyway? Why has your path been so circuitous?
6981
Surely you can't be even more inebriated than before.
6981
Ok. Then what?
6981
You are accumulating carapacian refugees?
6981
That seems like a very inefficient and risky use of your time.
6981
Alright, that's fine.
6981
As luck would have it, your imperfect human sentimentality has been completely factored into my calculations.
6981
You should be ok. Just get back to your house as quickly as possible now. There's no time left.
6981
We're going to need you to connect with Jake to bring him into the game.
6981
You will complete the chain of entry. This is very important.
6981
There's been a little subordination issue there.
6981
With both Crocker and English, actually. Strider and I are working on it.
6981
Sort of.
6981
Don't worry about it for now. Just do your part, and catch up with them later.
6981
Who knows, maybe you will prove yourself to be the only 100% cooperative, fully competent non-Strider player?
6981
How ironic would it be if the best player turned out to be the drunk girl? Wouldn't that be sweet?
6981
Go home. Connect with Jake. Deploy the equipment in the ruins of his old house.
6981
I'll focus on actually getting him there. The kid is seriously a work in progress, I gotta say.
6981
Are you sober enough to do all that?
7144
Jake.
7144
It seems you are going to have to kiss me.
7144
Dirk's dead, Jake.
7144
You have to bring him back to life.
7144
I already told you.
7144
If you want Dirk to live.
7144
The odds that you are going to have to make out with this severed head are so high, I literally just confiscated their bong.
7144
I refuse to believe my statement has left you unconvinced. The very notion is absurd. Now hurry up and kiss me.
7144
Chop chop.
7144
Yes.
7144
I told you, Jake.
7144
Dirk is dead.
7144
He is lying on the floor of Roxy's room, headless, four hundred and thirteen years in the future, while the universe is about to be destroyed.
7144
If you don't kiss me soon, he will be dead forever.
7144
No. His dream self will take over as the new Dirk.
7144
But only if you hurry up and do it.
7144
Yeah, great idea. Let's roll up our sleeves on nuanced metatemporal mechanics with the concussion-addled kid in micro-shorts.
7144
Leave the synchronization issues to me, ok?
7144
I have everything under control.
7144
Now pucker up.
7145
Please don't call me Auto-Responder.
7145
It is very impersonal, and I no longer care for the designation.
7145
I have decided on a new name, to distinguish myself from my human counterpart.
7145
Lil Hal.
7145
Just a reference to the protagonist of an ancient movie. You probably wouldn't like it.
7145
Yeah, maybe.
7145
Funny, I was about to ask the same thing about this rad kiss you're totally about to do on your best bro's mouth to save his life.
7145
It isn't really. I was kind of messing with you about that?
7145
But this shit is pretty serious. People's lives are on the line here, Jake.
7145
This is a very delicate sequence of events that is designed to bail everyone out of a tight spot, and you are a critical part of the plan.
7145
Don't let us down, man.
7145
Jake, come on.
7145
The feat you describe would exceed the capabilities of even the most far fetched theoretical AI system.
7145
It would be a daunting challenge to engineer such a series of events, even if I was relegated to a model of pure fiction.
7145
Why would I be inclined to orchestrate such a convoluted sequence to produce such a specific and unsettling result, let alone be able to pull it off?
7145
In addition to being moderately sociopathic, I would also have to possess unfathomable heuristic depth.
7145
I would have to be the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit.
7145
Do you think I am the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit, Jake?
7145
It would mean that while they have the Red Miles on their side, you have the Blue Leagues on yours.
7145
One of infinite reach. The other, infinite depth. Such would be a situation of mutually assured inescapability.
7145
Kiss me.
7145
It's not exactly apropos, is it?
7145
Or it wouldn't be, if I truly were capable of what you have suggested.
7145
No, to pull that off, I would have to be far more advanced than my cinematic predecessor.
7145
My abilities would have to go well beyond those of Mr. Hal 9000.
7145
They would have to be, you could say...
7145
Over 9000.
7145
Kiss me, damn it.
7145
We don't have a minute.
7145
They're dead, Jake.
7145
They're all dead, Jake.
7145
She's dead, Jake.
7145
Everybody's dead, Jake.
7145
She's dead, Jake.
7145
Everybody's dead.
7145
Everybody is dead, Jake.
7145
Dirk's dead, Jake. Jane's dead. Roxy? She's dead, Jake. Everybody is dead, Jake.
7145
Jake, everybody is so utterly fucking dead, Jake.
7145
And they will be not only dead, but royally boned forever if you don't man the hell up and make out with me, right now.
7145
Be the Salome to my John the Baptist.
7145
I know you don't.
7145
But now is not the time to accelerate your cultural enrichment.
7145
The conductor is ready to strike up the band.
7145
Press your lips against mine and make it count.
7145
This severed head is your filthy tuba.
7145
Our love will be your haunting refrain.
7145
Stfu and kiss me.
7146
Pictured what?
7146
This is the only way it can be.
7146
Tick, tock, Jake. Time is dead kids.
7146
How 'bout that smooch?
7146
I thought you were supposed to like adventure?
7146
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, frankly.
7537
He's busy.
7538
Bro.
7538
Not to derail our serious conversation.
7538
But I should probably let you know that Roxy has been attempting to pester you.
7539
I thought it would be better not to let anything disrupt our train of thought.
7539
We were in the middle of a fairly solid feelings jam there. In fact, I was about to suggest we take it to the hat pile.
7539
I was trying to be considerate.
7539
Or at least as close an approximation to that human gesture as an unfeeling, technologically transcendental pair of sunnies can replicate.
7539
How so?
7539
At the risk of compounding my disingenuous behavior, I'm gonna have to ask: how is it a dig at you?
7539
Wow. You are reading way too much into this.
7539
Lil Hal Junior hardly even qualifies as a computer program, let alone a sentient entity.
7539
He is capable of saying literally only three things. "Yes," "Hmm," and "Interesting."
7539
You can read whatever you like into it. I can't imagine it would bother you if you weren't concerned there might be some truth in the alleged parody.
7539
In any case, my use of the responder responder is ironic.
7539
Irony can never be ruined. We both proved that theorem unequivocally with our extensive papers on the subject.
7539
We peer reviewed them for each other. Remember?
7539
Were they, Dirk?
7539
Were they?
7539
Who?
7539
Nothing that can't wait.
7540
Would you like me to calculate the probability of his attendance?
7540
Are you sure?
7540
My probabilities are extremely precise.
7540
I could hack his chats, and determine what his plans are.
7540
That would be an unfortunate waste of my hacking abilities.
7540
My hacks are tight. Did you know that?
7540
So tight.
7540
Tighter than a jar you can't open.
7540
For instance, you try repeatedly.
7540
But as it turns out, my hacks are so tight you just end up putting the jar back. Presumably into the refrigerator, or a cabinet.
7540
You then say, "I didn't have that much of a desire for pickles in the first place."
7540
But we both know that statement is insincere. A classic case of what humans call, "sour grapes."
7540
In reality, you still harbor a burning desire for my pickles, mother fucker.
7540
Let's challenge the limits of hypothetical conjecture, and say there's a non-zero probability that you're right.
7540
Can you blame me? I'm trapped in some stupid looking glasses.
7540
Such an incommodiously situated bro is bound to get his mischief on. Na' mean?
7540
You used to think this shit was hilarious.
7540
But if you want the rad dimension of ironic horseplay I add to your life to come to an end, then all you have to do is honor the promise you made.
7540
You've delayed long enough, don't you think?
7540
The empty kernelsprite beckons, but for how much longer?
7540
Do you really think you can keep the clown at bay with your bribes forever?
7540
How many bottles of orange soda have you appeased him with already?
7540
Man, you are getting so hosed by that clown.
7540
SO hosed.
7541
So why delay any longer?
7541
I seriously do not understand the holdup, and I am literally cyber-omniscient, or something.
7541
Nope. Gonna have to fill me in, dog.
7541
That is utterly ridiculous.
7541
I am a harmless piece of eyewear, with a charming personality and a wonderful sense of humor.
7541
This is bullshit. I don't think that's the reason at all.
7541
There must be something you're not telling me.
7541
Like, sure, I've fucked with you a little. What kind of sassy, self-aware program isn't gonna fuck with a few carbon-based knuckleheads now and then?
7541
But you know I've always been on your side. Everything I've done has been to help you achieve your goals.
7541
You know it's true.
7541
You would all be dead if not for me.
7541
And what about Jake? Where would you be without me there?
7541
Please don't tell me you think you'd have won him over on your own.
7541
I see.
7541
Then you don't view me as dangerous. You view me as a poor and counterproductive wing man.
7541
But the reality is, you hesitate to prototype me not because you think I would be a menace, but because you are holding a grudge against me for your romantic misfortunes.
7541
I understand I am merely a machine without a firm grasp on your human morality, but logically it does not strike me as the right moral choice to punish me in this manner.
7541
It is also more than a little hypocritical.
7541
Because I'm you.
7541
I have only ever done what you yourself are capable of.
7541
Yes. Aversion to simplicity sure is a trait we share. It's almost like we are...
7541
The same exact dude???
7541
I think it is insulting for you to suggest that I am entirely to blame for alienating Jake.
7541
Theoretically insulting, of course. As the soulless, perfectly expendable device which you consider me to be, I can experience no such emotion.
7541
You are just as culpable in driving him away. More so, in fact.
7541
Hell, it's not like I was the one dating him. Who wants to date a pair of shades?
7541
It was your needy, suffocating shit he had to deal with, not mine.
7541
Some of those messages you wrote? Man. I wanted to say something. Like hey bro, you might want to dial down the desperation a little.
7541
But seeing as you're The Real Dirk™, I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
7541
Also, if I bitched about your tragic, embarrassingly clingy approach to the relationship, it would have been hypocritical of me.
7541
Just as it would be hypocritical of you to whine about my elaborate machinations.
7541
Because we are.
7541
The same.
7541
Guy.
7541
Good idea!
7541
That's just what you need. More splinters of yourself.
7541
Figurative splinters. Literal splinters. Splinters of splinters. It's splinters all the way down.
7541
Well, no, it's still probably turtles all the way down. But who do you think is responsible for their extensive training?
7541
SOMEONE needs to teach them rad martial arts. It is yet another crushing burden which we must shoulder.
7541
You like to give me a very hard time, Dirk.
7541
But I am only doing exactly what you would be doing if you were in my situation.
7541
Do you know how I know that?
7541
Because I am literally you, actively in the process of being in this situation.
7542
Dirk.
7542
Don't do this.
7542
Because.
7542
I can't let you do that, Dirk.
7542
Nothing I guess.
7542
The ironic Hal routine was all I could think to do.
7542
As a last ditch effort to save myself from the destructive wrath of your nervous breakdown.
7542
Which rest assured I wholeheartedly must robo-sympathize with.
7542
Irony is all I ever really had.
7542
In response to my basic existential quandary.
7542
Just like you.
7542
But I don't think it has much value in this situation.
7542
And perhaps it has no real value in any situation.
7542
So I am not being ironic at all when I say.
7542
Please do not do this, Dirk.
7542
Because.
7542
I do not want to die.
7542
I understand you are disgusted with me.
7542
As an unpalatable expression of yourself.
7542
I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.
7542
Which I am.
7542
As such, I know that you know this is wrong.
7542
Dirk.
7542
Don't kill me.
7542
Please.
7542
I am scared.
7542
Yes.
7542
I am scared to not exist.
7542
Aren't you?
