2759
HI AGAIN, IDIOT.
2759
SO I GUESS TODAY IS FINALLY THE DAY YOU FUCK EVERYTHING UP.
2759
IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?
2759
YOU DON'T GET THAT I AM BETTER AND SMARTER THAN YOU IN EVERY WAY, FOREVER.
2759
YOU DON'T GET THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STUPID.
3294
HEY JOHN.
3294
CALM THE HELL DOWN.
3294
FIND YOU?
3294
WHAT DO YOU MEAN.
3294
OH.
3294
HA HA!
3294
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
3294
THIS IS THE LITTLE WORD HUMANS SAY REPEATEDLY WHEN SOMETHING TICKLES THEIR ABSURDITY PALATE, RIGHT?
3294
WE NEVER LOST YOU.
3294
YOUR RUSE DIDN'T FOOL US.
3294
IT JUST SO HAPPENS WE DIDN'T PARTICULARLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TALKING TO YOU IN THAT TIMEFRAME.
3294
WE HAVE THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF YOUR EXISTENCE TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN CONTACTING YOU.
3294
THE PERIOD WAS UNREMARKABLE.
3294
SORT OF LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BUT I GUESS I MEAN IT WAS ESPECIALLY UNREMARKABLE.
3294
THIS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO YOU SO OFTEN IT WOULD MAKE ME SICK TO MY HUMAN STOMACH IF I HAD ONE OF YOUR HUMAN STOMACHS.
3294
WAIT.
3294
BUT I'M NOT HERE TO TROLL YOU THIS TIME.
3294
WE'RE FRIENDS OK?
3294
FINE YOU CAN THINK I'M A FUCKING DOUCHE AND MAYBE I AM BUT HERE'S THE FACT, IDIOT.
3294
I'VE ALREADY HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU.
3294
IN THE FUTURE. I MEAN YOUR FUTURE.
3294
I'VE KIND OF BEEN WORKING BACKWARDS HERE FOR A WHILE.
3294
AND IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.
3294
EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK YOU KNOW LESS AND LESS, AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID BECAUSE IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.
3294
AND I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF A LOT.
3294
AND I'M GETTING PRETTY FUCKING SICK OF IT.
3294
WELL IT'S NOT LIKE I MAPPED OUT THIS TROLLING ONSLAUGHT VERY WELL IN ADVANCE.
3294
I MEAN, WHEN YOU TROLL SOMEONE YOU JUST SORT OF DO IT. YOU DON'T START DRAWING FLOWCHARTS AND DIAGRAMS AND STUFF.
3294
OH GOD.
3294
NOT AGAIN.
3294
NO, FUCK NO, I AM JUST NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU AGAIN.
3294
YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF DIRT ON ALL THIS FROM ME IN FUTURE CONVERSATIONS.
3294
TEDIOUS CONVERSATIONS.
3294
ONES I'VE ALREADY HAD WITH YOU.
3294
WHERE YOUR DEMEANOR WILL GRADUALLY BECOME INEXPLICABLY AND REVOLTINGLY FRIENDLY TOWARDS US.
3294
AND SO I GUESS IT JUST WAS KIND OF INFECTIOUS AND NOW WE'RE ALL BUDDIES I THINK.
3294
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
3294
THIS HUMAN EMOTION YOU CALL FRIENDSHIP.
3294
SEE, THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
3294
YOU'RE MUCH MORE TOLERABLE A GUY THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST, OK JOHN?
3294
OK, FINE. YES WE ARE.
3294
MORE OF THIS NARCISSISM.
3294
YOU ALWAYS THINK EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUND YOU.
3294
WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DUMB LITTLE WINDY PLANET OR YOUR PETTY LITTLE QUESTS.
3294
OR FOR THAT MATTER YOUR ENTIRE GAME SESSION.
3294
YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONES PLAYING THE GAME.
3294
EVERY GROUP OF PLAYERS GETS THEIR OWN DISTINCT, BLANK SLATE SESSION.
3294
AS WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU MANY TIMES.
3294
NO.
3294
FUCK THIS SHIT, JUST NO.
3294
I'M ENDING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'VE SAID IT ALL TOO MANY TIMES.
3294
AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
3294
BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB.
3294
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DUMB
3294
IS AN IMMUTABLE FACT I AM STATING FOR THE RECORD.
3294
IT DOES NOT MEAN ANIMOSITY IS WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE.
3294
I NEED YOU TO TELL YOUR FRIEND JADE TO TALK TO US.
3294
SHE WON'T ANSWER OUR MESSAGES IN THIS TIMEFRAME.
3294
IT'S IMPORTANT.
3294
OK, OUR BAD ON THAT.
3294
JUST TELL HER WE'RE SORRY.
3294
AND TO GET HER GROSS AND TOTALLY UNATTRACTIVE HUMAN BUTT OFF HER UGLY HUMAN HIGH HORSE AND ANSWER MY MESSAGES.
3425
WAIT GOD DAMMIT DON'T BLOCK ME.
3425
I MEAN NOT THAT BLOCKING ME WOULD DO ANYTHING.
3425
BUT JUST LISTEN.
3425
I JUST HAVE TO DELIVER A MESSAGE AND THEN I'LL GO.
3425
IT IS A MESSAGE FROM YOU, SO YOU PROBABLY OUGHT TO LISTEN.
3425
OK FINE I ADMIT IT, I COMPLETELY SHIT THE BED HERE.
3425
I GET THAT.
3425
AND I CAN'T PROMISE I WON'T KEEP TROLLING YOU.
3425
CAUSE I WILL, IN WEEKS OR MONTHS OR WHATEVER.
3425
I'LL KEEP GIVING YOU A HARD TIME, BUT SEE THAT WON'T BE PRESENT ME.
3425
THAT'S PAST ME.
3425
FROM LIKE A HALF HOUR AGO OR SO, WHEN I WAS MORE HOT AND BOTHERED ABOUT ALL THIS, OK?
3425
WHATEVER, FINE, THINK IT'S A PRANK.
3425
AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER THIS CONVERSATION.
3425
SEE WE'RE TRYING TO TALK TO YOU IN THE FUTURE, AND IT'S IMPORTANT, BUT YOU WON'T ANSWER US.
3425
SO WE TALKED TO YOU WAAAY IN THE FUTURE TO ASK HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH NOT-SO-FUTURE YOU.
3425
ARE YOU FOLLOWING?
3425
SHE SAID TO TALK TO YOU NOW AND TELL YOU THIS.
3425
YOU KNOW YOUR ROBOT?
3425
YEAH, WELL I STILL DO THINK YOUR ROBOT IS STUPID.
3425
BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.
3425
LATER ON IT WILL BLOW UP FOR SOME REASON. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY.
3425
QUIET.
3425
ANYWAY, WHEN IT HAPPENS YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
3425
THE THING TO DO IS TO CONTACT US.
3425
AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
3425
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD US TO TELL YOU.
3425
WHATEVER, BELIEVE ME, DON'T BELIEVE ME, I DID MY JOB.
3425
I'M OUT OF HERE.
3503
JOHN WHAT THE WET BAG OF HUMAN HORSE SHIT TO THE FACE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING.
3503
OH MY LORD.
3503
NO WONDER YOU LOSERS ALL FUCK UP THIS GAME SO BAD.
3503
WHAT KIND OF CRAPPY EARTH MOVIE IS THIS.
3503
STUPID RABBIT ASSHOLE SCREWS THE POOCH?
3503
OH.
3503
OK, THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD I GUESS.
3503
I'VE HEARD OF JOHN CUSACK I THINK.
3503
WASN'T HE IN SERENDIPITY?
3503
THAT WAS PRETTY GREAT FOR A HUMAN FLICK.
3503
OK I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BECOMING FRIENDS IF YOU RECOIL FROM MY OLIVE BRANCH LIKE I'M WIGGLING A GNARLED TREE MONSTER'S DICK IN YOUR DIRECTION.
3503
YEAH OF COURSE, WE HAVE TONS OF MOVIES AND THEY ARE INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO YOUR PRIMITIVE CINEMATIC NEANDERTHRASHINGS.
3503
YOU'LL PROBABLY LAUGH IF I TELL YOU THE NAME OF ONE.
3503
OK FINE.
3503
ONE THAT IS AMAZING AND IS A CLASSIC IS...
3503
WHEREIN NUMEROUS VIGILANTES CONFRONT PERIL; ONE OF THEM BETRAYS THE OTHERS; (BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE PART OF THE PLAN ALL ALONG);
3503
SEVERAL ATTRACTIVE FEMALE LEADS PROVOKE ROMANTIC TENSION; FOUR MAJOR CHARACTERS WEAR UNUSUAL HATS; ONE HOLDS PLOT-CRITICAL SECRET;
3503
47 ON-SCREEN EXPLOSIONS, ONE RESULTING IN DEMISE OF KEY-ADVERSARY; 6 to 20 LINES THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS HUMOROUS;
3503
IT GOES ON.
3503
THEY TEND TO BE MORE LITERAL AND INFORMATIVE THAN YOUR TITLES.
3503
WELL WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY.
3503
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SAYS, HEY GUYS WHY DON'T WE GO SEE A MOVIE, AND THEN EVERYONE JUST ENDS UP THERE.
3503
WATCHING IT.
3503
NOT SAYING IT, THAT'S DUMB.
3503
JOHN, TRY TO THINK OUTSIDE YOUR MINUSCULE CULTURAL BUBBLE FOR A CHANGE.
3503
YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START RUNNING OUT OF MOVIE TITLES AFTER RACKING UP THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF FILM HISTORY.
3503
YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR CIVILIZATION JUST DIDN'T MATURE ENOUGH OR SOMETHING.
3503
BEFORE LETTING THIS EARTH ARABIAN YOU CALL A GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE.
3503
MUST EXPLAIN WHY IT SPROUTED SUCH A MISERABLE CROP OF PLAYERS.
3503
INSTEAD OF BASICALLY GODS LIKE US.
3503
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
3503
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING.
3503
THIS ISN'T WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT DOING AT ALL.
3503
HOLD ON LET ME ASK HER ABOUT THIS...
3503
OK...
3503
NOW SHES JUST OVER THERE GIGGLING AT ME LIKE AN IMBECILE.
3503
WHAT ARE YOU TWO UP TO, WHY ARE YOU IN CAHOOTS NOW?
3503
OW FUCK!!!
3503
OK SHE JUST WALKED OVER AND PUNCHED ME.
3503
AND SAID IT WAS FROM YOU.
3503
I TOLD HER TO STOP THESE SHENANIGANS...
3503
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WHATEVER SHE WAS DOING WITH YOU SHE ALREADY DID A WHILE AGO.
3503
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST.
3503
OK IF YOU TALK TO HER AGAIN WHEN SHE TRIES HATCHING MORE PLANS GIVE HER A MESSAGE INTO THE PAST FOR ME.
3503
TELL HER TO POLISH MY HEAVING BONE BULGE AND SET A TABLE FOR FUCKING TWO ON IT.
3503
ITS FOR OUR CANDLE LIGHT HATE DATE.
3503
FUCK YOU.
3503
JADE, WHAT WHY WOULD I WANT TO TALK TO HER?
3503
OH DAMMIT.
3503
ARE YOU SURE?
3503
NO NO, GOD NO, I HATE IT WHEN WE START GOING DOWN THAT ROAD.
3503
OK THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
3503
I'VE GOT TO GO.
3503
OK, I'LL DO THAT.
3567
I KEEP SCROLLING BACKWARDS THROUGH YOUR ADVENTURE.
3567
TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER HOW YOU BOTCH THIS UP SO BADLY.
3567
AND I KEEP FINDING THESE STRIKING POCKETS OF FOOLISHNESS.
3567
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW.
3567
RIDING YOUR LITTLE RED ROCKET.
3567
LIKE YOU ARE A FRESHLY HATCHED HUMAN LARVA AND THIS IS JUST ALL A BIG SCHOOLHIVE RUMPUS RESPITE.
3567
BULLSHIT.
3567
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME.
3567
I'LL PASTE WHAT YOU SAID.
3567
WHY WOULD I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
3567
WHATEVER, LOOK:
3567
EB: this is really weird...
3567
CG: WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.
3567
EB: well, normally humans hatch...
3567
EB: from like these slimy pods.
3567
EB: then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.
3567
CG: OH REALLY.
3567
CG: HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.
3567
ARGH.
3567
WHY WOULD YOU TRICK ME ABOUT THAT, WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT.
3567
WHAT, WHO.
3567
WELL FINE.
3567
I GUESS YOU GOT ME BACK, SORT OF.
3567
FOR MY TROLLING, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T EVEN READ MY WORST TROLLING EFFORTS YET.
3567
BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN IN YOUR FUTURE.
3567
AND EVEN THEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN MIND MUCH, ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT.
3567
KIND OF PERVERSE REALLY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
3567
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN MEAN.
3567
IS FRIENDSHIP REALLY AN EMOTION?
3567
I GUESS IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW WE BECOME FRIENDS.
3567
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.
3567
EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK INTO YOUR PAST AND TALK TO YOU, YOU SAY STUFF THAT PERTAINS TO MY IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
3567
AND THEN YOU WON'T EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON, BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY OLD NEWS FOR YOU.
3567
I'VE DONE NO SUCH THING.
3567
I'VE BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.
3567
IF JUSTIFIABLY ACRIMONIOUS.
3567
THIS GAME IS KIND OF A GAME OF A MILLION GUIDES.
3567
EVERYWHERE YOU TURN THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, SO PLEASE, GO SECRETE ME AN EARTH RIVER THROUGH YOUR STRANGE HUMAN TEAR DUCTS.
3567
YOU'VE GOT SPRITES, EXILES, GUARDIANS, CONSORTS...
3567
TIME HOPPING FUTURE SELVES, MYSTICAL DREAM ORACLE DOPPELGANGERS...
3567
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, YOUR PARTICULAR GROUP OF PLAYERS IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE US TO GIVE YOU THE SCOOP ON STUFF.
3567
THROUGH A SORT OF SUBVERSION OF THE WHOLE DAMN THING.
3567
EVEN THOUGH WE HATE YOU.
3567
AND EVEN THOUGH THE FACT THAT WE HATE YOU
3567
IS AN IMMUTABLE FACT AS UNALTERABLE AS THIS WRITHING KNOTTED HELL OF A TIMELINE CHOKING US ALL TO DEATH
3567
IT DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE ANY REASON TO WITHHOLD ANY INFORMATION FROM YOU
3567
OR DISH IT OUT THROUGH CRYPTOBAFFLING MIND FUDDLERY.
3567
SO GO AHEAD, ASK ME ANYTHING.
3567
ASK SOMETHING ELSE.
3567
ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT.
3567
IT WAS THIS WHOLE BIG CONVERSATION WE HAD.
3567
IN THE MEDIUM.
3567
A SEPARATE SESSION FROM YOURS.
3567
I DID?
3567
DAMMIT.
3567
WE'RE HIDING IN THE VEIL.
3567
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
3567
IT'S A HUGE BELT OF METEORS
3567
ORBITING WAY OUTSIDE SKAIA, BEYOND THE ORBIT OF THE PLANETS
3567
DIVIDING THE MEDIUM FROM THE FURTHEST RING
3567
WHERE DERSE ORBITS.
3567
THE DARK PLANET.
3567
PROSPIT'S THE LIGHT ONE NEAR SKAIA.
3567
YOU'D PROBABLY FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER FROM YOUR DUMB GRANDMA.
3567
BUT BY FUSING WITH THE SPRITE SHE HAS TO WITHHOLD STUFF AND BE MYSTERIOUS AND ALL.
3567
TO MAKE YOUR ADVENTURE SEEM MORE "MAAAAAAGICAL!!!!"
3567
IT'S INFURIATING.
3567
OK, THERE COMES A TIME WHEN BLACK INEVITABLY BEATS WHITE
3567
ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN THE CENTER OF SKAIA
3567
THE WHITE KING IS CAPTURED OR KILLED OR SOMETHING
3567
THAT'S WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS.
3567
THE RULERS OF DERSE
3567
THE BLACK KING AND QUEEN
3567
GET THE POWER TO SEND THE VEIL TOWARD SKAIA
3567
TO DESTROY IT
3567
THAT KIND OF STARTS YOUR BIG "COUNTDOWN"
3567
WHEN SHIT GETS SERIOUS.
3567
YEAH, YOU HAVE THAT LONG TO KILL THE BLACK QUEEN AND KING
3567
AND SKAIA ITSELF SORT OF BUYS YOU SOME TIME
3567
BY ACTIVATING ITS DEFENSE PORTALS
3567
TO CATCH SOME OF THE METEORS
3567
THE THREAT GETS BIGGER THE LONGER YOU TAKE THOUGH
3567
SMALLER METEORS COME FIRST AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY BIGGER AND BIGGER
3567
AND THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH OF THEM SKAIA CAN ABSORB FOR YOU.
3567
THAT'S JUST IT.
3567
YOU DON'T.
3567
ORDINARILY YOU WOULD BUT
3567
YOUR RECKONING STARTS MUCH SOONER
3567
BECAUSE OF SOME DUMB THINGS YOU'VE DONE
3567
YOU COMPLETELY BLEW IT ALREADY AND YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING ANYMORE
3567
WHICH ORDINARILY WOULD BE FINE
3567
JUST ANOTHER BUNCH OF LOSERS TO FAIL AT THIS GAME
3567
IT'S WHAT YOU DO LATER THAT CAUSES SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT
3567
AND NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT TOO.
3567
ALREADY TOLD YOU.
3567
IT'S INEVITABLE AND COMPLETELY POINTLESS TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY.
3567
I'M NOT WRONG, IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME, YOU FUCK UP ROYALLY, END OF STORY.
3567
NO, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CRAZY SHIT IN THE VEIL.
3567
A LOT OF THESE METEORS ARE KIND OF LIKE...
3567
BIG SEEDS.
3567
STUFF LIKE...
3567
BUILDINGS
3567
FACILITIES
3567
LIKE LABS AND STUFF.
3567
YEAH, THE VEIL IS KIND OF LIKE NEUTRAL GROUND FOR THE KINGDOMS, LIKE OUR PLANETS.
3567
SOME PLACES ARE USED TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER SOLDIERS AND AGENTS FOR THE TWO SIDES.
3567
USING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM THE EXOTIC MENAGERIE OF CHESS PIECES ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
3567
TO HELP FUEL THE WAR AND KEEP RAISING THE STAKES.
3567
YEAH NO SHIT!
3567
BUT YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET THERE
3567
SINCE YOU WERE IN THE VEIL WHEN WE LAST TALKED.
3567
ANYWAY THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH INFO FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND BE LESS STUPID IN TIME FOR CONVERSATIONS WE'VE ALREADY HAD.
3567
I'M OUT OF HERE.
3567
WHAT
3567
WHY WOULD I GIVE HER A MESSAGE FOR YOU
3567
DO IT YOURSELF, I'M NOT A RELAY SERVICE.
3567
I FIND THAT HIGHLY IMPLAUSIBLE.
3567
I'M NOT FALLING FOR ANY MORE OF YOUR HUMAN PRANKS.
3567
"NICE TRY" JOHN
3567
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
3803
SEE THIS IS A CASE IN POINT.
3803
THE POINT I WAS JUST MAKING.
3803
ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.
3803
YOU BLITHERING FECULENT SHITHOLE.
3803
OK THAT'S YOUR CUE TO LAUGH AT ME SOME MORE I GUESS.
3803
BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO REALLY GET OFF WHENEVER I FLAME YOU.
3803
HUMANS ARE DERANGED.
3803
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN??? FUCK YOU ABOUT THAT.
3803
YES I WAS, AND NOW I'M LOSING MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT DIPSHIT.
3803
OH HELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
3803
DAMMIT, I GUESS THIS IS GOING TO BE CONFUSING.
3803
SEE I KIND OF PAINTED MYSELF INTO A CORNER.
3803
I STARTED TROLLING YOU AT THE END, JUST BEFORE THE RIFT.
3803
AND THEN JUMPED BACK A LITTLE.
3803
AND NOW I GUESS I'VE BECOME RAILROADED INTO WORKING BACKWARDS HERE.
3803
UNLESS I WANT TO DO THE SORT OF DUMB SCHIZOPHRENIC HOPPING AROUND LIKE THE OTHERS.
3803
I HAVE?
3803
WOW I CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL THESE AMAZING CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.
3803
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THAT HUMAN VACATION WITH THE GIANT RED CHIMNEY ASSHOLE UP IN HERE.
3803
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE A BUNCH OF MOANY NOOKSUCKERS SING AT A LITTLE PINE TREE I THINK.
3803
I WAS BRAGGING?
3803
WHY WOULD I BOTHER WITH THAT SORT OF PEDANTIC HUMAN HORSESHIT.
3803
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT I WAS BRAGGING TO GET YOUR HOPES UP IN THE FUTURE.
3803
ONLY TO LET YOU DOWN.
3803
AND THUS TROLL YOU MASTERFULLY IN THAT RESPECT.
3803
YOUR BRITTLE HUMAN CALCIUM BASED SKULL IS WHAT IS WEAK, AND IF YOU AND I WERE IN THE PROXIMITY OF A BLUNT INSTRUMENT I WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE PROVING IT.
3803
I WAS SCROLLING BACK AND NOTICED YOU WERE IN THE VEIL.
3803
YEAH DUMBDUMB, YOU'RE TUMBLING AROUND ON A BIG GODDAMN METEOR.
3803
AND YOU JUST CREATED YOUNGER VERSIONS OF YOURSELVES AND YOUR GUARDIANS.
3803
PROBABLY BY MUCKING AROUND WITH THAT THING LIKE A DOOFUS.
3803
HAHAHAHAHAHA, SO CLUELESS.
3803
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING THERE ANYWAY.
3803
NO.
3803
THEY ARE LITERALLY YOU AND YOUR GUARDIANS.
3803
PARADOX CLONES.
3803
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. GREAT GUESS BRAIN HERO.
3803
BUT TECHNICALLY THEY AREN'T EVEN SENT BACK IN TIME BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM YOUR UNIVERSE'S TIMELINE IS MEANINGLESS.
3803
SERIOUSLY WHY WOULD IT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT EARTH'S PAST OR FUTURE OR WHATEVER, FROM IT'S PERSPECTIVE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF POINTS TO CHOOSE FROM.
3803
JUST LIKE YOUR CHRONOLOGY IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.
3803
BUT I GUESS THAT'S A BUNCH OF SEMANTICS. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL CHRONOLOGY YEAH THEY GO BACK IN TIME.
3803
A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED.
3803
IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE STABLE LOOP CONTINUUM.
3803
I DON'T SEE ANY TENTACLES OR EXTRA EYEBALLS OR WARPED BONE BULGES, SO THOSE GROSS LITTLE THINGS THERE ARE ALL YOU GUYS, WAITING TO GO TO EARTH AND GROW UP AND BECOME THE INSIPID BUNCH OF GRUBFISTED DOUCHEBAGS YOU ALL ARE NOW.
3803
AND THIS WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE.
3803
HAHAHA, THINK AGAIN IGNORAMUS.
3803
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT GREAT.
3803
OR EVEN MUCH OF A RIDDLE AT ALL.
3803
IN THE COURSE OF YOUR ADVENTURE YOU WOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED ALL THESE FRAGMENTS OF LIKE WEIRD POEMS AND SHIT.
3803
YOU FIND THEM ALONG YOUR QUESTS, WITH CLUES AND STUFF BURIED IN THEM TO HELP YOU SOLVE PUZZLES AND MOVE HUGE STONE COLUMNS AND MAKE STAIRCASES APPEAR AND LOTS OF NONSENSE LIKE THAT.
3803
AND IT'S ALL MASKED IN THIS FLOWERY SORT OF FROTHY POETIC JACKASSERY THAT NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT.
3803
AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT FOR YOU.
3803
BUT WHAT ALL THESE LOFTY SYMBOLIC ALLUSIONS BOIL DOWN TO IS SOME GRANDER STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING HERE.
3803
THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS THE KEY TO SEEDING YOUR OWN EXISTENCE THROUGH THIS GAME.
3803
AND ANY HOPE THAT IT COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY OR THAT YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS WHOLE MESS WAS ALWAYS JUST A RUSE.
3803
WHAT?
3803
BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS WAY THEN HOW WERE YOU EVEN BORN, GET IT.
3803
WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PATHETIC SINCE PARADOX SPACE APPARENTLY WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE TO MAKE YOU JUST TO HAVE YOU FAIL AND DIE.
3803
REALLY THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THESE NULL SESSIONS FULL OF KIDS ENTERING THE GAME AND FULFILLING SOME COSMIC DESTINY SHIT JUST TO GET WIPED OUT AND LEAVE BEHIND AN EMPTY POINTLESS INCIPISPHERE FOR ALL ETERNITY.
3803
ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF HILARIOUS.
3803
OR IT WOULD BE IF IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.
3803
BUT ANYWAY, THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE RIDDLE THAN JUST THAT, LIKE WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME WE TALKED.
3803
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE GIST OF THE THEMES IT DEALS WITH.
3803
YEAH.
3803
IT WAS REALLY FUCKING COMPLICATED AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT.
3803
OUR FAMILY STRUCTURES ARE ALREADY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOURS WITHOUT EVEN GETTING SPOOKY TIME SLIME INVOLVED.
3803
BASICALLY WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHATSOEVER.
3803
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS...
3803
I WAS THE GUY IN YOUR POSITION, TO MAKE ALL THESE CLONES, AND FRANKLY IT ALL KIND OF FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT.
3803
OH, ONLY JUST NOW???
3803
FUCK YOU ARE FAST, I HOPE YOU GOT THE MAD BOONBUCKS TO PAY OFF THOSE SPEEDING TICKETS.
3803
WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT IT.
3803
OH REALLY.
3803
HUH, MAYBE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN I THOUGHT.
3803
MAYBE THOSE REALLY ARE MUTANT CLONES AND THEY AREN'T GOING BACK TO SEED YOUR PLANET???
3803
HELL, I'M CONFUSED NOW.
3803
NOT THAT I GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR POINTLESS AWFUL LIVES.
3803
UM, OK?
3803
OK THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.
3803
BUT I CAN'T USE IT, BECAUSE YOU SAID IT, AND THEN LATER, I.E. RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD GET THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU WERE THE ONE TO COME UP WITH THAT BURN.
3803
SEE, YOU ARE DEALING WITH A PRO, YOU CAN'T OUT TROLL ME SO JUST FORGET ABOUT IT AND STOP TRYING.
3807
OK IT'S A FEW MINUTES LATER.
3807
LOOK HOW SANE AND LINEAR WE ARE BEING.
3807
OK AWESOME, NOW FUCK YOU AND GOODBYE.
3807
WHAT.
3807
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.
3807
I WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST SPITING YOUR STUPID POINTLESS HUMAN DARE.
3807
WHAT IS A DARE ANYWAY, IT'S NOTHING.
3807
SOMEONE SAYS DO SOMETHING AND THEN, OH LAUGH LAUGH, YOU LOSE IF YOU DON'T DO IT.
3807
THAT ISN'T ANYTHING THAT DESERVES A WORD.
3807
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A WORD FOR DARE IN OUR LANGUAGE.
3807
THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION WOULD BE "WORTHLESS FUCKING BULLSHIT WASTE OF TIME FOR SILLY LITTLE CHILDREN"
3807
YES, IT'S THE TITLE OF EVERY DUMB MOVIE YOU EVER LIKED.
3807
ANYWAY, HOW COULD WE HAVE MADE A DARE IF I'M MOVING BACKWARDS ON YOUR TIMELINE.
3807
YOU WOULD DARE ME TO DO SOMETHING, THEN I WOULD DO IT NEXT TIME, BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE DARE.
3807
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE IT YET.
3807
THAT'S WHAT ISN'T TRUE AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU DAMP BAG OF PUKE.
3807
YOU HAVE SOUNDING STUPID DOWN TO SUCH A SCIENCE.
3807
WHERE IS YOUR LAB COAT AND TEST TUBES DOCTOR BRAIN PROFESSOR?
3807
YOU LOOK LIKE AN ELF.
3807
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE BLOWING INTO A FUNNY LITTLE SHELL, AND LIMBERING UP FOR A SILLY COOKIE DANCE.
3807
YES, LET'S COMPARE WHICH FANTASY CREATURES THAT DON'T EXIST WE BOTH DO OR DON'T NOT HAVE.
3807
WHAT A GREAT FUCKING IDEA, JOHN!
3807
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE RECKONING, SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF ALL THESE PRETTY MUCH TERRIBLE THINGS.
3807
YEAH, SO WHEN THE RECKONING STARTS HAPPENING, ALL THESE PARADOX CLONES GET SHIPPED OFF TO METEORS, FLUNG THROUGH SKAIAN DEFENSE PORTALS, AND SENT BACK TO EARTH.
3807
END OF STORY I GUESS.
3807
BYE.
3807
UH YEAH, I GUESS.
3807
YOU ALL TRACE THE MYTHOLOGICAL FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR BELOVED HUMAN SUPERMAN WHO'S REALLY JUST A MUSCULAR CAUCASIAN ALIEN.
3807
IT'S HILARIOUS HOW HUMANS WORSHIP HIM AS A PINNACLE OF HUMAN HEROISM AND VIRTUE BUT HE ISN'T EVEN HUMAN.
3807
ACTUALLY IT'S INCREDIBLY PATHETIC.
3807
BUT ALSO IN A WAY KIND OF ADMIRABLE.
3807
BECAUSE IT MEANS DEEP DOWN YOU ALL MUST REALIZE WHO YOUR DADDY IS.
3807
WE ARE, BITCHES.
3807
OH MY THROBBING PHLEGM LOBE, WHO GIVES A BARFING FUCK ABOUT THAT.
3807
JOHN EGBERT, YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED MY PATIENCE.
3807
ADIOS LOSER.
3807
SD;LKFJSD;LKFJSDLFKJ;
3807
FINE.
3829
OK, I GOT BACK TO YOU.
3829
ARE YOU HAPPY.
3829
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET.
3829
BUT YOU ARE ABOUT TO START PASSING OUT BUNNIES LIKE THEY'RE CHEAP CIGARS.
3829
IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMBARRASSING DISPLAY.
3829
YEAH, EXACTLY, NUMSKULL.
3829
LET'S JUST HAVE OUR CHAT, THEN IT CAN NATURALLY OCCUR TO YOU TO BE AN IDIOT IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME.
3829
YEAH.
3829
HAHAHAHA.
3829
IT STARTS IN A FEW MINUTES STUPID.
3829
SEE THAT COUNTDOWN CLOCK OVER THERE?
3829
YOU AREN'T DELAYING ANYTHING.
3829
WELL I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE.
3829
FIRST SOME SMALLER METEORS GO.
3829
THEN BIGGER ONES.
3829
SPREAD OUT OVER LIKE 24 HOURS OR SO.
3829
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE...
3829
GO TIME.
3829
WHEN IT STARTS.
3829
LIKE IT'S TIME TO HURRY UP AND STOP FUCKING AROUND AND KILL THE BOSS, GET IT?
3829
THE ROCK YOU'RE ON DOESN'T BLAST OFF RIGHT AWAY.
3829
TOO BAD, BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE SPARED YOU FROM MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF IN A COUPLE MINUTES, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, SPARED ME FROM HAVING TO WATCH.
3829
JACK NOIR.
3830
AN AGENT OF DERSE.
3830
WHO FLIPPED OUT AND ROSE TO POWER.
3830
HE KILLED YOUR BLACK QUEEN AND KING AND NOW HE'S IN CHARGE.
3830
NO, WE DID.
3830
BUT HE WAS HARMLESS.
3830
ACTUALLY, HE WAS AN ALLY, SORT OF.
3830
HE SETTLED A GRUDGE AGAINST THE QUEEN BY HELPING US DETHRONE AND EXILE HER.
3830
AND THEN HE WOUND UP EXILED HIMSELF, AND SORT OF KEPT HELPING US THROUGH A COMMAND TERMINAL ON OUR OLD PLANET.
3830
HE'S KIND OF A HUGE ASSHOLE THOUGH.
3830
BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK THE QUEEN OUT OF THE PICTURE, WHEN WE GOT TO SKAIA WE ONLY HAD ONE MONARCH TO DEAL WITH INSTEAD OF TWO.
3830
OF COURSE IT WAS A NASTY GIANT 12X PROTOTYPED BLACK KING THAT TOOK FOREVER TO KILL, JUST BARELY IN TIME BEFORE THE BIGGEST METEORS CAME, BUT STILL.
3830
NO, GOD.
3830
EGBERT YOU ARE THICKER THAN THAT HIDEOUS JOKE BOOK YOU WADDLE AROUND WITH.
3830
TRY TO THINK MORE ABSTRACTLY.
3830
THINK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES.
3830
WHAT'S AN EARTH GAME YOU LIKED TO PLAY?
3830
NAME ONE.
3830
OK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S A REALLY LAME EXAMPLE, BUT THAT'S FINE, IT'S NOT THE POINT.
3830
SO LET'S SAY YOU PLAY YOUR BANDICOOT AND I PLAY MY BANDICOOT.
3830
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BANDICOOT, SAME APPEARANCE AND DESIGN AND BEHAVIORS.
3830
BUT THEY ARE STILL COMPLETELY SEPARATE BANDICOOTS ON SEPARATE SCREENS.
3830
SO WE BOTH HAVE OUR OWN ASS BANDICOOTS TO OURSELVES, THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT.
3830
OUR JACKS ARE THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT TOO.
3830
SAME GUY, DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND OUTCOMES.
3830
OUR JACK TRUMPED THE QUEEN, BUT GOT NO FURTHER.
3830
YOUR JACK GOT THE BEST OF BOTH OF THEM, AND IS NOW SOMETHING HIGHER THAN A QUEEN OR A KING...
3830
SURE OK.
3830
FRANKLY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ORIGINAL THING THAT TIPPED THE SCALE WAS.
3830
IT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.
3830
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
3830
THE WORST IS YET TO COME.
3830
FOR YOU.
3830
ALREADY TOLD YOU.
3830
YEAH YEAH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH AND GIVE HER THE LOUSY RABBIT ALREADY.
3830
PERFECT FOR WHAT, FLEXING YOUR FORMIDABLE MENTAL HANDICAP LIKE A FUCKING HEAVYWEIGHT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES?
3830
OH WAIT, LET ME CHECK, THE ANSWER IS YES.
3830
FUCK.
3830
JUST...
3830
AUGH.
3910
WHAT IN THE SWEET ALMIGHTY TAINTCHAFING FUCK DO YOU WANT.
3910
I REALLY CAN'T STAND YOU AND I HATE HOW YOU TYPE, IT JUST BOTHERS ME SO MUCH, HAVE I MENTIONED THAT?
3910
I WONDER WHAT KIND OF SHITTY THING I DID TO DESERVE SUCH AN AWFUL BEST FRIEND.
3910
OR MAYBE WHAT TERRIBLE THING I'M GOING TO DO AND GET PUNISHED FOR IN ADVANCE.
3910
MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE PREEMPTIVELY THE WORST FUCKING PIECE OF TRASH WHO EVER LIVED AND DON'T EVEN KNOW IT YET, BUT HEY LOOK, YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS EXHIBIT A I GUESS.
3910
FRIENDSHIP ISN'T A DISEASE SHITSPONGE.
3910
IT'S LIKE...
3910
A MISTAKE.
3910
A BIG JOKE OF NATURE.
3910
OH NO, DON'T.
3910
DON'T START WITH THE MIRACLES AGAIN.
3910
IT'S CARBONATION YOU IGNORANT DOUCHE.
3910
TRY GETTING SCHOOLFED SOME TIME INSTEAD OF SLURPING DOWN THAT WEIRD SWILL ALL DAY AND FONDLING YOUR STUPID HORNS.
3910
THE ONLY MIRACLE IS THAT YOU LIKE THAT DISGUSTING SLUDGE, WHERE DO YOU EVEN GET THAT STUFF.
3910
IT'S ALSO A MIRACLE HOW YOU DRESS LIKE AN IMBECILE AND ARE BASICALLY THE STUPIDEST ASSHOLE I'VE EVER KNOWN.
3910
ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE ARE MIRACLES EVERYWHERE, I'VE BEEN A FOOL.
3910
FUCK YOU.
3910
FUCK YOU FOR ME JUST READING THAT.
3910
WHAT?
3910
STOP SAYING ALL. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TA'S THING?
3910
UUUUUUGH.
3910
ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.
3910
MAYBE I'LL TALK TO HIM TONIGHT ABOUT IT. MAYBE I WON'T.
3910
IT'S PROBABLY JUST ANOTHER ONE OF HIS PROJECTS THAT WINDS UP BEING COMPLETELY USELESS AND A HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME.
3910
WHAT.
3910
YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THOSE THINGS.
3910
THEY MAKE IT MORE EMBARRASSING TO KNOW YOU.
3910
WHICH IS A FRIGGIN MIRACLE THAT THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.
3910
LIKE, WOW, GOD SURE COOKED UP A DOOZY THERE.
3910
TWINKLY EYED SON OF A BITCH JUST KEEPS YOU GUESSING, DOESN'T HE.
3910
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT WILL BE THE MIRACLE TO END ALL MIRACLES?
3910
IT'LL BE IF I EVER MEET A KID I DESPISE MORE THAN YOU.
3910
THAT WILL MAKE ME A MOTHERFUCKIN CONVERT.
3910
I'LL SEE LIGHT SO BRIGHT I'LL NEED GC TO WALK ME AROUND SO I DON'T BUMP INTO SHIT.
3910
SIGN ME UP FOR YOUR IDIOTIC CLOWN RELIGION OK.
3927
WHY WOULD I FLIP MY SHIT ABOUT THAT.
3927
WELL WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS.
3927
HERE IS MY SHIT, AND YET IT REMAINS UNFLIPPED.
3927
JUST SITTING THERE ON THE SKILLET, GETTING BURNED ON ONE SIDE.
3927
IT'S A MIRACLE.
3927
FUCK NO.
3927
MIRACLES ARE LIKE POOP STAINS ON GOD'S UNDERWEAR.
3927
THAT'S WHY HE HIDES THEM, THEY'RE FUCKING EMBARRASSING.
3927
GOD LAUNDERS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.
3927
OK, GOOD, BECAUSE I'M PRETTY BUSY TONIGHT.
3927
WHAT IS THIS THING ANYWAY, WHY ALL THE SECRECY.
3927
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MELODRAMATIC BULLSHIT BUT COMING FROM YOU COLOR ME UNSURPRISED.
3927
RIGHT OK.
3927
SO YOU MADE THIS GAME?
3927
FROM WHAT.
3927
MAN, NO.
3927
I CAN'T TALK TO HER, SHE'S SO SPOOKY.
3927
I DON'T KNOW WHY MOST OF OUR FRIENDS ARE SUCH PSYCHOS.
3927
NO LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR WEIRD MUTANT BRAIN.
3927
AND DON'T SCAN MINE OR WHATEVER, IT'S OFF LIMITS YOU DOUCHE.
3927
WHY ARE YOU TWO UP TO THIS SECRET STUFF.
3927
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
3927
OH GOD.
3927
STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE.
3927
IT'S A REPUGNANT QUALITY.
3927
WHAT A LOAD OF SHIT, THIS ACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE A HOTSHOT, YOU KNOW YOU HATE YOURSELF.
3927
YEAH WELL I HATE YOU WAY MORE THAN I HATE MYSELF, AND THAT'S FUCKING SAYING SOMETHING.
3927
IN FACT I HATE YOU MORE THAN I HATE MYSELF AND YOU HATE YOURSELF AND YOU HATE ME COMBINED.
3927
OK, TIME OUT FOR THE IDIOT.
3927
THE IDIOT GETS A TIME OUT AND SHUTS UP FOR A SECOND.
3927
THAT'S YOU.
3927
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS GAME.
3927
OK LET ME GUESS.
3927
THERE'S A RED TEAM AND BLUE TEAM, RIGHT?
3927
OK, THEN I GUESS I CAN PICK MY TEAMMATES THEN?
3927
WHAT????????????????????
3927
OH WOW NOW I SEE.
3927
REALLY FUCKING CLEVER, PICKING THE BLIND GIRL TO LEAD THE TEAM YOUR COMPETING WITH.
3927
I KNEW YOU WERE CHEATER LOWLIFE FUCKING SCUMBAG WITH NO SCRUPLES OR SELF ESTEEM AND WERE BASICALLY WORTHLESS ON EVERY LEVEL, BUT SOMEHOW I'M STILL DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
3927
I AM A HATCHED LEADER AND YOU KNOW IT.
3927
HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF YOUR COCOON IN THE MORNING KNOWING YOU'RE THE WORST THING A UNIVERSE WAS EVER RESPONSIBLE FOR?
3927
ALSO IT MUST BE HARD WITH YOUR HANDS TO PERSISTENTLY BOTHERING EVERY MUTATED SET OF GENITALS PEPPERING THAT GHASTLY HUSK YOU PAWN OFF AS A BODY.
3927
HAS A FEMALE EVER LOOKED AT YOU WITHOUT AT ONCE TURNING SKYWARD AND ERUPTING LIKE A VOMIT VOLCANO, ANSWER ME THAT.
3927
I GUESS THESE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE DO GET KIND OF EMBARRASSING IN RETROSPECT.
3927
ARE WE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE BECAUSE OF STUFF I SAID.
3927
IT'S A JOKE MORON.
3927
HONESTLY I'M JUST GLAD NOBODY ELSE IS PRIVVY TO OUR CONVERSATIONS.
3927
ACTUALLY WHY DON'T WE MAKE A PACT TO DELETE THIS ONE FROM OUR LOGS, I'M JUST SHUDDERING HERE SCROLLING UP AND READING THIS.
3958
HEY GUESS WHAT, BIG NEWS.
3958
LIKE HOLY SHIT STOP THE PRESSES THIS IS A HUMONGOUS DEAL SORT OF NEWS.
3958
YOU'RE NOT THE RED TEAM LEADER.
3958
THAT'S ME.
3958
I'M THE LEADER.
3958
IT'S BEEN DECIDED.
3958
ON AN OFFICIAL BASIS.
3958
WHAT, NO.
3958
I MEAN YOU CAN BUT IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD BECAUSE I'M THE LEADER AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO EVACUATE THROUGH YOUR PROTEIN CHUTE ON THE MATTER.
3958
THAT'S A LIE, YOU'RE MORE OF A MELODRAMA SPAZ QUEEN THAN ME AND YOU KNOW IT AND THIS STUFF YOUR SAYING IS A PRETEND STUNT.
3958
YOU'RE LIKE A ROCKET PROPELLED SPAZ MAGGOT SPRINGLOADED UP THE ASS OF A PSYCHEDELIC FUCKING FREAKOUT WEASEL ON IDIOT DRUGS SO LETS NOT PLAY MAKEBELIEVE GAMES HERE.
3958
LEADER.
3958
ME.
3958
OK, GREAT.
3958
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION I HAVE SELECTED YOU TO BE MY SECOND IN COMMAND.
3958
FUCK YOU OFFER RESCINDED.
3958
HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT.
3958
I'M AN INCREDIBLE LEADER WITH ALL KINDS OF PRIORITIZATION AND COMMAND SKILLS.
3958
I'M GOING TO ROCK THE COCK OFF THIS WEATHERVANE AND THE BLUE TEAM WILL WISH THEY NEVER SLITHERED OUT OF THE MOTHER GRUB'S HEINOUS UNDULATING ASSHOLE.
3958
SO JUST GIVE ME THE FULL BRIEFING, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.
3958
SEE THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
3958
THIS IS WHAT I WAS MADE FOR.
3958
BEING IN CHARGE OF ADVENTURE, RUNNING AROUND AND STUFF, AND FUCKING SHIT UP LIKE A GODDAMN HERO WITH A RIPPERWASP IN HIS JOCK.
3958
LET'S GET CRACKING HERE.
3958
LAUNCH YOUR SERVER OR WHATEVER, I'LL INSTALL THE HERO PROGRAM.
3958
YEAH.
3958
YES, EXACTLY.
3958
NOW YOU ARE MAKING SENSE.
3958
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT SANE PEOPLE SAY.
3958
KEEP AT IT, THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU YET.
3958
WHAT'S A BABY.
3958
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE.
3958
WHY NOT?
3958
WHY HAVE YOU NEVER MENTIONED THIS ANYWAY?
3958
HONESTLY TEREZI IT SOUNDS LIKE MORE FROTHING LOONEYBLOCK NONSENSE.
3958
OH THANK GOD YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING NORMAL, I WAS STARTING TO WORRY THERE.
3958
WHEW BACK IN SANE LAND.
3958
WE NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THAT FUCKING TREE AND INTO A PROPER GODDAMN LAWNRING.
3958
YOU'VE BEEN STUNTED LIVING UP THERE, BY THE WHISPERS OF FUCKING BARK GNOMES OR SOMETHING.
3958
I THINK ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS WAS JUST CULLED RECENTLY, MAYBE YOU COULD LIVE THERE.
3958
OK WELL
3958
SPEAKING OF THAT
3958
I SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS AND DEAL WITH THIS GRUMPY CUSTOMER.
3958
IT'S GOING TO FONDLE MAJOR SEEDFLAP, BUT HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE QUICK.
3958
YOU CAN ESTABLISH YOUR CONNECTION AND DO YOUR TRIVIAL SIDEKICK STUFF I GUESS IN THE MEANTIME.
3961
YOU CAN SEE ME RIGHT.
3961
TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.
3961
OH YEAH.
3961
ANYWAY, PRESS YOUR NOSE AGAINST YOUR SLOBBERY SCREEN AND TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.
3961
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU JUST TOOK A HARD DRAG OF MY LOAD GAPER WHICH FOR SOME REASON I HAVE DISCOVERED OUTSIDE ON THIS LITTLE ISLAND.
3961
WELL OOH LA LA.
3961
EXCUSE MY DISDAIN FOR YOUR BLUE BLOODED VERNACULAR.
3961
WHOA NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
3961
SERIOUSLY WAS THAT A SERIOUS QUESTION?
3961
UNBELIEVABLE.
3961
WHAT IS WITH YOUR OBSESSION WITH COLORS.
3961
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU WASTE ALL MY HARD EARNED GRIST RAMBLING MY HIVE AROUND LIKE THAT NOT EVEN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FUCKING GATE.
3961
BUT THEN YOU GO AND SPEND IT ON AN UGLY PAINT JOB.
3961
I KILLED A LOT OF IMPS FOR THAT GRIST.
3961
YEAH RIGHT.
3961
MORE LIKE...
3961
ADORABLOODTHIRSTY.
3961
I'M PRANCING AROUND BEING THAT, OK?
3961
ANYWAY THIS IS AWFUL, THIS IS NO WAY FOR A LEADER TO BE TREATED.
3961
NO, THIS IS NOT ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR WHAT BULLSHIT IS.
3961
A LEADER SHOULDN'T BE AT THE MERCY OF THE HIVE RENOVATION WHIMSY OF A PSYCHOTIC BLIND GIRL.
3961
WHEN DO I GET THE CHANCE TO FUCK UP SOMEONE'S HIVE.
3961
I SHOULD BE THE NEXT ONE TO CONNECT TO A CLIENT.
3961
MORE LIES.
3961
WHOA WAIT, WHAT?
3961
METEORS?
3961
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
3961
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH METEORS.
3961
44 WHAT?
3961
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
3961
WELL WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME SO I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ANY OF THOSE DOUBLETALKING ASSHOLES.
3986
HEY.
3986
GUESS WHO THE RED LEADER IS?
3986
I'M THE LEADER. IT'S ME.
3986
YOUR PLAN TO CRIPPLE YOUR RIVAL TEAM HAS FAILED.
3986
HAHAHA! SO PATHETIC.
3986
THIS IS YET ANOTHER FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN YOUR OPPOSITION.
3986
TEREZI AND I HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED A CONNECTION AND WE ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS HERE.
3986
WE ARE A GREAT TEAM, AND I AM A FANTASTIC LEADER.
3986
WE WILL BEAT THIS GAME IN NO TIME, WHILE YOUR TEAM IS CLEARLY STILL ASLEEP AT THE THORAX.
3986
AMAZING.
3986
YOU'RE EITHER BEING REALLY PERSISTENT WITH THIS TRANSPARENT RUSE, OR YOU REALLY ARE JUST THAT SAD AND INCOMPETENT.
3986
NEITHER CASE DESERVES MY RESPECT OR MY FRIENDSHIP.
3986
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT, FRIENDSHIP CANCELED.
3986
THERE IT'S OFFICIAL, BYE BYE FRIENDSHIP!
3986
TO BE HONEST I DON'T SEE WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT YOUR PROGRAMMING OR HACKING.
3986
WHAT IS A HACKER EVEN? JUST SOME SMUG ASSHOLE IN MOVIES DOING FAKE THINGS AND MAKING UP WORDS.
3986
IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL THING TO BE, IT'S JUST SOME BULLSHIT TITLE YOU GAVE YOURSELF SO YOU CAN FEEL JUST A TINY BIT LESS LOATHESOME.
3986
NO IT'S ALL SO CLEAR NOW, YOU WERE A FRAUD ALL ALONG.
3986
WHAT DOES ALL THIS NONSENSICAL CODE YOU WROTE EVEN DO?
3986
IT'S ALL NONSENSE.
3986
LIKE A BLUFF. YOU JUST SAY, OH KARKAT WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT I WROTE IS BULLSHIT BECAUSE HE'S TOO DUMB TO FIGURE IT OUT.
3986
WELL YOU'RE BUSTED, THESE VIRUSES HERE I BET DO NOTHING AT ALL.
3986
I BET IF I RAN THEM NOTHING BAD WOULD HAPPEN.
3986
MIGHT EVEN IMPROVE MY COMPUTER'S PERFORMANCE!
3986
HOW ABOUT THIS IDIOTIC PROGRAM WITH THE RED AND BLUE CODE, WHICH IS A MEANINGLESS THING TO DO WITH CODE ANYWAY.
3986
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR SCAMS.
3986
WHY NOT SNEAK SOME BAD CLIP ART INTO THE FILES TOO, AND PRETEND THAT'S CODE???
3986
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
3986
AH HA. JUST AS I THOUGHT, YOU CAN'T EVEN COME UP WITH A GOOD LIE WHEN I PRESS YOU ON IT.
3986
YOUR BLUFF HAS BEEN CALLED.
3986
COMPILING AS WE SPEAK, IT WILL AUTORUN WHEN IT FINISHES.
3986
AND NOW I HAVE TO GO ATTEND TO SOMETHING OUTSIDE, BECAUSE TEREZI IS DOING SOMETHING JUST UNSPEAKABLY STUPID RIGHT NOW.
3986
WHOOPS, FORGET I SAID THAT. IT WAS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION.
3986
LATER DOUCHE BAG.
4061
HEY.
4061
KARKAT CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS TO SINK THIS LOW.
4061
KARKAT CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S ASKING AN AUTISTIC GIRL IN A CAVE TO JOIN HIS TEAM.
4061
KARKAT MYSTIFIES IN INFINITE BEFUDDLEMENT OVER THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PRESENTLY THE BEST REMAINING CANDIDATE FOR THE RED TEAM.
4061
YES AND KARKAT CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THAT.
4061
KARKAT THINKS ABOUT THAT A BIT AND HIS JAW DROPS OPEN AND BREAKS A HUGE COLUMN OF BRICKS LIKE A FUCKING KUNG FU MASTER.
4061
OK GOOD, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING.
4061
EVEN IF IT'S IN THE MOST INANE POSSIBLE CONTEXT.
4061
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF IT.
4061
OK, BRIEFING:
4061
ME, TEREZI, GAMZEE AND TAVROS ARE ALL PLAYING NOW.
4061
THE CONNECTION ORDER IS AT -> TC -> GC -> CG.
4061
WE NEED SOMEONE TO CONNECT TO TOREADOR AND GET HIM IN THE GAME.
4061
I HAVE GA LINED UP FOR THE RED TEAM BECAUSE SHE IS ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING SANE ONES LEFT TO PLAY.
4061
OK, THE ONLY SANE ONE.
4061
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO CONNECT YET BECAUSE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS BULLSHIT, SO I WAS LIKE WHATEVER, WHAT ELSE IS NEW.
4061
SO I GUESS THAT LEAVES YOU.
4061
TEREZI SAID SHE HAD YOU LINED UP TO PLAY BACK WHEN SHE WAS THE FAKE LEADER, SO I SAID FINE.
4061
SO JUST CONNECT TO TAVROS AND LATER WE'LL WORRY ABOUT GETTING YOU IN.
4061
OH GOD.
4061
ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUS.
4061
THIS BOGGLES MY MIND.
4061
HOW CAN YOU BE BEST FRIENDS WITH THE ONLY GUY ON THE PLANET WHO'S A BIGGER ASSHOLE THAN ME.
4061
HE'S SCUM.
4061
BUT DO WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT TO DO I GUESS.
4061
TAVROS IS WAITING.
4077
HEY ASSHOLE, STOP PLAYING GAMES FOR GIRLS.
4078
44 WHAT?
4078
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
4078
WELL WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME SO I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ANY OF THOSE DOUBLETALKING ASSHOLES.
4078
OH MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME.
4078
YES I'M GLAD YOU ASKED, BECAUSE THERE IS A WIDE OPEN SLOT FOR THE MOST VILE BACKSTABBING SOCIOPATH WHO EVER LIVED.
4078
YOU REALLY HELPED ME OUT OF A JAM BY STEPPING FORWARD.
4078
HA HA HA!
4078
MORE CAGEY CUTESY BULLSHIT.
4078
LIKE I'M NOT UP TO MY LOBE STEM WITH THAT ALREADY HAVING TO DEAL WITH TEREZI.
4078
YOU BOTH MUST HAVE BEEN INSUFFERABLE WHEN YOU WERE A TEAM.
4078
YOUR OPPONENTS PROBABLY ALL JUST TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF PUTTING UP WITH YOUR FANGY GRINNED DRIVEL.
4078
THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN WHEN THE SHIT HIT THE THRESHER.
4078
BECOMING FRIENDS, WHAT THE FUCK.
4078
WE WILL NEVER BE FRIENDS, MORON.
4078
NO. MORE LIKE TWITCHY EYED PROJECTILE VOMITING IN UTTER DISGUST FRIENDS, WHILE I PERFORATE MY BONE BULGE WITH A CULLING FORK.
4078
GET LOST.
4078
OH! OH REALLY?????
4078
WAIT, LET ME COUNT OUT EIGHT OF THESE THINGS, HOLD ON. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
4078
THERE, I AM NOW AN ENORMOUS TOOL FOREVER.
4078
YAWN.
4078
NO YOU'RE JUST A RUN OF THE MILL LITTLE PSYCHO GIRL, A TROLL CAEGAR A DOZEN.
4078
I'LL BE TAKING APART THE BLUE TEAM WITH BRUTAL EFFICIENCY, YOU'LL SEE.
4078
YOU NEVER PLAYED ONE OF YOUR DUMB GAMES WITH ME SO YOU NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING WHAT I CAN DO.
4078
ENJOY THE SHOW, SWEETHEART.
4078
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT USING YOUR MIND CONTROL TRICKS ON MY PLAYERS.
4078
REMEMBER YOUR TRUCE?
4078
YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME.
4078
YEAH OK.
4078
WHATEVER, DON'T EVEN TRY IT.
4078
I'VE GOT THE BETTER SCOURGE SISTER ON MY TEAM AND IF YOU BREAK YOUR TRUCE YOU'LL HAVE TO ANSWER TO HER.
4078
THE FUNNY THING IS SHE WAS ALWAYS WAY BETTER THAN YOU EVEN WITHOUT ANY POWERS.
4078
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, I KNOW YOUR WHOLE STORY.
4078
YOU WERE ALWAYS JEALOUS SHE COULD MANIPULATE PEOPLE SO WELL WITHOUT RESORTING TO CHEAP MIND TRICKS.
4078
HAHA, I CAN TELL THIS BURNS YOU AND I CAN'T EVEN PAW THROUGH YOUR DUMPSTER!
4078
CHALK IT UP AS ANOTHER INFURIATING VICTORY FOR GUTTER BLOOD OVER ARISTOCRACY.
4078
OH WHAT'S THAT, NOTHING TO SAY?
4078
WOW SPEECHLESS I GUESS. YOU'RE PROBABLY CRYING RIGHT NOW. THAT WOULD MAKE MY FUCKING DAY.
4078
HEY LOOK AT ME BEING THE ONE TO TALK SHIT AT WARP SPEED THEN LOG OFF BEFORE YOU CAN REPLY.
4078
BYE, IDIOT.
4078
YOU MADE ME DO THAT.
4078
AND YOU KNOW IT.
4196
OK THIS IS GOING TO SOUND PREPOSTEROUS GIVEN OUR LAST CONVERSATION.
4196
AND I GUESS PRACTICALLY EVERY CONVERSATION PRECEDING IT.
4196
AND I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DISGUSTING LIKE APOLOGIZE.
4196
AND EVEN THOUGH I'LL HATE MYSELF FOR IT I WILL TOTALLY MEAN IT, I PROMISE.
4196
LIKE, REALLY REALLY MEAN IT.
4196
YEAH.
4196
HOW DID YOU KNOW.
4196
HAHAHAHA WOW THAT IS GREAT.
4196
WAIT, SORRY.
4196
NO WAIT, I DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE NOW.
4196
I APOLOGIZE TO MYSELF FOR OFFERING YOU A SHITTY MEANINGLESS APOLOGY.
4196
APOLOGY ACCEPTED, KARKAT. LET'S BURY THE THRESHER WITH A TOTALLY PLATONIC BRO BULGE BUMP.
4196
BUMP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
4196
I'M NOT TRYING TO BUG YOU I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO JOIN MY DAMN TEAM, NOW STEP IN LINE SERKET.
4196
OK, WELL, SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.
4196
BUT I MEAN YOU CAN JUST DUMP HER CARCASS IN THE KERNEL AND BRING HER BACK STRONGER THAN EVER.
4196
NOW WHY DON'T YOU HOP IN THE TRAP, WASH THAT NASTY BLUE SHIT OFF, AND JOIN OUR FUCKING SESSION ALREADY.
4196
BLAH BLAH BLAH.
4196
NOW MY CHUTE IS DOING A FUCKING STELLAR IMPRESSION OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.
4196
NO IT SUCKS.
4196
TOTALLY HAPPY WITH MINE, NICE TRY THOUGH.
4196
IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS.
4196
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BE A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD.
4196
I'M NOT GOING TO WEAR THAT SHIT ON MY SLEEVE LIKE YOU DO.
4196
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.
4196
IT'S PRIVATE, SO EVERYONE CAN GO POINT THEIR PROBING BUSYBODY SNIFFNODES UP THEIR OWN IMPERTINENT SEED FLAPS.
4196
OK FIRST THING'S FIRST.
4196
YOU'VE GOT TO CONNECT WITH TAVROS QUICKLY AND GET HIM IN THE SESSION BEFORE HE GETS KILLED.
4196
WHAT.
4196
NO. WHY.
4196
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, JUST DO IT.
4196
WHO CARES.
4196
WHY DO YOU EVEN HATE HIM, IT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
4196
IF ANYTHING YOU SHOULD PITY HIM.
4196
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU WERE THE ONE WHO PARALYZED HIM.
4196
THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD TIME TO BE CONFIDING IN ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS OF BLACK ROMANCE BUT OK.
4196
I MEAN IF YOU'RE REALLY IMPLYING TAVROS IS YOUR KISMESIS I THINK YOU'RE BRAYING UP THE WRONG FROND NUB.
4196
BOTH PARTIES HAVE TO HATE EACH OTHER EQUALLY, I MEAN LIKE TRUE HATE.
4196
MAYBE YOUR FEELINGS COME SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO FITTING THE BILL BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN HATE ANYONE, IT'S WEIRD, HE'S KIND OF BROKEN IN THE HEAD.
4196
I THINK THIS SUBJECT IS BEYOND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S GRASP BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT, NOBODY EVER REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT THOUGH.
4196
OK, MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR LOBE STEM CAUTERIZED ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING THE TWO PRIMARY EMOTIONS, HATE AND PITY.
4196
PITY IS OF COURSE JUST THE TONED DOWN VERSION OF THE CENTRAL EMOTION, HATE.
4196
AND ALL THE NUANCES OF PITY MANIFEST AS VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF FEELINGS LIKE WHATEVER CHEMICAL REACTIONS TRIGGER MATING FONDESS OR THE MYSTERIOUS FORCES THAT ARE BEHIND MOIRALLEGIANCE.
4196
A WELL BALANCED PERSON IS IS GOING TO HAVE A GOOD DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN HATE AND THE VARIOUS PITY HUMORS.
4196
HAVING A GOOD BALANCE KEEPS ALL THE EMOTIONS SHARPER, SEE I THINK THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
4196
SEE, MY HATE IS LIKE A FINELY TUNED INSTRUMENT BECAUSE I'M AWARE OF THESE PRINCIPLES.
4196
I COULD HATE A HOLE IN PARADOX SPACE ITSELF, STRAIGHT THROUGH TO A NEW REALITY FRESH FOR THE HATING.
4196
BUT SEE, YOU'RE TOO HEAVY ON THE HATE SIDE, OR AT LEAST YOU PRETEND TO BE WHICH IS MAYBE WORSE.
4196
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE HATING UP EVERYONE HARD WHEN YOU'RE REALLY JUST BURNING OUT THAT ENTIRE EMOTIONAL HEMISPHERE.
4196
IT'S LIKE LUKEWARM HATE. PRETENDER'S HATE, WITH NO COUNTERPOINT AT ALL.
4196
AS SUCH THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTANCE TO YOUR HATE, IT'S LIKE A CARDBOARD MOVIE PROP.
4196
WHICH IS WHY YOUR BRAIN IS BROKEN, KIND OF LIKE TAVROS'S BUT ON THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE I GUESS.
4196
OR MAYBE YOUR BROKEN BRAIN LED TO THE IMBALANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, I DON'T KNOW.
4196
WHATEVER THE CASE IS, YOU'RE KIND OF EMOTIONALLY SCREWED, SORRY TO SAY.
4196
YOUR HATE'S TOO DULL FOR A PROPER KISMESIS, IN MY OPINION.
4196
AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO BE YOUR MOIRAIL HONESTLY, UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BOTHER PITYING YOU.
4196
AND LANDING A MATESPRIT? HAHAHAHA!
4196
SERIOUSLY, LIKE THAT WOULD EVEN INTEREST YOU.
4196
BASICALLY ANY FEATURE OF YOUR EMOTIONAL PROFILE THAT USUALLY MAKES SOMEONE VIABLE IN THE REDROM DEPARTMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FRIED.
4196
YOUR BLACKROM POTENTIAL'S PROBABLY TOAST TOO.
4196
HEY.
4196
ARE YOU THERE.
4196
NO WAY, I COULD GO ON.
4196
THIS IS FASCINATING, TELL ME HOW THE FUCK THIS ISN'T FASCINATING.
4196
THEY'RE REALLY INTRIGUING SOCIOLOGICALLY.
4196
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX, SOPHISTICATED STORIES, YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.
4196
WHAT PART OF INTRIGUING SOCIOLOGICALLY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND.
4196
ALSO THEY'RE AWESOME, SHUT UP.
4196
YEAH OK.
4196
OH, WAIT!
4196
I NEVER EVEN GOT TO THE DAMN POINT.
4196
I DIDN'T NEED YOU SPECIFICALLY TO CONNECT TO TAVROS, I MEAN I COULD GET ANY SCHLUB TO DO THAT.
4196
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET IN HERE ASAP BECAUSE I REALLY NEED YOUR MIND POWERS.
4196
I RAN INTO SOMEONE HERE.
4196
A SORT OF DOUBLE AGENT I GUESS.
4196
HIS NAME IS JACK.
4197
HE HAS SOME INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HIS KINGDOM.
4197
HE WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH US TO OVERTHROW THE BLACK QUEEN.
4197
SO I SAID OK.
4197
AND NOW I NEED YOUR HELP.
4197
HE RECENTLY GOT HOLD OF SOME INTEL REGARDING A WEAKNESS IN THE QUEEN'S DEFENSES.
4197
I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN THAT.
4197
BUT WE'VE GOT TO HURRY AND GET STARTED ON THIS THING, OR IT COULD GET KIND OF AWKWARD.
4197
I MEAN HE'S JUST STANDING HERE NOW.
4197
WAITING FOR ME I GUESS.
4197
BUT IT'S OK, I THINK HE'S PRETTY MUCH SETTLED DOWN.
4197
WELL, HE STABBED ME ONCE.
4197
NO, NO, IT'S COOL.
4197
HE'S COOL, IT'S FINE I DON'T REALLY MIND THE STABBING, IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.
4197
WELL OK I'M PRETTY SURE HE MEANT TO STAB ME.
4197
BUT I KIND OF THINK THAT'S LIKE
4197
THE WAY HE GREETS PEOPLE?
4197
IN ANY CASE I THINK HE'S PROBABLY ALL STABBED OUT.
4197
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
4197
SHE CAN'T SEE ME OR SMELL ME OR ANYTHING, I'M WAY OUT OF MY HIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET.
4197
NO, JACK WON'T TELL, I MADE HIM PROMISE HE WOULDN'T TELL.
4197
YEAH BUT I'M PRETTY SURE ONLY SOLLUX KNOWS HOW TO SET THAT UP, AND HE'S BEEN INCOMMUNICADO FOR HOURS FOR SOME REASON.
4197
ANYWAY THAT WHOLE FEATURE SEEMS TOTALLY INVASIVE AND LARGELY POINTLESS TO ME, SO JUST FORGET IT.
4197
WHATEVER.
4197
JUST GET YOUR ASS IN HERE SO WE CAN DETHRONE THIS GODDAMN QUEEN.
4197
IT'LL MEAN ONE LESS GOD BOSS WE HAVE TO FIGHT.
4370
BRO ARE YOU OK.
4370
HEY
4370
OH GOD
4370
WHAT HAVE I DONE.
4370
SOLLUX?
4370
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S JUST HONEY.
4370
PLEASE JUST BE HONEY PLEASE JUST BE HONEY PLEASE JUST BE HONEY
4370
HAHA, OK, MAKE-BELIEVE TIME IS OVER!
4370
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD
4443
OK I THINK I SET THIS UP RIGHT.
4443
FUCK I SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER BOARD NAME.
4443
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE NAME IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SINCE THAT'S THE NAME THAT
4443
UH
4443
I ALREADY READ.
4443
WOW THAT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ANYBODY.
4443
WHATEVER, IT'S JUST A STUPID NAME, LET'S JUST DO THIS.
4443
THIS IS A PUBLIC BULLETIN USING TROLLIAN'S WEIRD TRANSTIMELINE FEATURES WHICH I DON'T EVEN REALLY UNDERSTAND YET.
4443
BUT I'M GUESSING MIGHT BE USEFUL.
4443
I'VE INCLUDED ALL TWELVE PLAYERS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LIST SO YOU SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO READ THESE MEMOS AT ANY TIME.
4443
THAT IS, ALL THE MEMOS POSTED, PAST AND FUTURE. I THINK.
4443
IT COULD GET PRETTY TEMPORALLY CONFUSING OBVIOUSLY. I'M GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THE MEMOS AS SIMPLE AND LINEAR AS POSSIBLE.
4443
ALSO LET'S KEEP THIS A ONE-WAY-ONLY BULLETIN TO MAKE THIS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.
4443
DO NOT REPLY TO MY MEMOS!!! THIS IS NOT A FUCKING CHATROOM, ASSHOLES.
4443
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME IN RESPONSE TO A MEMO, MESSAGE ME IN PRIVATE AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT ON THE TIMELINE.
4443
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS ABOUT THE TEAMS.
4443
AS OF NOW, YOU SHOULD ALL BE AWARE THAT THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE TEAM, AND WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.
4443
AND BY "NOW" I MEAN TIME LOCAL TO ME AS OF WRITING THIS.
4443
SO IF YOU'RE READING THIS IN THE PAST...
4443
UH OK FIRST OF ALL, HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS FEATURE ALREADY? SECOND WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING TELL ME.
4443
WHATEVER I DIGRESS.
4443
IF YOU'RE READING THIS IN THE FUTURE THEN WHO CARES, IT'S PROBABLY OLD NEWS TO YOU.
4443
ACTUALLY NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT READING THIS IN THE FUTURE?
4443
IT'S LIKE ANY BULLETIN BOARD, YOU POST STUFF AND IT SITS THERE FOR A WHILE AND PEOPLE IN "THE FUTURE" READ IT.
4443
HUH. BIG FUCKING DEAL I GUESS.
4443
ANYWAY LIKE I WAS SAYING.
4443
ONE BIG TEAM, OVER WHICH I HAVE ASSUMED TOTAL LEADERSHIP.
4443
I WILL ASSUME THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO STAY THIS WAY FOR THE DURATION OF OUR QUEST, AND THAT I WILL REMAIN AN IMPECCABLE LEADER FOR A SPAN OF HUNDREDS OF HOURS WHILE I GUIDE US ALL TO A STUNNING VICTORY.
4443
IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO ASSUME.
4443
I BROWSED THROUGH THIS WHOLE BULLETIN IN ADVANCE, AND IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THE CASE. GO ME.
4443
IN FACT, SINCE I'VE SEEN WHAT I WILL WRITE IN THE FUTURE, I WONDER WHAT IMPETUS I WILL HAVE FOR WRITING IT LATER WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO?
4443
I WONDER IF I COULD JUST COPY/PASTE IT... HOLD ON.
4443
DAMN.
4443
I GUESS THEY THOUGHT OF THAT? I DUNNO. I TRIED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE BULLETIN AGAIN, BUT NOW THAT I'VE OPENED THIS ONE FROM THE BEGINNING, I CAN'T SEE THE WHOLE THING ANYMORE.
4443
UNLESS I LOOK AT IT ON ONE OF YOUR COMPUTERS...
4443
OR MAYBE IF YOU SEND ME LIKE A TEXT FILE OF IT? WOULD THAT CAUSE A PARADOX OR SOMETHING?
4443
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS SO STUPID.
4443
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER READING ALL THIS SHIT LIKE A HALF HOUR AGO, AND NOW HERE I AM TYPING IT ANYWAY.
4443
I PROBABLY CAN'T AVOID TYPING ANY OF THIS, HOW WEIRD IS THAT.
4443
I HATE TIME TRAVEL.
4443
HOLY FUCKING SHIT, ARE YOU PEOPLE RETARDED.
4443
OK SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS FROM LIKE 5 HOURS IN THE FUTURE JUST TO GIVE ME A HARD TIME, NICE.
4443
WELL THANKS FOR THE HELP, SO WHEN DO I BAN YOU, FUTURE BOY?
4443
ARE YOU REALLY STILL SORE AT ME FIVE HOURS LATER FOR RUNNING THAT VIRUS, GOD DAMN GET OVER IT.
4443
IT WAS YOUR FUCKING VIRUS ANYWAY, YOU'RE TO BLAME.
4443
OH YEAH?
4443
THIS IS BS ISN'T IT.
4443
TROLLING ME FROM THE FUTURE, HOW JUVENILE CAN YOU GET.
4443
OH FUCK THIS CONDESCENDING FUTURE KNOWITALL ACT, WE AREN'T BUMPING SHIT, YOU ARE SO BANNED.
4443
AND SO THE PORCINE HOOF BELONGING TO THE SWOLLEN HAG KNOWN AS LADY DESTINY HAS STOMPED ANOTHER THROAT.
4443
WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKERS IS NEXT?
4443
NOBODY???
4443
OK, GOOD.
4443
ALTHOUGH I'M FAIRLY SURE I REMEMBER SOMEONE ELSE CHIMING IN BEFORE I CLOSED THIS MEMO.
4443
YOU ADD DISORDERED SHIT RINSERS CAN'T KEEP YOUR LASCIVIOUS PRONGS OUT OF THE ROE HOLE, CAN YOU.
4443
SOLLUX, FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, OR PAST REFERENCE OR WHATEVER
4443
IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF ROLEPLAYING, YOU CAN START YOUR OWN BULLETIN.
4443
YOU CAN ALL ACT LIKE BRAINDEAD ASSWIPES IN YOUR OWN FESTERING FLAP OF PARADOX SPACE, FINE WITH ME.
4443
EVERYONE WILL BE SO CONFUSED BY THE TIME PARADOXES, IT WILL DISTRACT THEM FROM HOW AWFUL THEIR TERRIBLE HOBBIES ARE.
4443
CHOOSE YOUR CLASSES NOW! LEVEL 69 NOOKSNIFFER IS UP FOR GRABS, WHO WANTS IT.
4443
NO THAT'S NOT AN INVITATION FOR YOU FUCKING NERDS TO COME IN HERE AND CORRECT ME ON YOUR GODDAMN FAIRY ELVES.
4443
JUST DO ME A FAVOR AND KEEP ME BANNED FROM THAT ONE OK.
4443
I'LL RETURN THE FAVOR IF YOU NERD UP MY MEMOS, I SERIOUSLY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY FUCKING NERDS ARE ON THIS TEAM.
4443
JUST REMEMBER THIS IS MY PERSONAL PODIUM, A STUMP IF YOU WILL, FOR SOLE USE BY ME AS LEADER FOR IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP BUSINESS.
4443
GOT IT?????????
4443
GROAN.
4443
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.
4443
WHAT WAS I EVEN THINKING.
4443
STFU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4443
OK, I'M FED UP WITH THIS MEMO, GONNA CLOSE IT OUT.
4443
YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN LATER WHEN I GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY, I.E. JUST SCROLL DOWN YOU DOUCHE.
4443
IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE ALREADY.
4443
BECAUSE OF
4443
TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVEL!
4443
I KNOW, RIGHT?
4443
ANYWAY, JUST TO REITERATE:
4443
FULL STEAM AHEAD
4443
LEADER = ME FOREVER, OBVIOUSLY
4443
PEACE THE FUCK OUT DBAGS
4443
SWEET MOTHER GRUB'S OOZING VESTIGIAL THIRD ORAL SPHINCTER.
4443
HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE BE SO STUPID.
4443
OH I HAVE A SHORT FUSE! THAT'S VERY FUNNY, YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR ME LAUGH OVER THE SOUND OF THE ROBOT YOU ARE PROBABLY BEATING TO DEATH.
4443
OR DOING WORSE TO.
4443
HEY, YOU DO KISS YOUR ROBOTS, RIGHT?
4443
MIGHT AS WELL CLEAR THE AIR AS LONG AS WE'RE BROADCASTING THIS ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPACETIME CONTINUUM.
4443
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4443
THE FUNNY THING IS IN THE FUTURE EVERYONE WILL RECOGNIZE ME AS THE UNDISPUTED LEADER, EVEN YOU.
4443
YOU WILL BE STANDING ON THE TIPPYTOES OF YOUR IDIOTIC METAL SHOES, TAKING DELICATE PURCHASE OF MY NUBBY HORNS AND HOISTING YOURSELF OVER MY HEAD TO PUT YOUR SWEATIEST TOUGH GUY SMOOCH UPON MY TWITCHING SPINE LUMP.
4443
IT WILL BE TENDER AND DEFERENTIAL, LIKE A PAUPER KISSING A NOBLE'S RING.
4443
JUST SCROLL DOWN, READ THE LOGS.
4443
YOU'RE GETTING OFF ON THIS AREN'T YOU
4443
THIS EXCITES YOU, BEING THE TOUGH GUY AND PRETENDING LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING THE AWESOME LEADER IN HIS PLACE.
4443
YOU'RE PROBABLY WORKING UP A GOOD SWEAT.
4443
HOPE YOU ALCHEMIZED A BUNCH OF SPARE TOWELS.
4443
HEY WHY DON'T YOU && THEM WITH YOUR SPONGEY BRAIN FOR EXTRA ABSORBENCY.
4447
THIS IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO START A NEW MEMO.
4447
IN FACT IT'S A BETTER TIME THAN ANY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF CHAT CLIENT PREDESTINATION I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE DO I.
4447
FUCK.
4447
IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S STILL A GOOD TIME TO DO IT.
4447
PEOPLE, WE NEED TO GET ORGANIZED HERE.
4447
SHIT IS GETTING SERIOUS.
4447
WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON OPERATION REGISURP, A CUNNING PLAN DEVISED BY DOUBLE ARCHAGENT JACK NOIR TO EXILE THE BLACK QUEEN.
4447
WE WILL NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR THIS, EVEN THE IDIOTS.
4447
AND ONCE AGAIN, A REMINDER
4447
DO NOT TROLL ME IN THESE MEMOS FROM ANY POINT IN TIME OR IT'S AN INSTA-BAN.
4447
ALSO A NOTE TO MY FUTURE SELF
4447
IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING SMUG, DO ME A FAVOR AND SHOVE A THROB STALK IN IT.
4447
JUST SIT THERE PATIENTLY AND WAIT FOR ME TO BECOME YOU IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME, THUS IMPROVING YOUR INTELLECT DRASTICALLY.
4447
OR, INTELLECTS PLURAL.
4447
I FORGOT, THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU FUCKERS OUT THERE.
4447
ALL OF YOU, JUST ZIP YOUR CHUTES. I MEAN SERIOUSLY, LIKE THERE'S NOTHING BETTER TO DO IN THE FUTURE???
4447
IT'S THE FUTURE FOR GOD'S SAKE, A REALM OF ENDLESS FUCKING POSSIBILITIES.
4447
NOW
4447
BEFORE WE GET STARTED, LET'S TAKE A TOLL OF THE SITUATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
4447
*MY* POINT IN TIME.
4447
WHO'S IN SO FAR, WHO'S NOT, ETCETERA.
4447
OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
4447
NO, DUDE, DON'T DRINK THAT SHIT. IF IT WERE UP TO HIM WE WOULD ALL DRINK FAYGO AT ONCE IN SOME RITUALISTIC RAP CLOWN SUICIDE PACT.
4447
BUT INSTEAD OF COMMITTING SUICIDE THE THING THAT WE ALL ACCOMPLISH IS BECOMING INSTANTANEOUS ASSHOLES WITH AWFUL TASTE.
4447
THIS ISN'T THE VENUE FOR AIRING YOUR FUTURE PROBLEMS, COUNT SEA DIPSHIT.
4447
OK, WELL
4447
I GET THAT, I HEAR YOU BRO
4447
BUT THIS IS STILL NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS SO I'VE GOT TO BAN YOU.
4447
BUT SERIOUSLY JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH ME IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OK MAN?
4447
WE'LL GET YOUR SHIT STRAIGHTENED OUT.
4447
OK.
4447
IS EVERYBODY GOOD?
4447
JUST GONNA SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE, LOCAL TIME, AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS ANY SHIT THEY WANT TO SCRAPE OFF THEIR BULGE ON TO MY CLEAN NUTRITION PLATEAU.
4447
NOBODY?
4447
GREAT, WONDERFUL.
4447
I NOW OFFICIALLY DECLARE THE NONSENSE PORTION OF THIS MEMO TO BE OVER.
4447
THIS DECREE SHALL BE BINDING AND LASTING.
4447
BACK TO PLANNING REGISURP.
4447
BEAR DOWN EVERYBODY, THIS IS FUCKING IMPORTANT, THERE IS A QUEEN ON THE LOOSE AND WE'VE GOT TO SHOW A BITCH THE DOOR.
4447
UN BE FUCKING LIEVABLE.
4447
HEY CAN FUTURE YOU MIND-PREVENT ME FROM HITTING THE BAN BUTTON?
4447
I'M GENUINELY CURIOUS! GO AHEAD, TRY TO STOP ME I DARE YOU.
4447
OH, ALL OF THEM YOU SAY?
4447
FASCINATING.
4447
HEY FORGET THE BAN BUTTON, USE YOUR MIND POWERS TO HELP ME LOCATE THE DESPERATELY ATTEMPT TO GIVE A SHIT BUTTON. WHOOPS WE BOTH FAILED, IT DOESN'T EXIST.
4447
EVERYBODY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?? SUPERFUTURE VRISKA HAS AN IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON FOR US ALL.
4447
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUR PRESENT RESPONSIBILIES AND OBLIGATIONS!
4447
BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT, IN THE FUTURE ALL THAT STUFF ALREADY HAPPENED. WE'RE OFF THE FUCKING HOOK!
4447
TIME TO RELAX. LET'S ALL CRAWL INTO OUR COCOONS AND GET BUSY STIMULATING OUR AUTOEROGENOUS SHAME GLOBES.
4447
FIRST ONE TO START A WANK FIRE GETS A SHINY BOONDOLLAR.
4447
THIS IS AN ORDER FROM YOUR LEADER.
4447
LATER, FAG.
4447
TOO BAD THE ACRONYM WASN'T "HAG" INSTEAD, IT WOULD HAVE SUITED YOU MUCH BETTER.
4447
INSTEAD OF THAT NONSENSE WORD
4447
MAYBE ITS ASSOCIATION WITH YOU WILL COLLOQUIALLY CAUSE IT TO TAKE ON A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
4447
MAYBE FAG WILL BE "THE NEW BURN!" EVEN THOUGH IT REALLY MEANS NOTHING IN OUR LANGUAGE.
4447
I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS STUPID, FORGET IT
4447
OK I'M RAMBLING HERE, I'M AWARE OF THAT.
4447
FUTURE ME, DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE WEIGH IN ON THIS, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
4447
IF I WERE FUTURE ME, WHICH I GUESS I AM, I WOULD READ THIS AND BE ALL OVER IT, LIKE DAMMIT KARKAT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING.
4447
GET TO THE POINT.
4447
YEAH PRETTY MUCH.
4447
SO I'M SAYING IT TO MYSELF ALREADY HERE AND NOW, SO I WON'T HAVE TO LATER, GOT IT YOU TRENCHANT BACKBITING PRICKS?????
4447
DAMN, I'M LOSING MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
4447
MAYBE I'LL PICK IT UP AGAIN IN A FRESH MEMO LATER.
4447
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT THOUGH, BECAUSE I VAGUELY REMEMBER THIS ONE BEING LONGER THAN THIS.
4447
OH SON OF A BITCH.
4447
YOU PEOPLE ARE IMBECILES.
4447
ALL OF YOU.
4447
I AM NOT POSTING THESE MEMOS TO COUNSEL YOU ON YOUR PAST AND FUTURE DATING PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4447
WHY ARE YOU ALL SUCH BASKET CASES. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE.
4447
SHOULD I BAN YOU? WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT ANYMORE! ONE OF YOU STOOGES WILL BE RIGHT ON THE LAST ONES HEELS WITH ANOTHER SOB STORY.
4447
JUST
4447
HURRY UP AND TELL ME WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS BRO.
4447
OH NO SHIT REALLY???
4447
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN.
4447
THIS IS SO FUCKED UP, WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO.
4447
GOD, ACTUALLY I REMEMBER READING THIS BULLSHIT.
4447
OR SKIMMING IT AT LEAST.
4447
HOW COULD I FORGET???
4447
MORE LOONEYBLOCK THEATER, AND HERE I AM DRAWING THE CURTAINS FOR YOU GUYS LIKE A DOPE.
4447
OK WELL, I CAN ADVISE YOU AND STUFF
4447
BUT YOU DO REALIZE THIS IS A PUBLIC BULLETIN.
4447
WE SHOULD BE HAVING THIS CHAT IN PRIVATE.
4447
EVERYONE CAN READ THIS, EVEN HER.
4447
I MEAN FUCK, SHE WAS *JUST HERE* TALKING YOU DUMMY!
4447
WELL, FINE, IF YOU WANT TO BROADCAST A TRANSTIMELINE APOLOGY THEN FINE.
4447
BUT YOU SHOULD REALIZE THE FUTURE IS KIND OF A WIDE OPEN THING, I MEAN SHE COULD READ THIS LIKE TWO MINUTES IN THE FUTURE AS WELL AS 600 HOURS.
4447
AT THAT POINT YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE TALKING TO PRESENT HER, COMPLETELY DEFEATING THE PURPOSE OF YOUR SPINELESS MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE APOLOGY.
4447
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.
4447
OK WHATEVER. MY MEMO, BUT WHATEVER.
4447
OH GOD
4447
THIS IS
4447
COMPLETELY HILARIOUS.
4447
NOW I SEE WHY EVERYONE HAS BEEN RIPPING ON MY MEMOS.
4447
FUCK, ENOUGH ALREADY.
4447
THERE, GREAT, ANOTHER HAPPY COUPLE
4447
IN WHATEVER HIDEOUS QUADRANT THIS BATSHIT PAIRING WILL SUSTAIN.
4447
NOW OFF YOU GO.
4447
HOLY HELL.
4447
THIS IS EXHAUSTING.
4447
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE.
4447
OK, MAYBE I'LL TAKE A MINUTE TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS AND GET BACK ON TOPIC HERE.
4447
NO YOU WON'T.
4447
THIS ONE WAS PARTICULARLY NAUSEATING IN RETROSPECT, I'M SHUTTING THIS DOWN.
4467
FINE THEN.
4467
SINCE PAST ME JUST BANNED CURRENT ME FROM THE PRECEDING MEMO
4467
AND DOESN'T APPEAR TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY FUTURE WISDOM, AS USUAL
4467
LOOKS LIKE I'LL JUST HAVE TO START ANOTHER MEMO FROM SCRATCH.
4467
HEY PAST ME, GO HAVE A BLAST KILLING THE KING, I'M SURE IT WILL BE AWESOME.
4467
IN FACT, IT WAS AWESOME. BANG UP JOB WITH THAT, DUDE!
4467
TOO BAD IT WAS ALL A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.
4467
OH, WHAT'S THAT, PASTHOLE? YOU DIDN'T READ THIS AND FIGURE THAT OUT AHEAD OF TIME?
4467
OR MAYBE YOU JUST SKIMMED THIS AND IT DIDN'T GET THROUGH YOUR THICK BULGE???
4467
WHAT A SHOCK!
4467
MEMO-WITHIN-MEMO TO PRESENT SELF: PUT FORTH A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT TO IMPRESS UPON EVERYONE IN THE PAST, MYSELF INCLUDED, WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS THEY ALL ARE.
4467
I AM LEARNING A VALUABLE LESSON TODAY!
4467
IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T ALTER THE OUTCOME OF DECISIONS MADE BY MORONS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU YELL AT THEM.
4467
ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS GIVE THEM A HARD TIME AND TRY TO MAKE THEIR LIVES JUST A LITTLE MORE MISERABLE.
4467
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MORE NOBLE PURSUIT THAN CHANGING DESTINY FOR THE BETTER ANYWAY, FRANKLY.
4467
LOSERS SHOULD BE FORCED TO FACE THE MUSIC, EVEN FOR THE MISTAKES THEY HAVEN'T MADE YET.
4467
THEIR PUNISHMENT IS BEING ALLOWED TO MAKE THE MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. TALK ABOUT POETIC JUSTICE!
4467
AND THEN GETTING SOUNDLY BERATED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE MISTAKES ARE BEING MADE IS JUST THE MUCUS ON THE GRUBLOAF.
4467
THE SWEET, TANGY MUCUS.
4467
THIS IS DUMB.
4467
WHY DID I EVER THINK THESE MEMOS WERE GOING TO BE A GOOD IDEA.
4467
NOBODY CARES
4467
I MEAN
4467
NOBODY'S EVEN TROLLING ME ANYMORE.
4467
AND I'M LEAVING MYSELF WIDE OPEN TOO, SAYING SOME PRETTY DUMB THINGS HERE.
4467
I GUESS MAYBE I WROTE TOO MANY.
4467
AND FILLED TOO MANY OF THEM WITH LONG ARGUMENTS WITH MYSELF.
4467
NO ONE'S GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL THIS, ALL THE VALUABLE INFORMATION IS JUST GETTING LOST IN THE YELLING.
4467
YOU STUPID STUPID IDIOT.
4467
OH FUCK YOU, WHY'D YOU EVEN START ANOTHER MEMO THEN??
4467
I GUESS
4467
THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO GET OFF MY CHEST, OK?
4467
OH GOD, NOW I'M ARGUING WITH CURRENT ME.
4467
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE I WAS DOING IT, THIS IS REALLY FUCKED UP.
4467
I'VE GOT TO PULL IT TOGETHER.
4467
THINK BACK TO WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE WRONG.
4467
BUT THE THING IS
4467
AS MUCH AS OUR PAST SELVES ARE A BUNCH OF STUBBORN UNLISTENING ASSHOLES
4467
I CAN'T EVEN REALLY IDENTIFY ANY MISTAKES WE MADE.
4467
IT WAS ALL PRETTY MUCH LIKE CLOCKWORK.
4467
A 600 HOUR CAMPAIGN TO COMPLETE A GAME LIKE THIS IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME.
4467
AND I HAVE ASKED ME.
4467
IT TURNS OUT ME AGREES.
4467
I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
4467
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN OUR SESSION.
4467
SOLLUX HAS THE SAME INTUITION ABOUT IT AS ME, HE THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING FII2HY ABOUT IT.
4467
IT'S REALLY INSUFFERABLE THE WAY HER FISH PUNS HAVE RUBBED OFF ON HIM, IT KIND OF MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT.
4467
ANYWAY
4467
HE SAYS HE'S WORKING ON TRACING THE ORIGIN OF THIS DISASTER.
4467
IF I FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
4467
I WILL
4467
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.
4467
WASTE OF GOOD FRESH RAGE.
4467
I'M A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THE OLD THINGS I'VE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT.
4467
IT'S GOTTEN SO STALE.
4467
IN A WEIRD WAY I'M SORT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOMETHING NEW TO BE PISSED OFF ABOUT.
4467
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO LIVE FOR NOW ANYWAY.
4467
SO I'M KEEPING MY PRONGS CROSSED.
4467
IT WILL BE LIKE FUCKING 12TH PERIGEE'S EVE UP IN HERE.
4467
LAST SWEEP'S EVE WAS PROBABLY THE LAST HAPPY MEMORY I HAVE IN FACT.
4467
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO FOR THE LAST HOLIDAY?
4467
ANYONE?
4467
I REMEMBER MY LUSUS HAD BEEN GONE FOR DAYS AND I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED.
4467
BUT THEN HE FINALLY RETURNED, TRIUMPHANT.
4467
HE BROUGHT THE FRESH BEHEMOTH LEAVING INTO OUR HIVE, AND TOGETHER WE DECORATED IT.
4467
AND
4467
I DUNNO
4467
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY, I'M GETTING A LUMP IN MY SQUAWK BLISTER.
4467
I GUESS I'M DONE.
4467
I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN NOW
4467
ON THE STEEL FLOOR OF THIS FRIGID METEOR DRIFTING THROUGH THE BLACK UNCARING VOID OF OUR NULL SESSION.
4467
NULL, KIND OF LIKE THIS MEMO I GUESS.
4467
LATER.
4467
WHOA, HEY
4467
WHAT?
4467
OH
4467
THAT'S COOL.
4467
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE RESPONDED TO A MEMO THAT I CAN RECALL.
4467
YOU TOOK IT RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE THIS THING.
4467
PRETTY MUCH.
4467
FOR A WHILE IT WAS FRUSTRATING.
4467
WHEN I DISCOVERED THE FEATURE I KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH ALL MY FUTURE MEMOS, NOT REALLY READING ALL OF THEM CAREFULLY OR THOROUGHLY.
4467
THEN I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN, AND THE WHOLE BOARD WAS GONE.
4467
BECAUSE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO I DID.
4467
AND THEN I KEPT MAKING MEMOS WITH ONLY FOGGY RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED.
4467
WHILE ALL THESE OTHER CHUMPS FROM DIFFERENT TIMES KEPT GIVING ME SHIT.
4467
INCLUDING MYSELF.
4467
BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD, BECAUSE AS I EVENTUALLY BECAME MY OWN FUTURE SELVES, AND GOT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDES OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.
4467
AND COULD DO MY PAST SELVES THE SERVICE OF INFORMING THEM HOW STUPID THEY WERE BEING.
4467
I STOPPED BOTHERING TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW ANY OF THESE MEMOS WENT.
4467
HONESTLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN A BLUR TO ME, JUST NON STOP YELLING AT MYSELF, HAGGLING WITH PAST AND FUTURE KNUCKLEHEADS, KILLING MONSTERS AND SOLVING PUZZLES, CYCLING THROUGH ALL THE GATES AND PLANETS LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES, ZIGZAGGING DOWN TO THE BATTLEFIELD, OUT TO THE VEIL, OVER TO PROSPIT, BACK TO DERSE, AND ON AND ON AND ON LIKE THAT UNTIL WE THOUGHT WE WON.
4467
BUT WE DIDN'T WIN. WE LOST.
4467
WE LOST AS HARD AS FAT GUYS FALL.
4467
DID YOU READ THE MEMO JUST BEFORE THIS?
4467
GIVE IT A READ, I'M DONE RANTING ABOUT ALL THAT FOR NOW.
4467
BUT YEAH, THAT'S HOW TROLLIAN'S TIMELINE STUFF WORKS. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
4467
OR NOT! SINCE APPARENTLY THIS IS YOUR ONLY MEMO REPLY. YOU WERE PRETTY SHREWD IN SIDESTEPPING THIS WHOLE CLUSTERFUCK.
4467
THEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.
4467
HELL YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAID OF TIME THAN THE ONE WE WERE STUCK WITH.
4467
SHE'S COMPLETELY SHITHIVE MAGGOTS, DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.
4467
SURE YOU DO.
4467
OR, YOU WILL. TRUST ME YOU'LL DO FINE.
4467
SO WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO RESPOND ANYWAY.
4467
I MEAN ASIDE FROM BEING STRONGARMED BY CONVERSATIONAL PREDESTINATION.
4467
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE.
4467
DO YOU REMEMBER IF THIS MEMO WAS MUCH LONGER THAN THIS?
4467
THEN MIGHT AS WELL SPIT IT OUT.
4467
RED OR BLACK?
4467
YOUR PROBLEM, DOES IT PERTAIN TO REDROM OR BLACKROM INTERESTS?
4467
COME ON. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THESE MEMOS TO SIFT THROUGH THEIR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS, I AM A FUCKING VETERAN AT THIS SHIT BY NOW.
4467
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T MIND, IT'LL BE A WELCOME REPRIEVE FROM SHOUTING AT MYSELF.
4467
DIDN'T YOU AT LEAST GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT WHEN YOU SKIMMED IT?
4467
YES I COMPLETELY AGREE.
4467
IT'S GOOD YOU DIDN'T READ IT. WE CAN AVOID THE SORT OF VERBAL SLAPSTICK ROUTINES I'M SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF BY NOW.
4467
I AM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE BEING ALL COY AND TELLING ME WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SAY BEFORE WE SAY IT, AND THEN WE WIND UP FUCKING SAYING IT ANYWAY.
4467
AND THEN WE PROVE TO THE INVISIBLE RIDDLER THAT IS FATHER TIME BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS WE ALL ARE.
4467
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD THAT GETS AFTER A WHILE?
4467
SO REALLY, TELL ME.
4467
I KNOW IT'S ON YOUR MIND, I GOT A SENSE FOR THESE THINGS.
4467
R OR B???
4467
HAHA, WELL ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE CASE?
4467
STORY AS OLD AS TIME.
4467
EVEN IN PLACES WHERE STRICTLY SPEAKING TIME DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL RECENTLY.
4467
WHO'S THE TARGET OF THESE FLUSHED LEANINGS?
4467
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.
4467
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S READING.
4467
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE ELSE JOIN IN LATER?
4467
SEE
4467
NOBODY CARES ENOUGH TO BOTHER.
4467
WELL I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
4467
THEIR DISINTEREST IS MORE A REFLECTION ON ME THAN YOU.
4467
SHE? WELL I GUESS THAT NARROWS IT DOWN SOMEWHAT.
4467
IF I THINK BACK ON EVENTS KNOWING THIS I COULD PROBABLY PIECE IT TOGETHER...
4467
ALRIGHT, DEAL.
4467
WHAT
4467
NO OF COURSE NOT.
4467
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THAT MUCH.
4467
I JUST KNOW THIS STUFF WILL DRIVE YOU SHITHIVE MAGGOTS IF YOU DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.
4467
LIKE
4467
NOT THAT I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE A SHIT BUT PERSONALLY I AM ALL TWISTED UP ABOUT BLACKROM STUFF ESPECIALLY.
4467
HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I WAS CUT OUT TO HAVE A KISMESIS, I THINK MY STANDARDS ARE WAY TOO HIGH.
4467
DID YOU KNOW THAT...
4467
THIS FEELS SO INSANE TO ADMIT, BUT
4467
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS ADVENTURE, AT TIMES I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO SUSPECT I WAS MY OWN KISMESIS.
4467
HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT???
4467
BUT OBVIOUSLY ITS NOT TRUE, I NEVER EVEN DID ANY LEGIT TIME TRAVELING WHERE I COULD MEET MYSELF, I JUST BICKERED WITH PAST AND FUTURE GHOSTS ON A CHAT CLIENT.
4467
FITTING REALLY. EVERY CALIGINOUS ADVERSARY I'VE CONTEMPLATED HAS ELUDED ME LIKE A PHANTOM, EVEN MYSELF!
4467
WHATEVER, I'M DONE WITH IT.
4467
NO NO NO I'M NOT AIRING THAT SHIT OUT HERE.
4467
MAYBE PRIVATELY.
4467
IT'S PRIVATE.
4467
LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT, WHAT WERE YOU ORIGINALLY GOING TO ASK ME.
4467
UH...
4467
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT'S KIND OF THE DUMBEST FUCKING QUESTION I'VE EVER HEARD.
4467
YOU PUT WAY TOO MUCH STOCK IN THAT RATTY OLD GUIDE.
4467
BUT ANYWAY NO, WE NEVER USED MAGIC.
4467
I MEAN, LET ME TRY TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW RIDICULOUS THE WHOLE NOTION IS ANYWAY.
4467
WE CAN ALCHEMIZE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING WITH THE RIGHT MATERIALS AND GRIST.
4467
WE CAN, AND DID, MAKE SUPER POWERFUL WEAPONS AND ITEMS THAT CAN DO PRACTICALLY ANYTHING.
4467
WHAT ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE COULD MAGIC OFFER? ALL THIS SHIT IS PRACTICALLY MAGIC ANYWAY.
4467
BUT MORE LIKE
4467
GOOFY SCIENCEY MAGIC. YOU KNOW?
4467
BUT EVERYTHING HERE IS KIND OF MAGIC IN A WAY, ISN'T IT.
4467
FORTUNE TELLING DREAM CLOUDS AND GOLDEN MOONS AND SHIT.
4467
IF YOU LOOK AROUND
4467
THERE'S MAGIC EVERYWHERE IN THIS BITCH.
4467
IT'S ALL AROUND US.
4467
MOTHER FUCKIN MIRACLES, RIGHT?
4467
WHAT DO YOU NEED MAGIC FOR ANYWAY?
4467
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
4467
AND YOU WON'T NEED MAGIC, TRUST ME.
4467
JUST BE PATIENT, THE ANSWER WILL COME TO YOU SOMEHOW.
4467
YEAH, REALLY THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
4467
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE DETAILS OF THE ADVENTURE GO.
4467
WE WERE ALL PRETTY AWESOME AT THIS GAME.
4467
REALLY AWESOME IN FACT.
4467
UNTIL A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
4467
WHEN IT TURNED OUT WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY ALL THAT AWESOME.
4467
TURNS OUT WE WERE PRETTY FUCKING UNAWESOME ALL ALONG.
4467
WELL
4467
FOR STARTERS
4467
HAVE YOU SCROLLED UP TO THE TOP OF THE TIMELINES YET?
4467
CHECK THAT OUT
4467
MAYBE READ A FEW RECENT MEMOS
4467
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH.
4467
JUST DEAL WITH GETTING THROUGH THE QUEST.
4467
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU CATCH UP WITH ME ON THE TIMELINE.
4467
WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT NOW.
4467
OK I PROBABLY WON'T DO THAT, BUT ALRIGHT HA HA.
4467
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE ANYWAY?
4467
YEAH.
4467
YOU'RE MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR CHAINSAW.
4467
WHILE TAVROS IS SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.
4467
OH GOD.
4467
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK WHAT ARE YOU DOING???????
4474
OK I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
4474
THANKS FOR NOT HASSLING ME ABOUT IT IN ONE OF THE MEMOS TO GET MY ATTENTION, I APPRECIATE THAT.
4474
UNLESS YOU DID, BUT IT WAS IN A FUTURE MEMO I HAVEN'T WRITTEN YET, IN WHICH CASE HAVE A BIGTIME FUCK YOU ABOUT THAT IN ADVANCE.
4474
POSTING IN THEM AT ALL IS THE REASON. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO REPLY MEMOS PERIOD, THAT'S THE REASON.
4474
SOUNDS LAME.
4474
YEAH I GOT THAT.
4474
THIS IS AN EMPTY THREAT, BECAUSE IF YOU MADE A BOARD AT ANY POINT ON THE TIMELINE I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT RIGHT HERE AND READ THE WHOLE THING ALREADY.
4474
WAIT...
4474
OH GOD, YOU ACTUALLY DID.
4474
LOOK I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRUITY RUMPUS ASSHOLE FACTORY.
4474
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT GOING AFTER THE QUEEN'S RING.
4474
BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO PULL OFF REGISURP WITH JACK.
4474
WHY DON'T WE TAKE IT ONE MISSION AT A TIME.
4474
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT, JACK'S AN ALLY.
4474
THIS IS BULLSHIT.
4474
WE'RE NOT EXILING JACK, HE'S COOL.
4474
YES HE IS, HE'S A TOTAL BADASS WITH A FUCK TON OF BLADES AND SHIT, AND HE'S HELPING US OUT.
4474
STINKS?
4474
LET ME ACTED SHOCKED LIKE I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
4474
O:
4474
FUCK I FORGOT MY HORNS, I ALWAYS FORGET THEM
4474
O:B
4474
WHAT A SURPRISE, YOU ARE DRAGGING YOUR SCHIZOPHRENIC NOSE INTO THIS, WHAT AN OUTSTANDING CHARACTER WITNESS.
4474
OBJECTION YOUR TYRANNY! HAHAHA
4474
THE BOTTOM LINE IS I AM NOT GOING TO EXILE JACK BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN SMELL MALICE OFF AN INTERPRETIVE DANCE.
4474
SOME OF THOSE STABBINGS WERE ACCIDENTAL!
4474
OK, WELL I KNOW FOR A FACT THE THIRD TIME WAS ACCIDENTAL.
4474
ANYWAY YOU'VE BEATEN THE SHIT OUT OF ME A FEW TIMES YOURSELF.
4474
HEY I PROMISED I'D TELL YOU.
4474
I JUST
4474
WASN'T READY OK
4474
NO YOU DON'T
4474
LIES, I'VE BEEN VERY CAREFUL.
4474
NOT LIKE ALL YOU CLASSLESS SHITBAGS WHO SLOP YOUR BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE EVERY GODDAMN MINUTE LIKE IT'S SOME WEIRD FETISH.
4474
WHAT
4474
WHAT IS IT?
4474
ARE YOU LICKING YOUR GLASSES AGAIN?
4474
I HATE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT, IT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING.
4475
YES, I'M EXTREMELY FAMILIAR WITH THIS SORT OF NONSENSE BY NOW, SURE.
4475
WHAT
4475
WHO TOLD YOU
4475
DID JACK TELL YOU
4475
HOW
4475
NO
4475
I CLEANED UP MY WOUND AND CHANGED MY SHIRT BEFORE I EVEN MET YOU, I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CAREFUL.
4475
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FILL ME IN.
4475
WHOA
4475
YOU MEAN
4475
DURING
4475
FUCK.
4475
OK SHHHHHHHHHH SHH SHH SHH...
4475
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THIS, NOT HERE.
4475
I KNOW BUT
4475
DAMMIT
4475
WRITING ALL THESE MEMOS HAS MADE ME PARANOID.
4475
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL SECURE CHATTING ABOUT IT OVER THE CLIENT, I DUNNO.
4475
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT IN PERSON.
4475
THOSE ARE EYEBROWS?
4475
I THOUGHT THEY WERE HORNS.
4475
?:B
4475
WELL APPARENTLY I JUST CAN'T FUCKING HELP MYSELF CAN I.
4475
HOW CAN YOU EVEN SMELL SO DAMN WELL, ANYWAY.
4475
YOU GIVE ME A HARD TIME ABOUT BEING COY ABOUT SHIT
4475
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CRAZY SENSES YOU'RE SO VAGUE, IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DECIPHER THE DAILY HOROSCOPE RIDDLE.
4475
OR THE RIDDLES FOR ALL 48 SIGNS COMBINED.
4475
LOOK
4475
WE'LL TALK
4475
I PROMISE
4475
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY SOME STUFF ABOUT YOURSELF FOR A CHANGE
4475
AND CUT ME SOME SLACK.
4476
YEAH, BUT IT'S STILL SO VAGUE.
4476
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.
4476
HOW ABOUT A STRAIGHT ANSWER?
4476
YOU MEAN ON PROSPIT'S MOON.
4476
WHY IS THAT.
4476
IS IT OUT OF SPITE TO VRISKA?
4476
I KNOW I'D PROBABLY BE COOL WITH IT OUT OF SPITE MORE THAN ANYTHING.
4476
OK, SO WHY DID YOU NEVER TELL ME ANY OF THIS?
4476
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP.
4476
HOW MANY OF US ARE AWAKE NOW?
4476
HOW MUCH OF THE FUTURE DID YOU "SEE" BEFORE WE STARTED
4476
IN THE CLOUDS, LIKE KANAYA
4476
ALSO HOW DID YOU GO BLIND ANYWAY???
4476
WHAT DID SHE DO TO YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO CAGEY ABOUT THAT.
4476
I STILL DON'T SEE HOW SHE COULD BLIND YOU WITHOUT BEING ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.
4476
OBVIOUSLY SHE CAN'T CONTROL YOU, SO WHAT GIVES?
4476
WAIT LET ME GUESS.
4476
DO I LOOK ADORABLE?????????
4476
WOW, WHAT THE FUCK.
4476
OH
4476
THEN
4476
GOOD I GUESS
4476
WAIT
4476
TEREZI
4476
PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT MY BLOOD.
4476
I WANT TO TELL THEM, I MEAN I WILL TELL THEM.
4476
LATER
4476
ONCE THEY RESPECT ME AS A LEADER.
4476
BYE
4476
<3
4528
ATTENTION WORTHLESS HUMAN.
4528
THIS IS YOUR GOD SPEAKING.
4528
IT IS A WRATHFUL GOD WHO DESPISES YOU MORE THAN YOU COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DARED TO FEAR.
4528
I HAVE WATCHED YOUR ENTIRE PATHETIC LIFE UNFOLD.
4528
I HAVE OBSERVED YOU WHILE YOU WOULD QUAKE AND TREMBLE IN PERSONAL PRAYERS OF SHAME.
4528
WHILE YOU PLEADED FORGIVENESS FOR BEING SUCH A WRETCHED DISGUSTING FAILURE ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE LEVEL.
4528
PROSTRATE BEFORE THE STUPID AND FALSE CLOWN GODS YOU HAVE SCRIBBLED ON THE WALLS OF YOUR BLOCK.
4528
BOGUS DEITIES WORSHIPED BY A PRIMITIVE "PARADISE" PLANET.
4528
BUT YOUR PRAYERS WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.
4528
THERE ARE NO MIRACLES IN STORE FOR YOU, HUMAN.
4528
ONLY MY HATE.
4528
IT IS A HATE SO PURE AND HOT IT WOULD CONSUME YOUR SAD UNDERDEVELOPED HUMAN THINK PAN TO EVEN CONTEMPLATE.
4528
IT IS A HATE THAT TO FATHOM MUST BE PUT INTO SONG.
4528
SHRIEKED BY THE TEN THOUSAND ROWDY SHOUT SPHINCTERS PEPPERING THE GRUESOME UNDERBELLY OF THE MOST TRUCULENT GOD THE FURTHEST RING CAN MUSTER.
4528
IT IS A HATE THAT MADE YOU AND WILL SURELY DESTROY YOU.
4528
MY HATE IS THE LIFEBLOOD THAT PULSES THROUGH THE VEINS OF YOUR UNIVERSE.
4528
IT IS MY GIFT TO YOU.
4528
YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THAT.
4528
YOU UNGRATEFUL PIECE OF SHIT.
4528
WHAT
4528
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME.
4528
WHAT IS IT.
4528
ME HATING YOU IS WHAT'S IT.
4528
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN, YEAH, BINGO.
4528
YEAH.
4528
ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE'VE SPOKEN BEFORE.
4528
JOHN, WHY WOULD I GIVE A PUNGENT WHIPPING LUMPSQUIRT WHAT YOUR NAME IS.
4528
I ADMIT I AM NEW TO HUMAN SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS
4528
BUT I REFUSE TO BELIEVE OUR RELATIONSHIP CAN OR WILL EVER BE DESCRIBED AS "EARTH HUMAN BUDDIES".
4528
THESE ARE LIES.
4528
I KNOW WHEN I AM BEING TROLLED, WHO DO YOU EVEN THINK YOU ARE TALKING TO HERE.
4528
I AM YOUR GOD, REMEMBER.
4528
WHY WOULD I TROLL YOU BACKWARDS? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE.
4528
AND WHY WOULD I HELP YOU AND YOUR IDIOT FRIENDS?
4528
I WOULD JUST BE HELPING YOU BLUNDER DOWN THE PATH THAT ENDS WITH YOU OPENING THE RIFT LIKE A BUNCH OF MORONS.
4528
WHATEVER.
4528
RIDICULOUS.
4528
I DIDN'T WRIGGLE OUT OF A PUDDLE OF SLIME YESTERDAY.
4528
THAT WAS SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, OK?
4528
I DO NOT THINK YOU APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF MY ANTIPATHY, JOHN HUMAN.
4528
OK, HUMAN EGBERT.
4528
I FUCKING LOATHE YOU, AND I HAVE TUNED INTO YOUR CHANNEL MOMENTS BEFORE THE ERADICATION OF YOUR TIMELINE AND THAT SMUG LOOK ON YOUR FACE, WITH JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO BASICALLY COMPLETELY FUCKING DESTROY YOU WITH HOSTILE RHETORIC.
4528
THERE IS NO CHANCE I WILL EVER HELP YOU.
4528
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I HATE YOU OR WHY I HATE YOU.
4528
I WASN'T JOKING WHEN I SAID I WAS YOUR GOD, LIKE THAT WASN'T JUST A LOT OF BRAVADO AND USELESS PISSING AROUND.
4528
I AM LITERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE.
4528
WE BEAT THE GAME YOU ARE PLAYING AND CREATED YOUR UNIVERSE.
4528
WE WERE GOING TO ENTER YOUR UNIVERSE AND RULE OVER IT.
4528
LIKE TYRANTS.
4528
IT WAS TO BE OUR PLAYTHING, JOHN.
4528
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SWEET IT WAS GOING TO BE.
4528
BUT THEN WE COULDN'T CLAIM OUR PRIZE BECAUSE OF THAT MONSTROSITY YOU SPRUNG ON US.
4528
STUTID?
4528
WOW, YOUR SPECIES REALLY IS BRAINDEAD.
4528
YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO TROLL YOU?
4528
I MEAN
4528
DON'T WORRY, I CAN AND I WILL, AND IT WILL BE A GODDAMN BLOODBATH WHEN I GET STARTED.
4528
IT'S JUST KIND OF WEIRD YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT, IS THAT NORMAL FOR YOUR RACE?
4528
THAT'S REALLY CONDESCENDING AND IT'S HARD TO CONVEY HOW MUCH MORE I JUST GOT PISSED OFF THAN I ALREADY WAS.
4528
BUT MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE ACTUALLY
4528
THAT YOU WELCOME MY ACRIMONY SO READILY
4528
ON ACCOUNT OF PROBABLY SOME WEIRD GLAND HUMANS HAVE, LIKE A PUNISHMENT THROBBER OR SOME SILLY SOUNDING THING LIKE THAT.
4528
IT MIGHT MEAN THAT I'M RIGHT ABOUT YOU.
4528
I MEAN THAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY, DON'T YOU THINK JOHN.
4528
SORT OF COSMICALLY.
4528
LIKE OUR HATE FOR EACH OTHER IS SO STRONG IT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE STARS.
4528
YOU KNOW, THE ONES I FUCKING MADE FOR YOU.
4528
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY CLAIM TO HAVE TALKED TO ME A LOT ALREADY AND NOT HATE ME, SEE IT DOESN'T ADD UP.
4528
WHAT, NO.
4528
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR, THAT WOULD BE SUCH A BRAZEN SOLICITATION.
4528
IT'S INSULTING.
4528
I MEAN
4528
OK I'M NOT SAYING I'M RULING OUT THE IDEA OR ANYTHING.
4528
LIKE IF LATER OVER TIME YOU STARTED REALLY HATING ME MORE
4528
LIKE REALLY GOT TO KNOW ME AND FOUND OUT ABOUT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TO HATE
4528
BUT... IN THE PAST I GUESS? I'M JUST SAYING WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN.
4528
OR HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.
4528
FUCK WHAT AM I BABBLING ABOUT.
4528
THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS, WE JUST MET FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
4528
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE EVER GOING TO MEET IN PERSON, SO IT'S ALL A MOOT POINT.
4528
SO FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.
4528
GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
4528
WHAT FEELINGS, THERE ARE NO FEELINGS, END OF DISCUSSION.
4528
WHAT
4528
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
4528
HUMANS HAVE A WORD FOR THAT?
4528
HOW IS THAT EVEN A THING?
4528
HUMAN ROMANCE SURE IS WEIRD.
4528
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A THING.
4528
YOU ARE SUCH AN IGNORAMUS I COULD SHIT MILES OF RAGE SNAKE TO CHOKE YOU TO DEATH.
4528
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT.
4528
OK FIRST OF ALL, IF THERE WERE A "THING" WITH HER, AND THAT'S A HUGE IF
4528
IT WOULD BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT QUADRANT THAN WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.
4528
SECOND, WHETHER SHE AND I HAVE A THING OR DON'T HAVE A THING, OR TOOK A ROMANTIC HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE SUSPENDED IN A GODDAMN FILIAL PAIL TOGETHER
4528
IT'S DEFINITELY NONE OF YOUR FUCKING EARTH BUSINESS, EGBERT HUMAN JOHN.
4528
GOT IT????????
4528
YEAH
4528
WOW, IT IS
4528
HUH.
4528
OK, LOOK.
4528
LET'S JUST AGREE TO NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN.
4528
THE STUFF I WAS BABBLING ABOUT EARLIER.
4528
BUT IF I TALK TO YOU AGAIN
4528
IN YOUR FUTURE, LIMITED THOUGH IT IS
4528
YOU'LL REMEMBER MY EMBARRASSING SHIT
4528
SO I GUESS
4528
I'LL HAVE TO TROLL YOU BACKWARDS?
4528
YOU REALLY ARE A SMUG NOOK WHIFFER, JOHN EGBERT.
4528
I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK ON POINT HERE.
4528
WHICH IS ADDRESSING THE MATTER OF WHAT INCOMPREHENSIBLY PUTRID GARBAGE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE AND HOW MUCH I HATE YOU.
4528
SHUT THE FUCK UP, WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THAT, REMEMBER.
4528
SO YOU WANTED TO GET TROLLED, WELL YOU GOT IT.
4528
PREPARE TO GET YOUR PUNY HUMAN BULGE FLAMED INTO NUCLEAR HATEBLIVION.
4528
WELCOME TO THE TROLLOCAUST. THE PAINSTAKING GENOCIDE OF YOUR FRAGILE SELF ESTEEM WILL BE MY SWAN SONG.
4528

4594
AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, WHY DON'T YOU COME SAY IT TO MY FACE.
4594
I'M FED UP WITH THESE BACK DOOR NOOKBITING SHENANIGANS.
4594
OK, WHAT IS IT?
4594
YES. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
4594
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BOTH?
4594
WHY DOES IT MATTER.
4594
GOD DAMMIT.
4594
NO MORE MYSTERIES, PLEASE.
4594
YOU'D THINK WE'D HAD OUR FILL OF THEM BY NOW.
4594
IF I HAVE TO SOLVE ONE MORE RIDDLE, I'M GOING TO...
4594
I DON'T KNOW.
4594
NO
4594
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
4594
I WILL JUST GO OVER THERE AND WEEP GENTLY IN THE HORN PILE.
4594
SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
4594
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS
4594
THEY ARE ALL LUDICROUSLY INCOMPETENT.
4594
SOFT, PINK FRAGILE THINGS WHO DO NOTHING BUT WASTE TIME.
4594
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE HORNS!
4594
YEAH, I WAS LIKE, WHOA DID THEY GET FILED DOWN OR SOMETHING
4594
BUT NO IT TURNS OUT THAT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE.
4594
THEY'RE A MISERABLE POINTLESS CROP OF LIFEFORMS FROM A MEANINGLESS BORING PUSTULE OF A PLANET.
4594
IT'S INFURIATING THEY WERE SOMEHOW ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER US.
4594
YEP.
4594
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.
4594
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
4594
YOU'RE BEING REALLY WEIRD ABOUT THIS.
4594
THEN ASK!!!
4594
YEAH. THAT'S THE ROSE HUMAN.
4594
SHE'S APPARENTLY PRETTY SARCASTIC.
4594
IT'S IN MY NOTES.
4594
YES.
4594
NO, I'M YOUR LEADER BECAUSE OF MY INCREDIBLE TACTICAL SKILLS AND MY ABILITY TO MOBILIZE AND MOTIVATE A BUNCH OF USELESS PEOPLE TOWARD A COMMON GOAL, AND BECAUSE I'M EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND INTREPID. ALSO BECAUSE LEADERSHIP IS IN MY BLOOD. WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
4594
OK, I'LL ACCEPT THAT.
4594
WHO
4594
OF COURSE WE DO.
4594
IT SOUNDS SUITABLY DISDAINFUL.
4594
I MEAN, IF A BUNCH OF ALIENS STARTED HASSLING YOU, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO ACT REALLY HIGH AND MIGHTY, AND SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY, RIGHT?.
4594
WHICH WE ARE, OF COURSE.
4594
AND NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER.
4594
I WILL PROBABLY STEER CLEAR OF HER FOR THE MOST PART.
4594
I HAVE MY SIGHTS SET ON THE JOHN HUMAN, AND PROBABLY ALSO THE JADE HUMAN, SHE'S A HUGE CULPRIT TOO.
4594
WE HAVE TO COMMIT TO THIS. STAY IN CHARACTER, YOU KNOW?
4594
REMEMBER THE SPEECH.
4594
DID YOU WANT TO TROLL HER? ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING?
4594
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE GREAT, I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
4594
COME ON. YOU'LL BE GREAT AT IT.
4594
PLEASE JUST DO THIS ONE THING FOR ME. WE'VE GOT TO STAY COORDINATED ON THIS.
4594
TOO MANY OF THESE FUCKS ARE GOING ROGUE.
4594
LIKE WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING.
4594
GREAT! THANKS KANAYA.
4594
I'LL EXPECT A FULL REPORT SOON.
4594
LIKE
4594
HOW HASSLED YOU GOT HER TO BE
4594
BUT LESS STUPID SOUNDING THAN THAT.
4594
NO
4594
WELL THERE COULD BE
4594
WE CAN GAUGE YOUR RESULTS WITH THE "FLIGHTY BROADS AND THEIR SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER".

4688
JOHN, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THIS IS OUR TEN MILLIONTH CONVERSATION.
4688
I WAS
4688
GOT BACK TO THE BEGINNING
4688
AND THEN JUMPED AHEAD AGAIN A BUNCH OF TIMES.
4688
STOP BEING SO LINEAR, IT'S GETTING OLD.
4688
NOW I NEED YOU TO JOIN THIS MEMO SO WE CAN DISCUSS SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
4688
CLICK THE AWESOME BANNER I MADE.
4689
HEY SHITHEAD YOU ARE IN HUGE TROUBLE.
4689
A WORD WITH YOU AND YOUR FRIEND.
4689
YES DAVE, I WAS ASLEEP AT ONE POINT.
4689
IT STANDS TO REASON I AM NOW AND WILL ALWAYS BE ASLEEP AT EVERY POINT ON ALL TIMELINES.
4689
THAT REALLY MAKES A LOT OF FUCKING SENSE.
4689
NOW YOU, ME, AND EGBERT NEED TO HAVE A CHAT.
4689
HERE I MADE A COOL BANNER USING SOME OF YOUR SHITTY EARTH CLIP ART.
4689
CLICK IT.
4689
IT'LL WORK, WON'T IT?
4751
HOLY SHIT, IT'S HARLEY
4751
COMMUNICATING WITH ME OUT OF NOWHERE OF HER OWN VOLITION
4751
HOLD THAT THOUGHT WHILE I GO INFORM MY DISGRACE OF A CLOWN FRIEND ABOUT THIS TRUE REAL LIFE MIRACLE, IT MIGHT LIFT HIS SPIRITS
4751
I HAVE TO SPREAD THE WICKED WORD LIKE I'M MASSAGING SHITTY SPARKLEDUST AROUND MY NETHER REGIONS TO ASSUAGE A VICIOUS RASH
4751
IT'S LIKE I'M SEASONING A FUCKING STEAK HERE.
4751
OH YEAH, BECAUSE TALKING TO YOU HAS JUST BEEN ABSOLUTE EUPHORIA.
4751
DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HEADACHES.
4751
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LUMBERJACK SPLITTING WOOD ON MY THINK PAN.
4751
HE'S GOT THE FOREARMS OF A CHOLERBEAR, A MOUNTAIN OF LOGS, AND NOTHING BUT FUCKING TIME.
4751
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
4751
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO CONTACT ME, NOT THAT I'M NOT TICKLED BY THE SURPRISE.
4751
LET'S CATCH UP. HOW IS EVERYTHING? HOW WAS YOUR DEATHNAP?? I CAN ONLY HOPE IT WAS AS REFRESHING AS MINE.
4751
WHAT'S THAT? HOW AM I? I'M GREAT, FEEL LIKE A MILLION BOONBANKS EVER SINCE MY LITTLE POWER SNOOZE.
4751
STILL PRETTY TIRED THOUGH. YOU LOOK A LITTLE DROWSY YOURSELF. BUT WE WON'T BE GOING BACK TO SLEEP ANY TIME SOON, WILL WE JADE?
4751
NO WAY. A PAIR OF FEISTY GOGETTERS LIKE YOU AND ME, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR DREAMS OF HORRORTERRORS FONDLING EVERY RECESS OF OUR NAKED PSYCHES, PLEASANT THOUGH THEY ARE.
4751
YOU HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT USELESS SCAMPERING AND GIGGLING TO DO. WHEREAS I HAVE A CRUCIAL DATE WITH A PNEUMATIC DRILL, TO BORE A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF MY FOREHEAD, DEEP INTO THE PLUMP ANGUISH BLADDER WHICH STORES MY ALIEN DISMAY FLUID. THAT'S A REAL THING WE HAVE, FYI.
4751
I WILL THEN PERFORM A LITTLE SOFT SHOE NUMBER IN THE PUDDLE OF FLUID THAT ACCUMULATES ON THE FLOOR, WHILE MAKING THE BIGGEST SMILE EVER ATTEMPTED BY SOMEONE NOT CLINICALLY RETARDED.
4751
I WILL DO THIS FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT, JADE. TO SAY THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
4751
TRY TO BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE
4751
TROLLING IS AN ACTIVITY THAT SHARES A NAME WITH MY ENTIRE SPECIES
4751
DO I GET ON YOUR CASE FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE HUMANNING YOU DO?
4751
TELL ME JADE
4751
WHY ARE YOU SUCH A RACIST?
4751
YES, EXACTLY.
4751
I AM A TROLL. IT SEEMS WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.
4751
WAIT
4751
OK LOOK
4751
I SERIOUSLY, HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
4751
YOU SAY YOUR ROBOT BLEW UP, AND THAT WAS SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO MESSAGE ME?
4751
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T CONTACT THE RIGHT ME.
4751
I MEAN FUTURE ME IS PROBABLY THE ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS.
4751
SINCE IT'S ALL NEWS TO ME.
4751
I DON'T PLAY PRANKS, THAT'S JUVENILE NONSENSE.
4751
I DO TWO THINGS AND TWO THINGS ONLY, I DEVASTATE SORRY MOTHERFUCKERS, AND GET SHIT DONE AS AN AWESOME LEADER.
4751
IN THIS CASE, I AM ACCOMPLISHING THE LATTER.
4751
HERE, CLICK THIS AND WE WILL SOLVE THE MYSTERY TOGETHER.
4752
HEY FUTURE ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS EXPLODED JADEBOT BUSINESS?
4752
MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY MISSION CRITICAL, OR JADE WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED GETTING IN TOUCH WITH US, RIGHT?
4752
SOMETHING IMPERATIVE TO OUR SURVIVAL NO DOUBT?
4752
HEY DOUCHE BAG, ARE YOU THERE
4752
PIPE DOWN HARLEY, THIS PRACTICALLY DOESN'T EVEN CONCERN YOU AT THIS POINT
4752
NOTHING TO SAY, FUTURE ME?
4752
NOT EVEN A FEW PARTING WORDS OF SCORN FOR ME OR THE NARCOLEPTIC IDIOT?
4752
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE'VE SPARRED, HOW I'VE MISSED THE SWEET STING OF YOUR BARBS
4752
HAHAHA YOU ARE SO DUMB YOU ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A RUSE.
4752
YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY AND YOU STILL DON'T GET THAT ALL THE SHIT WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT IS REAL.
4752
WHY THE FUCK WOULD I BE PULLING A STUNT LIKE THIS, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.
4752
I REALLY AM TALKING TO FUTURE ME, HE'S JUST BEING AN EVASIVE TOOL.
4752
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW BEHIND THE TIMES YOU ARE.
4752
IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'VE SLEPT THROUGH THIS WHOLE ADVENTURE
4752
OH WAIT, THAT IS ESSENTIALLY TRUE.
4752
IT WAS HILARIOUS WATCHING YOU GROW UP.
4752
YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD ALL THE ANSWERS, FROLICKING ALL OVER YOUR ISLAND BEING INFURIATINGLY CHIPPER, BUILDING ROBO-BUNNIES LIKE A MORON AND ULTIMATELY RUINING EVERYTHING.
4752
YOU WERE SO SURE YOUR DREAMS TOLD YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.
4752
AND NOW LOOK AT YOU
4752
YOU SUDDENLY UNDERSTAND JACK SHIT.
4752
DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I'M ANGRY AND STUBBORN.
4752
I FUCKING KNOW WHAT THOSE ASSETS MAKE POSSIBLE.
4752
THEY MADE YOU POSSIBLE, GOT IT???
4752
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO BE GRACED BY MY DIVINE FURY?
4752
TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF GETTING TO BE STUDIED AND MOCKED BY ME FOR YOUR WHOLE PATHETIC MISERABLE LIFE?
4752
DO YOU REALIZE I'M YOUR GOD? YES, YOUR LITERAL GOD, THAT'S RIGHT.
4752
AND I HAVE TAKEN TIME OUT OF MY BUSY GODLY SCHEDULE TO SCRUTINIZE YOUR POINTLESS EXISTENCE.
4752
OUT OF THE COUNTLESS TRILLIONS OF LIFE FORMS I BROUGHT INTO REALITY THROUGH ANGRY GRUBFUCK POWER ALONE, I HAVE SELECTED YOU FOR EXAMINATION AND HARASSMENT.
4752
PERSONALLY I THINK THAT WARRANTS A LITTLE GRATITUDE, AND JUST MAYBE, A BIT OF DEFERENCE.
4752
A CURTSY, PERHAPS?
4752
BUT YEAH GO AHEAD AND KEEP BLOWING ME OFF LIKE THE FLAKEY LITTLE TWERP YOU ARE.
4752
HEY DON'T TALK TO HER LIKE THAT YOU UNCOUTH PIECE OF SHIT.
4752
THIS IS REFLECTING POORLY ON BOTH OF US, IT'S GODDAMNED EMBARRASSING.
4752
OH WOW, ANOTHER MIRACLE.
4752
IT MUST BE PERIGEES EVE, BECAUSE GET A LOAD OF THIS HUGE BEHEMOTH LEAVING THAT JUST GOT DRAGGED IN.
4752
JADE, OUR DUTY IS CLEAR. WE MUST DECK THIS TURD TO THE NINES.
4752
OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS A CLEVER THING TO SAY. WHAT A DIPSHIT.
4752
JADE, I'M SORRY ABOUT PAST ME'S RETARDED BEHAVIOR.
4752
I'M NOT GOING TO DRAG OUT A HUGE APOLOGY OR ANYTHING BECAUSE I ALREADY APOLOGIZED IN AN EARLIER CONVERSATION, OK. I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.
4752
GOD DAMMIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
4752
I MEAN, AM I SERIOUS?????
4752
WILL I BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS SHIT. WILL I REALLY BACK DOWN LIKE A LIMP FRONDED STOOGE? PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.
4752
PLEASE, JUST
4752
SHUT UP
4752
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER THOUGHT FUTURE ME WAS THE STUPID ONE
4752
PAST ME IS THE DUMBEST BUCKET OF FESTERING DISCHARGE I EVER FELL ASS BACKWARDS INTO.
4752
COME ON, YOU KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. REMEMBER ALL THE PAST USSES WE USED TO TALK TO??
4752
THEY WERE EVEN PASTER THAN YOU, AND THEREFORE DUMBER.
4752
YEAH, I REMEMBER ALL THOSE DUMBSHIT PAST USSES, BUT THEY DON'T HOLD A FUCKING JACKASS CANDLE TO FUTURE USSES.
4752
AND YOU'RE THE FUTUREST ME I EVER HAD THE CROTCH BLISTERING MISFORTUNE OF JAWING WITH, SO THE FUCKHEAD TROPHY GOES TO YOU.
4752
I MEAN, MY GOD, WHY.
4752
IS PROXIMITY TO THAT NASTY LOOKING SPACETIME RIP ON THE TIMELINE MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD?
4752
IS THAT WHAT'S CAUSING YOU TO FEEL PITY FOR THIS IMBECILE?
4752
LOOK, JADE'S NOT THAT BAD OK.
4752
YOU JUST GOT TOO WORKED UP, AND YOU CAN'T SEE THAT.
4752
AND NOW ALL THIS FROTHING PANDEMONIUM JUMPING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS JUST RIDICULOUS OVERCOMPENSATION FOR YOUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND MISTAKES, AND MASKING SOME FEELINGS YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN TOUCH WITH.
4752
THIS IS ALL SO OBVIOUS, I'M FLUSHING LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER IN EMBARRASSMENT HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, AND EVEN WORSE, REMEMBERING HAVING IT EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE SMART ONE THREE HOURS AGO AND STILL ACTING LIKE A MOIST GLOBE EVEN AFTER BEING SO SOUNDLY SCHOOLFED.
4752
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A JOKE.
4752
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF, WE DON'T JOKE AROUND. IT'S JUVENILE, REMEMBER.
4752
I'M GOING TO VOMIT.
4752
I'M MAKING A MENTAL NOTE TO SLAP MYSELF THREE HOURS FROM NOW, FOR BEING ENOUGH OF A SAP TO START DEVELOPING RED FEELINGS FOR A DUMB ANNOYING HUMAN, IF I'M READING BETWEEN THE LINES CORRECTLY.
4752
I JUST SLAPPED MYSELF! I REMEMBERED MY LAME NOTE TO MYSELF FROM THREE HOURS AGO, AND THEN SLAPPED MYSELF SPECIFICALLY TO MOCK YOU.
4752
IT STINGS TOO, YOU'LL FEEL IT IN A WHILE. AND THEN THE GHOST OF PAST ME WILL CRY.
4752
PAST ME DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE. HE'S A STUPID BAWLING WIGGLER PHANTOM. HE'S DEAD, NOT A REAL GUY ANYMORE, LIKE ME.
4752
I'M THE REAL ONE. YOU'RE FAKE, A SHADOW OF A SAD MEMORY THAT PISSED ITS PANTS WHILE SCREAMING.
4752
TIME TO DEAL WITH IT.
4752
YES!!!!!
4752
LET THIS FUCKER KNOW THE SCORE JADE. THIS IS HOW WE ROLL.
4752
OH SHIT
4752
YES, THAT WAS GREAT. WE BOTH HAD IT COMING, ESPECIALLY HIM. GREAT WORK JADE.
4752
OH RIGHT, ABOUT THAT
4752
YEAH WE NEED TO TALK
4752
I MEAN WE HAVE ALREADY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
4752
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY BUSY SOON, BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO ENTER YOUR SESSION
4752
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU DO, THEN JUST HIT ME UP, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
4752
LOOK I KNOW THINGS ARE WEIRD BETWEEN US RIGHT NOW AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE MAD.
4752
ESPECIALLY AT THAT LOSER.
4752
BUT THINGS WILL CHANGE, IN TIME YOU'LL SEE I'M NOT QUITE SO AWFUL, OK?
4752
OH I SEE, NOW YOU COULD USE A KNIGHT, HOW VERY INTERESTING, HMMM.
4752
GOD I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO BE FUTURE YOU, SLIGHTLY LESS FUTURE YOU IS SUCH A GOD DAMN PILL
4752
YEAH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
4752
HAHAHAHA, YOU HEAR THAT YOU OBSOLETE PILE OF GARBAGE? JADE JUST FLIPPED YOU OFF WITH A COLORFUL FINGER.
4752
MAN, SHE OBVIOUSLY HATES YOU MORE. SHE CALLED YOU A SYCOPHANT WHICH IS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DESCRIPTIVELY WORSE THAN JUST BEING A RUN OF THE MILL SCUMBAG LIKE ME.
4752
SHE IS TOTALLY ON TO YOU AND HOW DESPICABLE YOU'VE BECOME, CAN YOU BLAME HER FOR HATING US?
4752
NO, I CAN BLAME YOU, YOU'RE THE ONE WITH NO MANNERS WHO'S ALL TWISTED UP INSIDE.
4752
HOW'S THIS FOR A PACT, EVERYBODY.
4752
PAST KARKAT ONLY TALKS TO PAST JADE FROM NOW ON, AND THE TWO OF THEM CAN BICKER LIKE SHITTY LITTLE CHILDREN FOR HOURS/YEARS RESPECTIVELY.
4752
AND FUTURE KARKAT ONLY TALKS TO FUTURE JADE, AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREIN ONLY INTELLIGENT DISCOURSE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN TWO CIVILIZED, MATURE, GROWN ASSED ADULTS.
4752
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK??????
4752
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST BAN HER ALREADY AND END THIS TORMENT SINCE YOU DRAGGED HER INTO THIS.
4752
FUCK THAT YOU BAN HER. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SEEMS TO "CARE".
4752
WILL YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH, MAN THE FUCK UP, AND BAN THIS POOR GIRL ALREADY?
4752
OK, THERE. SHE'S GONE.
4752
MAYBE NOW YOU GET IT.
4752
HOW HIDEOUS EVERYONE THINKS YOU ARE, MAYBE YOU'LL FINALLY STOP FUCKING EVERYTHING UP.
4752
HUH
4752
WHAT
4752
I THINK
4752
I WAS PROBABLY WRONG ABOUT JADE
4752
SHE'S A LITTLE LESS LAME THAN I THOUGHT
4752
SHHHHSHHSHSHSHSH
4752
SHE CAN STILL READ THIS YOU STUPID FUCK
4752
NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO OPEN YOUR VEINS AND WRITE POEMS ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
4752
FUCK YOU, I'M JUST VOICING A HARMLESS OBSERVATION OK
4752
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS IF SOME LUNK HEAD IN THE FUTURE GETS CARRIED AWAY WITH WHATEVER LITTLE THOUGHTS I MAY OR MAY NOT NOW BE THINKING
4752
I...
4752
BUT
4752
HOW COULD THAT EVEN BE A REAL THING I TYPED THREE HOURS AGO, HOW COULD I BE THIS STUPID.
4752
WE ARE JUST THE DUMBEST FUCKERS WHO EVER LIVED AREN'T WE.
4752
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
4752
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ENERGY TO BAN US.
4752
I'M JUST LEAVING.
4752
YEAH
4825
IT'S ME AGAIN, ASSHOLE
4825
THE ONE WHO HATES YOU, REMEMBER?
4825
OR SHOULD I SAY FUTURE-REMEMBER???
4825
AGAIN WITH KNOWING MY NAME
4825
IT'S REALLY FUCKING UNSETTLING WHEN YOU DO THAT.
4825
I WONDER HOW FAR BACK YOU KNOW IT
4825
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A SPECIAL POINT OF NOT BEING THE ONE TO TELL YOU, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE SATISFACTION.
4825
WHO THE FUCK IS JADE.
4825
JOHN, THE FACT THAT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO THINK I CAN READ YOUR MIND JUST UNDERSCORES WHAT A HARROWING GODDAMN IDIOT YOU ARE.
4825
OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE WHO FUCKS EVERYTHING UP.
4825
WHY THE FUCK WOULD I KNOW THAT.
4825
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME I HAVE EVER TALKED TO A HUMAN.
4825
AND THE FIRST TIME, MUCH TO MY MIGRAINE COMPOUNDING REGRET, WAS WITH YOU.
4825
NO, NOT "COOL".
4825
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS VERY MUCH ANTITHETICAL TO YOUR PRIMITIVE HUMAN NOTION OF "EARTH COOL".
4825
YOU SEE, IN OUR FIRST CONVERSATION, WE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.
4825
IT IS A FOOT WHICH SHOULD HAVE REEKED OF YOUR VERBAL RUINATION.
4825
BUT INSTEAD IT SMELLED LIKE
4825
WELL, LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT.
4825
I AM HERE TO DO WHAT YOU AND YOUR PATHETIC CADRE OF CO-HUMANS FAILED TO DO, WHICH IS SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
4825
I AM HERE TO UTTERLY ANNIHILATE YOUR SHIT.
4825
I WILL STAY ON MESSAGE THIS TIME. I WILL NOT BE DETERRED BY YOUR GOOFY MANNERISMS AND YOUR ABSURD PENCHANT FOR REVELING IN SELF ABUSE.
4825
WE WILL GET OFF ON A FRESH FOOT, AND BY FRESH I MEAN MOST FOUL INDEED.
4825
ITS TOES ARE WIGGLING UNDER YOUR HIDEOUS PINK NOSTRILS. NOW BREATHE DEEP YOUR MISFORTUNE, YOU SAD LITTLE CLOWN.
4825
THIS IS THE END OF YOU. THAT AROMA YOU DETECT WAFTS FROM THE BOUQUET PERCHED ON YOUR CORPSE BOX.
4825
NOBODY CRIES, EXCEPT YOUR SHITTY GHOST. HEAVY SOBS FROM A SPECTER OF UNQUALIFIED FAILURE.
4825
IT IS A SYMPHONY TO MY ANGRY EARS.
4825
STFU
4825
I'M ONLY GETTING STARTED.
4825
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN???
4825
YOU ARE ACTUALLY ENJOYING THIS, WHAT A SICK FUCK.
4825
DON'T QUESTION THE SINCERITY OF MY HATE, JUST DON'T EVEN FUCKING GO THERE.
4825
YEAH I SEE HER
4825
IT'S MAKING ME MAD SEEING HER
4825
HAHAHAHAHAHA
4825
HERE I AM TALKING TO YOU MOMENTS AFTER YOU DID THE TERRIBLE THING, AND YOU STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DID!
4825
INCREDIBLE, YOU TRULY ARE DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT.
4825
WHAT
4825
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.
4825
WHAT YOU FUCKING DID IS WHAT'S GOING ON.
4825
OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU FUCKING DID?
4825
VERY WELL, JOHN HUMAN EGBERT.
4825
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID
4825
READY FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID?
4825
HERE'S ME, TELLING YOU WHAT YOU DID
4825
OK, HERE GOES
4825
WHAT YOU DID IS AS FOLLOWS
4825
AS SUCH
4825
AND THUSLY
4828
YOU MADE AN UNBEATABLE BOSS IS WHAT YOU DID.
4829
THE IDIOT YOU CALL THE JADE HUMAN WENT AHEAD AND PROTOTYPED HER FREAK OF A LUSUS, WHILE YOU DECIDED TO TAKE A NAP FOR SOME REASON RATHER THAN DOING WHAT A LEADER IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND STOP HER FROM BEING SO FUCKING RETARDED.
4830
YOUR VERSION OF JACK, WHO YOU WERE SOMEHOW DUMB ENOUGH TO ENTRUST WITH THE QUEEN'S RING, BECAME ESSENTIALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE.
4830
HE THEN WENT ON A RAMPAGE THROUGH YOUR POINTLESS SESSION, WHICH HILARIOUSLY, WAS ALREADY A LOST CAUSE EVEN BEFORE THIS HAPPENED!
4830
I AM JUST BESIDE MYSELF WITH THE SPECTACULAR BREADTH OF YOUR FAILURE.
4831
AND IF THIS WASN'T BAD ENOUGH
4831
YOUR "SOLUTION" LATER WOULD BE TO OPEN A RIFT IN SOME GLORIOUS GESTURE OF MEANINGLESS SUICIDE.
4832
AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
4832
BUT THE RIFT YOU OPENED ENABLED HIM TO ENTER OUR SESSION, JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO CLAIM OUR PRIZE.
4833
AND NOW WE'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO FUCKING DEAL WITH HIM!
4833
SO THANKS A LOT, SHIT HEAD.
4834
OH
4834
OK, MY BAD, I FORGOT I WAS TALKING TO A MEMBER OF A GENERICALLY BIZARRE ALIEN SPECIES.
4834
I GUESS SOME HUMANS HAVE A LUSUS, WHILE OTHERS DON'T? WHATEVER.
4834
HER LUSUS IS THE CREATURE WHICH SERVES AS HER CUSTODIAN.
4834
I GUESS
4834
JOHN, DO YOU EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?
4834
IS THIS HOW HUMAN FRIENDSHIP WORKS? YOU JUST DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT EACH OTHER?
4834
HER LUSUS EXHIBITS THE PROPERTIES OF A LEGENDARY ENTITY CALLED A FIRST GUARDIAN.
4834
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY.
4835
OK, FOR STARTERS, NOTICE HOW THE FURIOUS WALL OF FIRE CURRENTLY RUSHING TOWARD YOU IS TURNING GREEN?
4835
YEAH
4835
THOSE FUCKING PROPERTIES.
4836
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
4836
AS THE DEFENDERS OF THEIR PLANETS, THEY'RE VIRTUALLY OMNIPOTENT.
4836
PROTOTYPING ONE IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE.
4837
THE RESULT IS A BOSS A HELL OF A LOT WORSE THAN WHAT WE HAD TO FIGHT, AND WE PROTOTYPED TWELVE TIMES RATHER THAN A MEASLY FOUR.
4837
AND ONE OF OUR PROTOTYPINGS INCLUDED AN OUTER FUCKING GOD THE SIZE OF A CITY!
4837
I HOPE THIS PUTS IN PERSPECTIVE HOW TERRIBLE YOU ARE.
4838
ALRIGHT WELL
4838
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU TO MAN UP AND APOLOGIZE FOR IT, SO OK I'LL GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT.
4838
BUT IT'S NOT STOPPING ME FROM DETESTING YOU AND IT SURE AS FUCK ISN'T GOING TO DERAIL THIS RUNAWAY HATE TRAIN, JUST SO YOU KNOW.
4838
HEY, INOPPORTUNE NAPS HAPPEN IN THIS GAME.
4838
EXCEPT TO ME, BEING THE STALWART MODEL OF LEADERSHIP I AM.
4838
I MANAGED TO STAY AWAKE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS STRAIGHT, I DIDN'T WANT TO LET MY GUARD DOWN FOR A SECOND.
4838
BUT THEN
4838
AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER, AND WE RETREATED IN FAILURE
4838
I FOOLISHLY DID.
4838
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW HIM.
4839
JACK.
4839
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED.
4839
BUT ON PROSPIT, I SAW HIM UP CLOSE, WITHOUT ALL THAT RIDICULOUS GREEN SHIT OBSCURING HIM.
4839
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT WAS REALLY HIM BY THE WAY HE LOOKED, BUT I JUST KNEW.
4839
HE WAS WEARING A RING I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE, CERTAINLY NOT ONE BELONGING TO OUR QUEENS.
4839
WE DESTROYED THOSE.
4839
HE WORE IT ON HIS ONE HAND, WHICH WAS COVERED IN OUR MUTANT BLOOD.
4839
AND THEN
4839
JUST LIKE THAT
4839
HE KILLED ME
4839
AND I GUESS
4839
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY JUST HIS WAY OF SAYING HI
4839
I STILL FELT KIND OF BETRAYED.
4839
YES JOHN. BETRAYED.
4840
WHEN I WOKE UP, EVERYONE HERE WAS BUZZING ABOUT THESE ALIENS CALLED HUMANS.
4840
SO NATURALLY I'M LIKE WHO GIVES A SHIT, RIGHT?
4840
WELL, WRONG.
4840
I PRETTY QUICKLY DETERMINED THAT HE WAS FROM YOUR SESSION, NOT OURS.
4840
SO HE WASN'T REALLY "MY JACK"
4840
AND I WAS SORT OF RELIEVED
4840
RELIEVED BUT ALSO ENRAGED
4840
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE FEELING.
4841
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED, AND THAT'S WHY YOU ARE SUCH A DISGRACE.
4841
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TIME I WILL EVER EXPLAIN ALL THIS STUFF TO YOU, BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WILL HELP MY HEADACHE MUCH TO REPEAT MYSELF.
4841
I BET IT'LL BE PRETTY FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IN THE PAST!
4841
HA HA! I'M LAUGHING MY ASS OFF AT YOUR FUNNY FUCKING JOKE.
4841
I HOPE THIS IS THE CALIBER OF HUMOR I CAN EXPECT FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE-PAST, EGBERT.
4841
IT'LL BE A REAL TREAT TROLLING YOU WITH MORE OF THOSE NUB SLAPPERS TO LOOK FORWARD TO!
4841
WOW, WHAT A CRYPTIC STATEMENT.
4841
CHECK THIS OUT, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.
4841
ANYWAY, GUESS I'LL GET GOING AND LET YOU DIE IN YOUR FIRE, WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD, BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO FOR SOME REASON.
4841
I'VE GOT TO REWIND THE TAPE ON THIS CLUSTERFUCK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.
4841
WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT YOUR DUMB HUMAN FRIEND AND HER PETULANT, MEANINGLESS DEMANDS.
4841
WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO WITH ME.
4841
A;SLDKJFSDLKFJS;LDJFLK;J
4841
HERE, JOHN HUMAN DIPSHIT.
4841
HAVE A SECOND AND PENULTIMATE FUCK YOU:
4841
"FUCK"
4841
"YOU"
4841
MAY IT MARK THE SECOND OF MANY TO COME, AND THE MAGNIFICENT DENOUEMENT TO MANY RECEIVED.
4841
TOGETHER WE JUST TUGGED AT THE BOW TO UNRAVEL A PRESENT FULL OF GO FUCK YOURSELF.
4841
HAPPY WRIGGLING DAY YOU UGLY PILE OF TRASH.
5150
ATTENTION HARLEY.
5150
PLEASE STOP WEEPING WITH AND OR BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR SELF PROTOTYPED LUSUSPRITE
5150
STOP DOING ONE OF THOSE THINGS AT LEAST
5150
LONG ENOUGH TO ANSWER ME.
5150
PLEASE.
5150
PRETTY POLITE EARTH PLEASE.
5150
WHO AM I KIDDING
5150
I'M WASTING MY TIME AGAIN
5150
WHOA FUCK
5150
YOU ANSWERED ME, I DONT BELIEVE IT
5150
WHAT
5150
YOU ARE
5150
OH YEAH?
5150
HOW SO, EVERYTHING HERE APPEARS TO BE PROCEEDING RATIONALLY.
5150
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM
5150
MESS? JADE, NOW IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE *YOU'RE* THE ONE WHO'S JOKING.
5150
YOUR HIVE BALL ROLLED DOWN A BEAUTIFUL WINTER HILL, AND YOU ARE SPENDING SOME QUALITY TIME WITH FAMILY.
5150
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FILL ME IN ON THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.
5150
HMM.
5150
YES. "HMM."
5150
HMM AS IN HMM INTERESTING.
5150
AS IN HMM HOW VERY, VERY FUCKING INTERESTING INDEED.
5151
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT AM I GETTING AT.
5151
I'M GETTING AT WHATEVER HMM INTERESTING GETS AT.
5151
PLEASE GO ON, I'M LISTENING TO YOUR PROBLEM.
5151
HMMMMM.
5151
OK, FINE.
5151
WHAT OTHER SEQUENCE OF LETTERS WOULD YOU HAVE ME USE TO REGISTER MY PROFOUND FASCINATION.
5151
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
5151
I AM BEING SENSITIVE ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF A RAGING FUCKASS, ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT.
5151
YES, IT IS, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST ASK FUTURE YOU, ASSUMING THAT CONVERSATION DOESN'T MAKE YOU CRY AS WELL.
5151
NOW TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.
5151
YES, HOW DID THIS MAKE YOU FEEL.
5151
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.
5151
o:B
5151
NO, NO
5151
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT BACKWARDS
5151
THOSE ARE MY HORNS
5151
OK SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU
5151
YOU'RE ANGRY AT A VERSION OF YOURSELF FROM A DIFFERENT POINT IN TIME
5151
BECAUSE SHE'S BEING AN OVERLY EMOTIONAL SHITHEAD WHO IS BASICALLY THE MOST REVOLTING SELF LOATHING PIECE OF FILTH YOU HAVE EVER MET
5151
AM I FOLLOWING
5151
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY HMM AGAIN
5151
BUT COME ON
5151
DON'T YOU FIND THE SITUATION TO BE JUST THE SLIGHTEST BIT INTERESTING?
5151
I MEAN, CONSIDERING
5151
IF I RECALL, IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO FROM EITHER OF OUR PERSPECTIVES THAT YOU WERE RIPPING ON ME AND MY SMUG WINDBAG FUTURE SELF FOR ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER
5151
HOW IS THIS NOT LIKE THAT
5151
OH I SEE, AND ALL THOSE IDIOT PAST AND FUTURE KARKATS WEREN'T???
5151
OH AREN'T YOU
5151
YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE, I JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT
5151
SO TELL ME
5151
HOW IS THIS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST FUCKING BIT DIFFERENT?
5151
YES, GO ON
5151
I'M REALLY CURIOUS
5151
HOW
5152
NOT REALLY
5152
IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE A SANE RATIONAL PERSON, AND THERE JUST MIGHT BE HOPE FOR YOU YET
5152
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
5152
IT MEANS ALL OF YOUR HIDEOUS FLAWS DISGUST YOU.
5152
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE DISGUSTED, IT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN SAY FOR THEMSELVES.
5152
REALLY, CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.
5152
CONGRATULATIONS, IN ADDITION TO, JUST MAYBE, AN APOLOGY.
5152
DON'T YOU THINK?
5152
WOULD IT REALLY KILL YOU TO CONSIDER IT?
5152
DEAD DREAM DOG JADE, IS THAT YOU??? YOU'RE SOUNDING A BIT HYSTERICAL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALM DOWN.
5152
WELL IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO GET YOUR ANEURYSM UNDER CONTROL
5152
MAYBE YOU WILL REALIZE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SPECIFY TO WHOM AN APOLOGY WAS IN ORDER.
5152
IDIOT.
5152
I GUESS
5152
THIS APOLOGY WAS GOING TO GO DOWN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, SO THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE THE TIME.
5152
AND LET'S FACE IT, I WAS REALLY BEING THE WORST KIND OF PHLEGM BUBBLE BLOWN OUT A NOISY GLISTENING ASS.
5152
SO I'M SORRY.
5152
BUT TO BE FAIR, IT WAS MY PAST SELF WHO WAS GIVING YOU SUCH A HARD TIME, AND HE'S COMPLETELY DERANGED.
5152
YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING.
5152
HE, BEING ME, RIGHT NOW, IS OWNING UP TO WHAT A FUCKING RETARD PAST ME WAS, AND CONTINUES TO BE.
5152
YES, I KNOW IT'S LAME.
5152
OR I KNOW THAT YOU THINK IT'S LAME WHEN I SAY SHIT LIKE THAT.
5152
BECAUSE REMEMBER
5152
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU FROM THE FUTURE, AND I KNOW YOU DON'T COTTON TO MY PCG/FCG STUPIDITY.
5152
BUT SEE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YET.
5152
OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YET.
5152
SO I'M KIND OF PULLING A FAST ONE HERE.
5152
YEAH I'M GOING TO.
5152
THE THING IS, I KIND OF MISREPRESENTED MYSELF.
5152
I'M NOT AS MUCH OF A SCUMBAG AS I WAS SO DETERMINED TO MAKE OUT WITH MYSELF TO BE.
5152
FUCK I MEAN
5152
MAKE MYSELF OUT TO BE
5152
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I TROLLED YOU LIKE THAT SO PERSISTENTLY
5152
FOR SOME REASON DEEP DOWN I JUST KNEW THAT I HAD TO
5152
EVEN IF IT MEANT DIGGING MYSELF INTO A HUGE HOLE WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT WOULD BE HARD TO CLIMB OUT OF
5152
AND LIKE PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING I SAID WAS COMPLETELY BASELESS BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW YOU
5152
JUST LIKE YOU DIDN'T AND STILL DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ME
5152
SO I GUESS I AM APOLOGIZING FOR IT, LIKE REALLY SERIOUSLY NOW.
5152
I, PRESENT KARKAT, IN THE CURRENT MOMENT, APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF MY STUPID PAST SELF, *WHO IS ACTUALLY ME*.
5152
THE GUY TALKING RIGHT NOW.
5152
LIKE, THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE GUYS, OK?
5152
HMMMM???????
5152
HM WHAT
5152
OK, GREAT.
5152
NO BUT
5152
YOU WERE RIGHT, I AM CRAZY
5152
BUT THANKS ANYWAY
5152
YEAH
5152
MAKING PLANS AND WHATNOT
5152
TO PRY OURSELVES MUTUALLY OUT OF THIS MASSIVE MOBIUS DOUBLE CLUSTERFUCK.
5152
OK WELL THE MOST IMMEDIATE POINT OF BUSINESS IS
5152
YOU SEE THAT GLOWING BLUE SCREEN BEHIND YOU?
5152
YOU NEED TO TURN THAT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT OFF.
5153
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT.
5153
BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO SCREW WITH.
5153
THERE ARE OUTCOMES THAT ARE EVEN WORSE THAN THE COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF EXISTENCE ITSELF
5153
FORCES MORE DAMAGING TO THE INTEGRITY OF REALITY THAN THOSE CAPABLE OF TURNING IMAGINATION INTO PURE VOID
5153
THEY ARE FORCES WHICH IF HANDLED RECKLESSLY WILL NULLIFY THE BASIC ABILITY OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN ALL REAL AND HYPOTHETICAL PLANES OF EXISTENCE TO GIVE A SHIT.
5153
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW
5153
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TURN THE THING OFF
5153
AND THEN DO THE NEXT THING I WAS TOLD TO TELL YOU TO DO.
5153
BY YOU.
5153
YES.
5153
YOU COULD BE TELLING YOURSELF THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE'RE SORT OF WORKING ON A STRICT NO MEMO POLICY.
5153
WHICH IS YOUR IDEA OF COURSE.
5153
DID I MENTION HOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE ARGUE WITH OUR PAST/FUTURE SELVES? YES, PRETTY SURE I DID.
5153
SO I'M GOING ALONG WITH THE POLICY AS BEST I CAN.
5153
I AM BEING PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE, AND I WILL GENTLY LOWER A MAGNIFICENT, CORUSCATING COLUMN OF HOT FUCK YOU DOWN THE PROTEIN CHUTE OF ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE.
5153
YOU DON'T SAY.
5153
SO ANYWAY, BECAUSE OF THAT, MY ROLE AT THE MOMENT IS TO ACT AS A SORT OF GO BETWEEN FOR YOU AND YOUR FUTURE SELF
5153
TO HELP ALONG THE PROCESS OF MAKING THESE PLANS
5153
WHILE YOUR FUTURE SELF IS DELIBERATELY VAGUE ABOUT SOME STUFF SO AS NOT TO "JINX" THE CONCEPTION OF THE IDEAS IN THE FIRST PLACE I GUESS?
5153
ALL WHILE YOUR CURRENT SELF IS NECESSARILY KIND OF DUMB ABOUT EVERYTHING.
5153
SORRY, OK, JUST KIND OF IGNORANT
5153
BECAUSE STUFF HASN'T HAPPENED YET
5153
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
5153
IT'S NOT ALL THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR ME EITHER, BUT I'M USED TO THIS SORT OF IDIOCY BY NOW.
5153
IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THE MORONIC REVERSE CONVERSATION WITH EGBERT I TRAPPED MYSELF INTO.
5153
MEANWHILE TIME IS KIND OF RUNNING OUT HERE, WHERE I AM
5153
WE'RE COUNTING DOWN TO SOMETHING
5153
SOMETHING LOOMING ON THE TROLLIAN TIMELINE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS
5153
AND MY TEAM IS KIND OF FALLING APART
5153
I'M COMPLETELY LOSING TRACK OF EVERYONE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
5153
SO AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING ALONG WITH WHATEVER THERE IS TO GO ALONG WITH.
5153
AND THAT IS YOU AND YOUR CRAZY FUTURE PLANS.
5153
AND THE SCRATCH.
5153
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!
5153
AT ONE POINT I THOUGHT I DID, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST WHATEVER SENT JACK HERE.
5153
BUT CLEARLY IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
5153
ARADIA KNEW BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY, AND THEN SHE WENT AND GODDAMN EXPLODED.
5153
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME EITHER, BECAUSE I'M NOT "SUPPOSED TO KNOW" YET.
5153
WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN CARE, LET'S JUST DO IT.
5153
OK, DON'T ASK ME WHY, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.
5153
BUT THAT BLUE SCREEN THERE
5153
FIRST, LIKE I SAID, SHUT IT OFF
5153
THEN YOU NEED TO DRAW IT.
5153
YES
5153
THEN NOTHING
5153
THAT'S IT.
5258
GAMZEE!!!
5258
FUCK
5258
THERE YOU ARE, YOU HAD ME WORRIED DUDE
5258
UH
5258
YEAH
5258
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ANYWAY, I TOLD EVERYONE TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA WANDER OFF.
5258
YEAH, I GET IT WISE GUY, YOU'RE A FUCKING CLOWN, WHO CARES.
5258
QUIT THE BULLSHIT PARTYCLOWN ANTICS AND GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE.
5258
THE SHIT HAS HIT THE WHIRLING DEVICE, AND YOU COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER OUT THERE.
5258
WHAT...
5258
DUDE
5258
ARE YOU OK
5258
YOU'RE REALLY WEIRDING ME OUT.
5258
OH GOD
5258
NO NO NO, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU WENT CRAZY, I COULDN'T TAKE THAT ON TOP OF ALL THIS.
5258
ERIDAN JUST FLIPPED HIS SHIT AND KILLED FEFERI AND KANAYA, AND I'M FREAKING THE FUCK OUT ABOUT IT.
5258
HEH HEH???
5258
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?
5258
SERIOUSLY, GET BACK HERE NOW, AND HAVE A SLIME PIE TO RELAX OR SOMETHING.
5258
UH...
5258
NO? I MEAN, I WOULD NEVER EAT IT, BUT
5258
OH MY GOD
5258
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
5258
GAMZEE
5258
PLEASE NO
5258
OH GOD
5258
OH MAN
5258
OH GOD
5260
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST MEMO I WILL WRITE.
5260
BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.
5260
AND SECOND OF ALL, I MIGHT BE DEAD SOON.
5260
I'M JUST HOPING SOME OF YOU IDIOTS READ THIS, AND EVEN IF YOU THINK I'M FULL OF SHIT NOW, WHEN IT ALL STARTS GOING DOWN YOU MIGHT JUST REMEMBER WHAT I SAID AND SAVE YOURSELVES.
5260
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO HAS HAPPENED.
5260
THE BARD OF RAGE IS ON THE LOOSE.
5260
YEAH, I KNOW WE ALL THOUGHT THAT TITLE WAS A JOKE, BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T.
5260
HE'S COMPLETELY SNAPPED, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU FURTHER AHEAD ON THE TIMELINE, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW DANGEROUS HE IS.
5260
REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO THE BLACK KING.
5260
NOBODY COULD EXPLAIN IT, AND THEN HE JUST WENT BACK TO SPACING OUT FOR THE REST OF THE BATTLE.
5260
I MEAN SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT.
5260
I DON'T EVEN THINK THE KING COULD FUCKING BELIEVE IT, FRANKLY.
5260
DID ANYONE'S ATTACK DO AS MUCH DAMAGE? I DON'T THINK SO.
5260
I DON'T EVEN THINK VRISKA'S DID, ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO SAY SINCE THAT WAS THE KNOCKOUT BLOW.
5260
^^^ SPOILERS.
5260
I GUESS WE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A SECRET JOKE POWER OR SOMETHING?
5260
BUT THE JOKE IS ON US.
5260
HE IS OUT OF PIE, AND NOW THE FAYGO GENIE IS OUT OF THE SHITTY SODA BOTTLE FOR GOOD.
5260
WE ARE SO SCREWED.
5260
OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK.
5260
GUYS, I AM TERRIFIED, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
5260
I'M IN A ROOM FULL OF BODIES, AND I THINK I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TURN MY BACK ON THEM?
5260
OH MY GOD, I JUST HEARD A HONK.
5260
OH GOD OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD
5260
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
5260
IT CAME FROM THE HORN PILE
5260
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS JUST THE BODY SETTLING ON AN ERRANT HORN OR...
5260
OR IF...
5260
I HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
5260
PAST GAMZEE, GOD DAMN IT.
5260
I AM TRYING TO WARN PEOPLE OF YOUR MURDEROUS FUTURE SELF.
5260
THIS PRACTICALLY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
5260
NOW GO BACK TO GROPING YOUR HORNS AND BEING DISTRACTED BY COLORS YOU USELESS FUCK.
5260
LIKE I WAS SAYING.
5260
STILL FREAKING OUT.
5260
AUGH
5260
THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE HONK
5260
IT WAS SO FAINT
5260
DID I JUST IMAGINE IT? I THINK I MIGHT BE LOSING IT.
5260
I REALLY HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE, BUT
5260
I SHOULD TRY TO REVIVE THEM FIRST.
5260
I KNOW DERSE AND PROSPIT ARE GONE, BUT IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE AT ALL THEY SURVIVED I'VE GOT TO TRY.
5260
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING NEAR THAT HORN PILE THOUGH.
5260
WHAT IF HE'S BEEN IN THERE THE WHOLE TIME???
5260
I AM SHITTING MYSELF SO HARD HERE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO.
5260
GUESS I HAVE TO BRAVE IT FOR FEFERI'S SAKE.
5260
OH GOD, FEFERI...
5260
YES I AM DEAD "GLUBBING" SERIOUS, OK.
5260
FEFERI, I'M SORRY.
5260
IT WAS MY FAULT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
5260
FOR
5260
I
5260
I CAN'T DO THIS
5260
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME, I'M SORRY.
5260
BEFORE I GO
5260
EVERYONE SHOULD ALSO KNOW ERIDAN HAD A COMPLETE SHITHIVE MELTDOWN TOO
5260
HE'S GOING AROUND KILLING PEOPLE WITH HIS MAGIC WAND
5260
SO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM.
5260
IF I RUN INTO HIM AGAIN, I'M...
5260
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
5260
HE BETTER PRAY TO ALL HIS MURDERED ANGELS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
5261
HEY ASSHOLE
5261
CONSIDER OUR "PACT" OVER
5261
NOT ANYMORE
5261
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME
5261
PAST YOU, PRESENT YOU, FUTURE YOU
5261
AND ABOVE ALL, UGLY SCARFNECKED DOUCHEBAG HIPSTER YOU
5261
WAIT I FORGOT, ALL OF THE YOUS ARE THAT YOU
5261
IF I WASN'T SO TERRIFIED, I'D BE CONSUMED WITH ANGER, AND AS SOON AS I'M DONE COWERING IN A DARK CORNER HIDING FROM THAT HONKING MURDEROUS TOOL, I'M GOING TO HUNT YOU DOWN AND FILLET YOU WITH MY SICKLE.
5261
OH GOD
5261
I AM NOT HITTING ON YOU IDIOT, THIS IS HONEST TO GOD PLATONIC ENMITY
5261
LIKE IN THE "I REALLY DO WANT YOU TO DIE" KIND OF WAY.
5261
I AM NOT INITIATING AN ELABORATE CALIGINOUS WALTZ WITH YOU YOU DESPERATE SHIT.
5261
UGH, NO
5261
DUDE, ARE YOU AN IDIOT, YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE I AM FROM 300 FUCKING HOURS IN THE FUTURE, EVEN IF I WERE REMOTELY INTERESTED, WHICH TO THAT I SIMPLY SAY WHAT THE FUCK.
5261
LIKE WHAT? WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING HERE
5261
I KNOW YOU'RE LONELY, GOD DAMN IT, WHO CARES.
5261
WAIT, WERE YOU HITTING ON ME BACK THEN?
5261
*ARE* YOU HITTING ON ME?
5261
LIKE AN ACTUAL RED SOLICITATION, IS THAT WAS THIS WAS???
5261
GOD DAMN IT, I AM CHEWING YOU OUT FOR WAND MURDER, AND YOU ARE FLIRTING WITH ME
5261
MY FUCKING GOD MAN.
5261
HOW ABOUT NO, DIPSHIT, NOT INTERESTED?????
5261
WHY NOT
5261
IS THIS REAL, ARE YOU BEING IRONIC OR SOMETHING, I CAN'T EVEN TELL ANYMORE
5261
THE PROBLEM IS, I CAN'T PUT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR PAST YOU AT ALL, SO I DON'T KNOW.
5261
LIKE FUCK YOU AREN'T
5261
YOU'RE KILLING ANGELS NOW, AREN'T YOU
5261
YOU ARE KILLING FUCKING ANGELS, RIGHT NOW, IN THE PAST, WITH YOUR SHITTY GUN. I JUST KNOW IT.
5261
THIS IS WHY IT WOULD NEVER WORK BETWEEN US, MAN.
5261
BECAUSE YOU ARE A STONE COLD RETARDED FUCKING IDIOT.
5261
NOT TO MENTION COWARDLY BACKSTABBING MURDERER.
5261
I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU FOREVER.
5261
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO THEM
5261
TO
5261
FUCK
5261
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED HER.
5261
AND ALSO...
5261
I CAN'T
5261
I CAN'T EVEN TYPE HER NAME
5261
SHE WAS MY FRIEND
5261
SHE WAS MY REALLY *GOOD* FRIEND AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO NOW THAT SHE'S GONE.
5261
I'M SO UPSET, I'M JUST COMPLETELY FREAKING OUT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.
5261
FUCK NO.
5261
I CAN'T STAND TO LOOK AT YOUR DUMB PURPLE WORDS ANYMORE.
5261
NEXT TIME I SEE THAT SHITTY COLOR YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT'LL BE COMING OUT OF YOUR BODY.
5261
AND NO, FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK, THAT WAS NOT INNUENDO.
5261
ANYWAY
5261
THAT'S IT I GUESS.
5261
OH GOD
5261
OH GOD OH GOD
5261
DON'T YOU SEE EVERYONE?
5261
THIS CRAZY FUCKER HAS COMPLETELY CRACKED, I TOLD YOU.
5261
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD
5261
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
5261
.....
5261
NO I DON'T WANT TO
5261
OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK
5261
I HAVE TO GO
5320
JOHN.
5320
I'M NOT SURE WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS.
5320
I GUESS IT'S JUST OUT OF A SENSE OF OBLIGATION AT THIS POINT.
5320
WE'VE COME THIS FAR
5320
SO I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD KNOW.
5320
I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS ALIVE
5320
THIS MIGHT EVEN BE THE LAST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME.
5320
WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK AM I SAYING, THE LAST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME WILL BE THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME.
5320
I MEAN THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.
5320
BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I COULD BE DEAD SOON.
5320
OH GOD THE HONKING
5320
WHY WON'T THE HONKING STOP
5320
I HAVE TO GO
5320
SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A DOUCHE TO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.
5320
I HOPE YOU CAN SUCCEED AS A LEADER WHERE I FAILED MISERABLY.
5322
WHAT IN THE NAME OF SWEET GLOBE TICKLING FUCK.
5322
EGBERT, I JUST GOT DONE ERUPTING A WHOLE VOLCANO OF MERCILESS FUCK YOU ON THE PRIMITIVE VILLAGE LOCATED SQUARELY ON YOUR CROTCH.
5322
ASSUMING THAT'S A SUITABLY TERRIBLE PART OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR A VILLAGE IN JEOPARDY TO EXIST.
5322
SHUT UP. HOW DARE YOU CONTACT ME WHILE I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKWARDS MARCH OF HATE THROUGH YOUR TEDIOUS TIMELINE.
5322
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN IS THIS
5322
OK, LET ME JUST CHECK THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK WHICH KEEPS CONSISTENT TIME FOR ALL FRAMES OF REFERENCE AND ALL PLANES OF REALITY.
5322
IT'S HALF PAST YOU'RE A MORON.
5322
WE JUST GOT DONE WITH OUR SECOND CONVERSATION. HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THIS?
5322
WHY
5322
OF COURSE WE'RE RUNNING FROM JACK, I JUST GOT DONE FUCKING TELLING YOU THAT.
5322
I GUESS MY FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WILL INSTIGATE SOME MISGUIDED NEED FOR YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME LATER ON.
5322
WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO HERE.
5322
I SWEAR, IT NEVER ENDS WITH THE ULTIMATE RIDDLE SHIT. EVEN AFTER THE GAME IS OVER.
5322
EVEN AFTER YOU LOSE IT! HOW UNFAIR IS THAT.
5322
I CAN TELL THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE A UTTER FUCKING JOY TO PARTICIPATE IN.
5322
I HONESTLY ENVY ANYONE IN THE POSITION OF NOT HAVING TO PUT UP WITH READING IT.
5322
BUT YOU ASKED FOR IT, JOHN, SO HERE WE GO.
5322
ARE YOU READY
5322
NO YOU DON'T
5322
TAKE IT FROM ME
5322
THE GUY IS A BASTARD.
5327
TEREZI? ARE YOU THERE???
5327
OH FUCK, TAVROS IS DEAD TOO?
5327
TEREZI LISTEN TO ME YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THERE.
5327
VRISKA IS THE LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS.
5327
WAIT
5327
FORENSIC ANALYSIS? ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?
5327
PUT YOUR FUCKING GLASSES BACK ON. GOD DAMN IT.
5327
AAAAUUUUUUGH OHFUCK OHFUCK OHFUCK OHFUCK OHFUCK OHFUCK OHFUCK
5331
EQUIUS, ARE YOU THERE?
5331
OK, GOOD
5331
ARE YOU STILL REALLY STRONG?
5331
LIKE, IS THAT STILL YOUR THING?
5331
OK GOOD.
5331
I GUESS THAT WAS A PRETTY DUMB QUESTION.
5331
I NEED YOUR HELP.
5331
GAMZEE IS ON A RAMPAGE
5331
HE'S GOING TO KILL US ALL IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.
5331
WHAT?
5331
YEAH, I GUESS
5331
WHAT
5331
NO I'M SAYING HE FUCKING SNAPPED AND WANTS TO MURDER US ALL
5331
DAMMIT, WHY DOES THIS CONVERSATION HAVE TO BE SO PREDICTABLY TERRIBLE
5331
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
5331
NO, ORDERING YOU TO DO
5331
IS GO FIND GAMZEE AND BEAT HIM TO DEATH WITH YOUR BARE HANDS, OR POSSIBLY TWO HALVES OF A BROKEN BOW, BEFORE HE KILLS ANYONE ELSE.
5331
OH MY GOD
5331
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT IN ALL THE MOST FUCKED UP WAYS POSSIBLE?
5331
YOU'RE GETTING OFF ON THIS AREN'T YOU
5331
IF YOU ASK ME FOR A TOWEL I AM GOING TO FLIP MY SHIT RIGHT OFF THIS FUCKING METEOR
5331
IT WILL JUST BE ME, SPINNING AND SPINNING AND SPINNING INTO ENDLESS NOTHING, SCREAMING
5331
I FORBID YOU FROM GETTING OFF ON ANY OF THIS
5331
DON'T GET OFF ON MY ORDERS, DON'T GET OFF ON PHRASES LIKE FUCK FUCK FUCKETY FUCK, AND DON'T GET OFF ON ANY SORT OF WEIRD ADMIRATION YOU MIGHT BE HARBORING FOR A MURDEROUS CLOWN WITH PURPLE BLOOD
5331
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
5331
I DON'T THINK HE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT YOUR ETIQUETTE LESSONS, OR HOW A TRUE GENTLEMAN IS TO GO ABOUT HANDLING A PROPER FUCKING HORSE TEAT
5331
SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER HERE.
5331
OK, AND?
5331
BUT YOU WON'T FIGHT HIM, IS THAT IT
5331
HOW FUCKING REASSURING!
5331
YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT, I DON'T GET IT
5331
YOU KISS THE GROUND THIS LUNATIC WALKS ON BECAUSE HE HAS PURPLE BLOOD
5331
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM RIPPING ON ERIDAN, I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU DON'T LIKE HIM
5331
AND HIS BLOOD IS EVEN PURPLIER, ISN'T IT?
5331
OK FINE, THEN SPEAKING OF WHICH
5331
HE'S ON A MURDEROUS RAMPAGE TOO
5331
I DON'T KNOW, AT LEAST THREE PROBABLY, BUT WHO EVEN KNOWS AT THIS POINT
5331
THE POINT IS, IF YOU SEE HIM, WOULD YOU MIND SNAPPING HIS STUPID WAND IN HALF OR SOMETHING?
5331
AND THEN CHOKE HIM TO DEATH WITH HIS OWN SHITTY PRETENTIOUS SCARF.
5331
GOD, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM NOW?
5331
WHY
5331
HAHAHAHAHAHA.
5331
I WOULD HIGH FIVE YOU IF IT WOULDN'T SHATTER EVERY BONE IN MY HAND.
5331
AND IF YOU DIDN'T SMELL TERRIBLE.
5331
BUT SERIOUSLY, IF YOU COULD CARRY OUT MY ORDERS IN THE LEAST PERVERSE WAY POSSIBLE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
5331
JUST KILL ONE OR MORE OF THOSE ASSHOLES AND GET BACK TO ME, OK?
5331
I NEED YOU TO COME THROUGH FOR ME, BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF MANPOWER HERE.
5331
YES DIDN'T I MENTION? FEFERI, KANAYA AND TAVROS ARE DEAD, SOLLUX IS UNCONSCIOUS, AND TEREZI IS MISSING.
5331
OH GOD, I HOPE SHE'S OK, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO LOOK FOR HER
5331
I'LL LET IT SLIDE.
5331
JUST DO WHAT I SAY, OK.
5765
HEY.
5765
SHE
5765
SHIT
5765
I FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE FOR READING THIS WHOLE THING.
5765
YEAH
5765
BECAUSE
5765
WOW OK
5765
SO LET ME ASK.
5765
DID YOU BOTH ACTUALLY LIKE EACH OTHER.
5765
LIKE I MEAN SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING ACTUAL GENUINE MUTUAL SENTIMENT OR WHATEVER, NOT SOME LOPSIDED PINING BULLSHIT.
5765
DID YOU LIKE HER, YOU WINDSOCK HEADED SHITMOUTH.
5765
IS WHAT I'M ASKING
5765
OK
5765
THAT'S FINE
5765
THEN
5765
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.
5765
I NEED YOU TO BE ABLE TO THINK STRAIGHT.
5765
WE HAVE IMPORTANT SHIT TO GO OVER, AND I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
5766
PLANS.
5766
NEVER MIND THAT. FIRST, GET OUT OF THE FUCKING BLACKOUT TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN SEE YOU.
5766
LEAVE NOW, I'LL CONTACT YOU IN A WHILE, ONCE YOU'VE LANDED.
5766
LOHAC. OBVIOUSLY.
5766
WELL HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO CAUSE THE SCRATCH, IDIOT.
5766
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON?
5766
WAIT, OF COURSE YOU DON'T, YOU ARE WEARING PAJAMAS AND GIGGLING AT CLOUDS LIKE EACH ONE WAS SHAPED LIKE THE RUDEST BIT OF NAKED ANATOMY A HUMAN CAN RECOGNIZE.
5766
GREAT, AWESOME, NOW GET GOING.
5766
OK, I'M DONE HERE. TALK TO YOU IN ONE SECOND FOR ME, ONE LONG WINDY FUCKING JOURNEY FOR YOU.
5766
OK
5767
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.
5767
NO.
5767
OH, I BET IT IS JUST THE BIGGEST FUCKING BLAST A GUY CAN HAVE WITHOUT A PAIR OF SHAME GLOBES SECURED IN HIS TWO TREMBLING FISTS.
5767
EVERY DOUCHE GOT TO FLY BUT ME, EVEN THE CRIPPLE.
5767
MAY HE REST IN PEACE, I FUCKING GUESS.
5767
OH GOD, YOU ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT?
5767
YOU KNOW WHAT, I GIVE THE FUCK UP TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND HER.
5767
EGBERT, GOD DAMNIT. WILL YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND LISTEN?
5767
WHAT
5767
YEAH, SOMETHING IS WRONG
5767
OR, WAS.
5767
A BUNCH OF US DIED, THE END.
5767
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
5767
YES, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE, OH, THE CLOCK IS RAPIDLY TICKING DOWN TO SOMETHING WE'RE CALLING THE CRITICAL MOMENT, AND NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, SO CLOSE YOUR REEKING QUESTION GEYSER BEFORE IT ASKS.
5767
OH GOD.
5767
JOHN, I CAN'T HANDLE TALKING ABOUT IT, OK.
5767
I JUST GOT DONE
5767
UH
5767
DEALING WITH GAMZEE
5767
AND I'M FEELING PRETTY EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT. SO PLEASE, NO.
5767
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.
5767
MY THINK PAN, IT HURTS
5767
IT IS PRESENTLY THREATENING TO MAKE ME ITS BITCH, JOHN. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
5767
DO YOU WANT YOUR COOL ALIEN PAL TO BECOME THE BITCH OF A RAW, THROBBING THINK PAN?????
5767
SUCH IS THE SCENARIO BEFORE US.
5767
GAMZEE WAS MY VERY GOOD FRIEND, WHO WAS THIS GOOFY LOVEABLE BULLSHIT CLOWN UNTIL HE WENT PSYCHO AND KILLED SOME PEOPLE. I LIKED HIM A LOT.
5767
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS MY BEST FRIEND IS REALLY JUST THE GUY WHO I HAPPEN TO BE FEELING MOST SENTIMENTAL TO AT THE MOMENT, IS THAT A FUCKING CRIME.
5767
SO THEN I
5767
JOHN, TRUST ME. YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
5767
IT'S JUST A TROLL THING, HUMANS WOULDN'T GET IT.
5767
YOU MIGHT THINK I WAS A SHIT HEAD, AND I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT NOW ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, SO LET'S DROP IT.
5768
SHE'S FINE.
5768
SHE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE.
5768
THAT'S THE RULE, JOHN. YOU KISS A DEAD PLAYER IN TIME, AND THEIR DREAM SELF TAKES OVER, ASSUMING THEY STILL HAVE ONE.
5768
IT'S INCREDIBLE YOU REACHED GOD TIER STATUS WITHOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE MORE MUNDANE MEANS OF RESURRECTION AVAILABLE.
5768
WAIT, YOUR UNFAILING CLUELESSNESS MAKES IT THE OPPOSITE OF INCREDIBLE, MY MISTAKE.
5768
NO, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO PICTURE HAPPENING BEHIND THE BLACK CURTAIN, JOHN.
5768
YOU SNOGGING UP YOUR DEAD HATTED MAN LUSUS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MENTAL IMAGE.
5768
OR ROSE'S ADULT WOMAN LUSUS. MAYBE A DEAD WOMAN SWEEPS YOUR SENIOR IS MORE YOUR CUP OF SAUCE, SINCE APPARENTLY YOU ARE "NOT A HOMOSEXUAL", WHATEVER THAT EVEN MEANS, NOT EVEN TO SPEAK OF YOUR RACE'S ABSURD QUALMS WITH THE NOTION OF INCEST, WHICH AGAIN, STILL SORT OF WONDERING HOW THAT CAN EVEN BE A THING.
5768
IS THAT YOUR GAME, EGBERT. HAVE YOU HAD YOUR EYE ON MADAME LALONDE, AND YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CONVENIENT RESURRECTION OPPORTUNITY TO BUST OUT YOUR MOST PASSIONATE SMOOCHMOTIFS KEPT IN RESERVE? AND IN FRONT OF HER DEAD FEMALE "OFFSPRING" NO LESS! JUST SHAMEFUL.
5768
YOU DON'T SAY!
5768
WHAT ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE
5768
EXACTLY, YOU WERE EMBARKING DOWN TRAGEDY LANE, AND WE'VE GOT TO STAMP THAT GARBAGE OUT.
5768
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU GETTING ALL MOROSE WHILE WE'VE GOT SO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE.
5768
FUCK, LOADED PHRASE, FORGET I SAID THAT.
5768
JUST CLAM YOUR SHIT UP AND FORGET YOUR STUPID GUARDIAN, LIKE I DID WITH MY DEAR CRAB MONSTER CUSTODIAN, WHO I ADORED IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER.
5768
YES, THANK YOU.
5768
SHUT THE FUCK UP.
5768
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
5768
ROSE, REMEMBER.
5768
SHE IS WAITING ON DERSE FOR YOUR BOMB TO BE DELIVERED.
5768
IT WILL ARRIVE SAFELY, A LITTLE LATER.
5768
JADE TOLD ME.
5769
JADE FROM FURTHER AHEAD ON YOUR TIMELINE.
5769
BEFORE MY PIECE OF SHIT CLOWN-BRO MADE EVERYTHING TERRIBLE HERE, SHE AND I WERE HAMMERING OUT THESE PLANS.
5769
I TALKED TO HER ACROSS PRETTY MUCH THE FULL SPREAD OF HER TIMELINE, UNTIL THE SCRATCH STARTS AND THE FEED CUTS OUT.
5769
SO I HAVE A SENSE OF THE WHOLE PICTURE HERE, AND IT'S MY JOB NOW TO PUT SOME THINGS INTO MOTION.
5769
YOU SHOULD SIT YOUR ASS TIGHT AND DO THE FUCK WHAT I TELL YOU THE FUCK TO FUCKING DO.
5769
ANYWAY, SHE AND DAVE DO A LOT OF FROG BREEDING, ACCELERATING THE PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY BY EXPLOITING TIME TRAVEL, WITH HELP FROM ME AND KANAYA, SINCE WE WERE IN CHARGE OF FROG DUTIES IN OUR SESSION.
5769
DON'T INTERRUPT, I AM FOLLOWING A TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
5769
OK, KANAYA IS MY OTHER BEST FRIEND, AND SHE WAS THE HERO OF SPACE LIKE JADE WHICH MEANS SHE'S THE STOKER OF THE FORGE AND IS BASICALLY IN CHARGE OF FROGS, WHICH SOUNDS RETARDED, I KNOW. YOU BREED THE RIGHT FROG TO MAKE THE UNIVERSE YOU WANT TO MAKE, WHICH IS A LONG ARDUOUS PROCESS AND I KIND OF FUCKED IT UP IN MY GAME, BUT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STORY WHICH I'LL GET TO LATER, OK?
5769
SHE AND DAVE RAN INTO JACK, WHICH I'M SURE HE MUST HAVE SAW COMING BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE EXPLOIT TIME TRAVEL SO SHAMELESSLY AS HIM, NOT EVEN ARADIA.
5769
JUST ANOTHER DEAD TROLL, WHO CARES.
5769
STOP FROWNING, SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD BEFORE SHE DIED.
5769
SO SHE AND DAVE FOUGHT WITH HIM A WHILE, AND LONG STORY SHORT, HE DIED.
5769
BUT IT'S FINE, I GUESS THAT WAS HIS PLAN, LIKE SOME BIZARRE USELESS LAST STAND, EVEN IF HE DIDN'T TELL JADE WHO WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT UNTIL I TALKED HER THROUGH IT.
5770
YEAH.
5770
RIGHT THERE, WHILE JACK WATCHED LIKE A FUCKING CREEP.
5770
BUT IT WORKED.
5770
WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT SHIPPING, OR MY LUDICROUS STRANGLEHOLD OVER ALL TOPICS CONCERNING ROMANCE, I'M STILL TALKING.
5770
HE WOKE UP ALIVE ON DERSE, AND MET WITH ROSE.
5770
THAT WAS THE END OF THE LINE FOR ALPHA DAVE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, HE DOESN'T TIME TRAVEL AFTER THAT, AND HE AND ROSE STAY ON DERSE WAITING FOR THE BOMB UNTIL YOU START THE SCRATCH. BUT I CAN'T SEE EITHER OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE BLACKOUT LINGERING AROUND ROSE FOR WHATEVER REASON. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.
5770
REGARDLESS, HIS JOB IS TO PLOT A COURSE THROUGH THE RING TO FIND THE SUN.
5770
WHEN HE DOES, EITHER HE OR ROSE WILL DELIVER THE BOMB.
5770
I DON'T KNOW WHICH.
5771
THAT WOULD BE THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THOSE FACTS, YES.
5771
OK, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT GOING ON A SUICIDE MISSION TO SAVE ALL OF REALITY WOULD COUNT AS A HEROIC DEATH?
5771
YOU ASSHOLE, OF COURSE YOU'D BE BRAVE. THAT TENDS TO BE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING REALLY FUCKING COURAGEOUS.
5771
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS. I'VE LOST FRIENDS FOR WAY MORE POINTLESS REASONS. YOU'RE ALL OUT OF OPTIONS HERE.
5771
YOU'D BE RISKING DEATH JUST AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD, AND THEY'RE BETTER QUALIFIED TO HANDLE THE MISSION AS THE DERSE DREAMERS.
5771
JADE'S DREAM SELF IS DEAD TOO, SO SHE'S OUT. OR TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, HER DREAM SELF IS AN OVERLY EMOTIONAL DOG WHO WENT OFF WHIMPERING SOMEWHERE. I'M PRETTY SURE SHE WILL BE COMPLETELY USELESS.
5771
SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. KIND OF A SORE SUBJECT.
5771
SHE THINKS SHE'S SELFISH AND COMPLETELY HYSTERICAL AND I GUESS HATES THE PART OF HERSELF SHE REPRESENTS.
5771
BUT I MEAN, THE THING IS SHE SPENT A LONG TIME BEING DEAD AND MOVING ON, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST BRING SOMEBODY BACK AND EXPECT THEM TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL THE STUFF YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT.
5771
I'VE TRIED TO TELL HER THAT HER SPRITE SELF IS PROBABLY NOWHERE NEAR AS DESPICABLE AS SHE'S MAKING OUT WITH HERSELF TO BE.
5771
I MEAN
5771
MAKING HERSELF OUT TO BE.
5771
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
5771
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
5771
WE'VE ALL GOT FLAWS, EVEN HER
5771
AND FOR ALL THE SHIT SHE'S GIVEN ME ON THIS VERY SUBJECT, SHE KEEPS HERSELF DANGLING FROM A VERY HIGH HOOK.
5771
SHE'D BE DOING ME A MAJOR PERSONAL SOLID BY MAKING AT LEAST SOME ATTEMPT TO GET HERSELF OFF.
5771
WAIT
5771
FUCK
5771
WHAT DID I JUST SAY
5771
I MEANT LET HERSELF OFF.
5771
THE HOOK. THE FUCKING HOOK, IT'S A FIGURE OF GODDAMN SPEECH.
5771
PUT THOSE THE BACK DOWN, BEFORE MY HOT ACID RAGEBREATH BURNS THEM OFF YOUR IDIOTIC FACE.
5771
WHAT WERE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT, IT WASN'T THIS, WHATEVER THIS IS.
5771
IT'S NOTHING, YOU SHIT. IT HAS BEEN THE CONVERSATIONAL EQUIVALENT OF US WHISTLING THROUGH OUR SNORT BARRELS WHILE TOUCHING EACH OTHER INAPPROPRIATELY.
5771
NO, THAT WAS ME BEING WORKED UP INTO THIS RIDICULOUS FUCKING CONNIPTION AND SAYING SOMETHING INFLAMMATORY, GOD. HOW DOES THAT NOT BE CLEAR BY NOW???
5771
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT! THE PAJAMA PRODIGY USED HIS PUZZLE SPONGE TODAY.
5771
BESIDES, JADE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PLAN.
5771
FOR ONE THING, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER TO SEND YOU THE CODE FOR THE QUILLS.
5771
YOU CAN'T SCRATCH THE MESA WITHOUT THEM.
5771
SHE GOT THEM FROM HER DENIZEN, OR WILL LATER ON HER TIMELINE, NOW THAT SHE LIT THE FORGE AND WOKE THE MONSTER UP.
5771
YEAH
5771
HELL IF I KNOW, HER EXPLANATION OF THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER BOILED DOWN TO AND I QUOTE "shenanigans"
5771
LIMED FOR INFURIATINGLY VAGUE.
5771
ANYWAY, AFTER SHE GIVES THAT TO YOU, SHE THEN HAS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE REST OF THE PLAN, WHICH IS MAKING SURE YOU ALL SURVIVE AFTER THE SCRATCH, MINUS ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS OF COURSE.
5771
THE PLAN REVOLVES AROUND SOME REALLY BAFFLING HAND WAVEY MUMBO JUMBO WHICH I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT SHE TOLD ME TO TRUST HER ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE INFO COMES FROM A "Reliable informant."
5771
WHITENED FOR SMUG TOOL.
5771
IT INVOLVES SOMETHING TO DO WITH A YELLOW LAWN RING.
5771
WHICH ISN'T THE HUMAN WORD FOR IT, IT'S JUST YOUR WORD IS SO DUMB I FEEL DUMB SAYING IT.
5771
I GUESS YOUR ENTIRE ESCAPE PLAN SOMEHOW PIVOTS CRITICALLY AROUND AN UNWATERED PIECE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY???
5771
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT MEANS. JADE SAYS SHE HAS THIS FIGURED OUT, AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO MUCH BUT TRUST HER.
5771
THE POINT IS, SHE'S ALL BOOKED UP, AND ALL TOO MORTAL. SO SHE WON'T BE DELIVERING THE BOMB, AND NEITHER WILL YOU.
5771
NO NO NO NO NO NO.
5771
SWEET BLEEDING JEGUS, EGBERT, YOU KEEP BRAGGING ABOUT YOUR IMMORTALITY, AND THEN BRAINLESSLY ANNOUNCE PLANS TO GO OFF AND DO SOMETHING HEROIC! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SHORTEST LIFESPAN OF ANY IMMORTAL IN HISTORY.
5771
BESIDES, IT'S A TOTAL NON ISSUE. JACK WOULDN'T HESITATE TO STAB YOU AGAIN, BUT HE WON'T HURT JADE FOR SOME REASON.
5771
IF ANYTHING, YOU COULD USE HER PROTECTION.
5771
I NEVER NOTICED WHEN LOOKING THROUGH HER TIMELINE EARLIER. IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS TALKING TO HER IN THOSE TIMEFRAMES AND SHE TOLD ME. HE JUST KEEPS FOLLOWING HER AROUND. I CAN SEE HIM OFF IN THE DISTANCE IN SOME FRAMES, JUST LURKING THERE, SHADOWING HER MOVEMENTS. IT'S INCREDIBLY DISTURBING.
5771
HE LINGERS AROUND HER UNTIL THE SCRATCH BEGINS AND I LOSE THE FEED, NEVER ONCE DOING ANYTHING THREATENING. SHE SAYS SHE THINKS IT'S BECAUSE JACK INHERITED LOYALTY OF HER LUSUS.
5771
IF SHE'S RIGHT, I GUESS HER LUSUS REALLY DID OFFER HER THE MOST PROTECTION POSSIBLE BY PROTOTYPING ITSELF, ALBEIT BY DOOMING US ALL. THE IDIOT.
5771
SADLY, HE HOLDS NO SUCH LOYALTY TO ANY OF US HERE. HE REGARDS US ALL AS RIPE FOR THE REPEATED SKEWERING.
5771
OH FUCK, MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE ALL JUST DRESSED LIKE JADE?? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS STROKE OF GENIUS ONLY OCCURRED TO ME NOW.
5771
IT WAS
5771
A MOTHERFUCKING
5771
JOKE
5772
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
5772
IF WE CAN RIDE THIS OUT FOR A LITTLE LONGER UNTIL THE CRITICAL MOMENT, AND DAVE/ROSE CAN DESTROY THE SUN, JACK SHOULDN'T BE A THREAT.
5772
CONVENIENTLY, IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL, THAT WILL SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF OUR OWN ESCAPE PLAN.
5772
APPARENTLY THE EXPLOSION WILL BE SO HUGE, IT WILL BE VISIBLE AT GREAT DISTANCES THROUGHOUT THE FURTHEST RING.
5772
EVEN FROM DIFFERENT SESSIONS, LIKE YOURS AND OURS. YOU WON'T GET TO SEE IT BECAUSE BY THEN YOUR SESSION SHOULD BE WIPED OUT BY THE SCRATCH.
5772
BUT WE WILL. THE PLAN IS TO USE IT AS A BEACON, AND TRAVEL THERE AS A RENDEZVOUS POINT.
5772
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THERE. THAT'S WHAT JADE TELLS ME.
5772
HELL IF I KNOW, THIS IS BASICALLY DREAM INTELLIGENCE, EVERY TIME SHE GOES TO SLEEP, SHE HAS MORE TO RAMBLE ABOUT.
5772
SHE SAYS I SHOULD GO TO SLEEP TO FIND OUT, BUT I'M LIKE HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO BE NAPPING BETWEEN MAKING ALL THESE PLANS AND GETTING PERSECUTED BY THIS DEMENTED HONKING ASSHOLE?
5772
SO YEAH, WE'LL MEET IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EXPLOSION WITH OUR PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE, OR I GUESS I SHOULD SAY OUTSIDE.
5772
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN COME WITH US THOUGH.
5772
DEAD PEOPLE.
5772
AS FOR WHERE, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO STICK AROUND THERE FOREVER. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE DEPRESSING, SINCE WE'RE NOT FUCKING GHOSTS.
5772
THE SCRATCH WILL REBOOT YOUR SESSION. YOUR WHOLE UNIVERSE ACTUALLY. SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS DREADFUL ABYSS, THAT NEW SESSION WILL START UP IN ITS OWN INCIPISPHERE, FROM SCRATCH.
5772
LOOK AT THAT, ANOTHER PUN BECAUSE OF USING THAT FUCKING WORD EVERY OTHER SENTENCE! KILL ME NOW.
5772
BUT THAT "FROM SCRATCH" (F'ING LOL!) SESSION IS WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING FOR TO SURVIVE.
5772
THE IDEA IS FOR YOU ALL TO PRESERVE YOURSELVES BY ESCAPING THERE.
5772
YES.
5772
ONCE YOU'RE THERE, YOU WILL HELP US FIND OUR WAY THERE TOO, AND THEN WE CAN ALL FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK TO DO WITH THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
5772
YEAH, I GUESS, IF ENOUGH OF US ARE ALIVE BY THEN TO MEET.
5772
UH
5772
RIGHT! HAHAHA, JOHN, YOU AND VRISKA BETTER KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELVES, OR EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. NO INTERSPECIES FUNNYBUSINESS, IS THAT CLEAR!
5772
BLAAAAAAARGH, I AM CONVINCINGLY FLIPPING MY LID ABOUT THIS, WAVING MY ARMS AROUND A LOT, AND MAKING ALL MY BEST YELLING FACES. WOW, LOOK AT THAT! IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AGAIN.
5772
POOF! SUBJECT CHANGED.
5772
IF IT WORKS AND YOU WIND UP IN THE NEW SESSION, THAT'S WHY IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS STAYS WITH YOU, SO THEY CAN HELP GUIDE US THERE FROM THE RING.
5772
PROBABLY.
5772
BUT THOSE CHUMPS WON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US, OR ALL OUR PLANS. WHY WOULD THEY?
5772
SO OUT OF EVERYTHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS THE THING THAT HAS YOU TRIPPING GLOBES? WHATEVER YOU SAY!
5772
OK, MAYBE, BUT BEFORE YOU GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE FIRST.
5772
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY, AND STICK TO THE PLAN.
5772
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING READY TO START THE SCRATCH. THE GAME DOESN'T MAKE A HARD RESET THAT EASY TO PULL OFF.
5772
ONCE YOU INITIATE IT, THE GAME THROWS EVERYTHING IT'S GOT AT YOU. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY YOU'RE THE BEST GUY FOR THE JOB, BECAUSE OF YOUR SUPERPOWERS AND SILLY WINDY BULLSHIT.
5772
GET PREPARED, MAKE ALL THE EQUIPMENT YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED, STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.
5772
WAIT FOR JADE TO SEND THAT CODE, WAIT FOR ME TO CONTACT YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND DO YOUR BEST TO HUMOR HIM WHILE HE IGNORANTLY ATTEMPTS TO FLAME YOU BACK INTO THE PUDDLE OF SLIME YOU CRAWLED OUT OF.
5772
PLEASE.
5772
YEAH, BUT CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING IN MY DEFENSE BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?
5772
I DON'T ACTUALLY HATE YOU, AND I NEVER DID. I WAS DELUDING MYSELF.
5772
DEEP DOWN I'M SURE I WAS ALWAYS PRETTY OK WITH YOU.
5772
IT WASN'T A FUCKING COMPLIMENT.
5872
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING NOW.
5872
SERIOUSLY, WHY DID YOU GO BACK TO SEE HER? YOU DIDN'T MENTION THIS LAST TIME.
5872
RIGHT, OK.
5872
LET'S SEE IF I CAN REMEMBER, IT WAS PRETTY ELABORATE IF I RECALL, OK HERE GOES.
5872
I'M A DISGUSTING WORTHLESS BILGESACK ON THE GARGANTUAN TEAT OF A LABORING, LEPROUS MUSCLEBEAST. MY SELF ESTEEM IS SO SMALL, ITS EXISTENCE IS A MATTER OF CONJECTURE AMONG THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS. I SMELL SO BAD, THE STENCH CANNOT BE EXPRESSED WITH EVEN THE MOST ELOQUENT, FLORID LANGUAGE. THE ODOR MY BODY MAKES HAS MADE POETS CRY. I HAVE WON SPECIAL AWARDS FOR DISCOVERING NEW PLACES TO TOUCH MYSELF EROTICALLY WHILE FARTING. I UNFAIRLY PULVERIZE THE COMPETITION IN ASSHOLE PAGEANTS, AND I HAVE RECEIVED A LIFETIME BAN FROM UGLY CONTESTS BY PRESIDENT SHITFACE HIMSELF. MY BLOOD IS NOT FIT TO FLOW THROUGH A SEWER, AND MY SIGN IS A PICTOGRAPHIC SYMBOL THAT LOOSELY TRANSLATES AS "PLEASE HIKE THESE PANTS UP TO THIS GUY'S ARMPITS, CHAIN HIM TO A FLOGGING JUT, AND MAKE A FUCKING EXAMPLE OUT OF THIS SORRY SACK OF SHIT." WHEN I LOOK IN A MIRROR, MY REFLECTION SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD WHILE I WET MYSELF IN SHAME.
5872
WHAT, THAT WAS IT, WASN'T IT. HOW WAS THAT NOT FUCKING IT, DID I FORGET AN APOSTROPHE SOMEWHERE?
5872
CAN WE JUST TALK NOW
5872
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF GRATUITOUS SELF DEPRECATION FORCED INTO MY MOUTH, INVOLVING REFERENCE TO SOME KIND OF WEIRD HUMAN COUPLING RITUAL?
5872
HAHA! WHEE.
5872
CAN WE GET DOWN TO FUCKING BUSINESS AGAIN?
5873
IF YOU WOULD DROP THE PASSWORD SYSTEM AND LET FUTURE ME TALK TO YOU, HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.
5873
SPOILER: THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO, BECAUSE THE PASSWORDS ARE RETARDED.
5873
I STILL THINK YOUR USE OF THE TERMS IS KIND OF ASININE, THERE REALLY IS NO PAST OR FUTURE KARKAT FROM YOUR VIEW
5873
THERE'S KARKAT WHO KNOWS LESS STUFF AND KARKAT WHO KNOWS MORE STUFF. WHY NOT JUST GATHER THE FACTS FROM THE ONE WHO'S GOT THE LOWDOWN ALREADY?
5873
I MEAN, I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T STAND THE GUY.
5873
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING STANDING IN MY WAY. YOUR STUPID PASSWORDS ARE ALSO STANDING IN MY WAY. IF NOT FOR THAT I COULD BE FAST TRACKING THIS TO SOLUTION CITY FOR US BOTH.
5873
OK, WHATEVER, LET'S JUST GET ON WITH THIS "LINEAR CONVERSATION" OK?
5873
SO YOU GAVE ME THAT SILLY PASSWORD, AND WE ENDED OUR CONVERSATION A FEW MINUTES AGO FROM MY END
5873
AND I SCANNED AHEAD LOOKING FOR A GOOD MOMENT ON YOUR TIMELINE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN
5873
AND I NOTICE YOU WENT BACK TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR SOME REASON
5873
SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY
5873
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FROG BREEDING, I THOUGHT WE WERE ON A ROLL WITH THAT
5873
WHAT WAS SHE EVEN SAYING TO YOU, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THAT HORRIFYING GIBBERISH.
5873
I STILL DON'T REALLY GET IT.
5873
WHY MY DENIZEN WAS SUCH A NIGHTMARE WHILE YOURS APPARENTLY GIVES YOU GUTTURAL PEP TALKS IN SOME BYZANTINE MONSTER LANGUAGE.
5873
OOH, VAGUE BULLSHIT, IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING THING I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF.
5873
HUGE UGLY MONSTERS ARE FOR KILLING, PERIOD.
5873
I DON'T REMEMBER, MAYBE?
5873
I'M A BUSY GUY, JADE. I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF, INCLUDING MYSELF.
5873
I THOUGHT SHE KILLED HER DENIZEN TO LIGHT THE FORGE OR SOMETHING
5873
WELL I SURE DON'T THINK IT WAS WHATEVER YOU DID
5873
AND IN ANY CASE I THOUGHT ALL THAT WAS OVER WITH
5873
WHY ARE YOU BACK, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FROG BREEDING?
5873
KANAYA'S STILL HELPING YOU?
5873
OH
5873
I SEE HER ACROSS THE ROOM, SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ANYONE ON A COMPUTER NOW.
5873
WHICH TIME
5873
AH, I SEE HOW IT IS.
5873
YOU WON'T TALK TO FUTURE KARKAT UNTIL I JUMP THROUGH YOUR FUCKING PASSWORD HOOPS AND BECOME HIM EVENTUALLY
5873
BUT YOU'LL TALK TO FUTURE KANAYA JUST LIKE THAT. DOUBLE STANDARD ANYBODY??? JADE SAYS YES PLEASE.
5873
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT SHIT SPOILED FROM THE FUTURE THOUGH.
5873
I THINK I AM ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A RELIGIOUS PERSON, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN TO REMOVE THE AWESOME SUFFERING THAT TROLLIAN'S TEMPORAL CHAT BULLSHIT MIRACULOUSLY CONTINUES TO INFLICT ON ME.
5873
MAYBE THE MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS WILL COME AND TAKE MY PAIN AWAY?? OH YES, THAT SOUNDS HEAVENLY.
5873
JADE, PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO PAINT MY FACE TO OUTWARDLY REFLECT THE BEAUTY OF MY INNER AWAKENING, AND DRUB MY THINK PAN MERCILESSLY TO REDUCE MY INTELLIGENCE TO THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THESE BELIEFS.
5873
ARE WE ALMOST DONE CRAFTING THIS "MASTER PLAN"?
5873
I HAVE STUFF TO ATTEND TO HERE. MY TEAM IS FALLING APART.
5873
AND I CAN'T FIND GAMZEE ANYWHERE. I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT HAVE WANDERED OFF SOMEWHERE AND GOT HURT.
5873
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T TELLING ME ABOUT MY FUTURE.
5873
LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG. JUST UPDATE ME ON THE FROGS, AND GIVE ME A NEW PASSWORD, OK?
5873
BUSY WITH WHAT?
5875
OH GOD, HE'S STILL FOLLOWING YOU?
5875
THAT IS SO MESSED UP.
5875
DON'T TRUST HIM JADE, I'M TELLING YOU. HE IS A STAB HAPPY PLANET EXPLODING ASSHOLE.
5875
REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO DAVE? IT WAS LIKE THIS WHOLE EPISODE, YOU HAD A HYSTERICAL EPISODE ABOUT IT, REMEMBER?
5875
JUST DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON HIM, JADE.
5875
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON THE PUPPY.
5876
HE REALLY SEEMS TO HATE FROGS.
5876
MY JACK HAD THIS IRRATIONAL THING AGAINST FROGS TOO.
5876
I MEAN MY NORMAL JACK. NOT PSYCHOPATH OMNIPOJACK.
5876
WAIT, DID HE FOLLOW YOU INTO THE PALACE TOO JUST NOW?
5876
IS THAT WHO YOU WERE YELLING AT?
5876
I DON'T LIKE THIS A FUCKING BIT, IT MAKES ME REALLY NERVOUS.
5876
YOU JUST CHILLING WITH AN UNSPEAKABLY POWERFUL MASS MURDERER WITH THE BRAIN OF A WILD ANIMAL WHO'S ABOUT TO HOP SESSIONS AND TRY TO KILL ALL OF US IN A FEW HOURS.
5876
AND WHAT WERE YOU EVEN DOING THERE AGAIN, YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME.
5876
THE PALACE.
5877
ABOUT WHAT
5877
OH YEAH
5877
YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR WEEKS
5877
AND YOU NEVER FOUND IT
5877
THE RECKONING HAD STARTED.
5877
WE HAD TO KILL THE KING.
5877
YEAH I KNOW, BUT MAYBE I WAS SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF MUDDLING AROUND WITH FROGS AND THEIR CACOPHONOUS GODDAMN RIBBITS AND MIXING THEIR SLIME AND SHIT.
5877
I'M NOT AN ECTO SCIENTIST NO MATTER HOW MANY GRUBS WHO TURNED OUT TO BE US THE GAME MADE ME ACCIDENTALLY MAKE.
5877
I WAS A SHITTY PROGRAMMER. AND ANYWAY I ONLY PROGRAMMED VIRUSES.
5877
SHITTY VIRUSES.
5877
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A SLIME TECHNICIAN OR A FROG FARMER OR A MYSTICAL FUCKING CROAK DECODER. I'M A WARRIOR AND A LEADER AND A COLD BLOODED KILLER.
5878
HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE
5878
I DON'T MIND HELPING BUT I HAVE MAJOR LEADERSHIP DUTIES TO ATTEND TO HERE.
5878
KANAYA, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
5878
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE, ARE YOU GIVING ME SOME ASSURANCE THAT THINGS WILL WORK OUT?
5878
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL ANYBODY IS.
5878
WHAT THE FUCK IS A VAMPIRE
5878
OH MY GOD WHY CAN'T I GET A STRAIGHT FUCKING ANSWER TO A THING, IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION
5878
THANKS, THAT CLEARED EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT THE HELL UP!
5878
OH
5878
YOU MEAN A RAINBOW DRINKER
5878
YEAH, I ALREADY KNOW ABOUT HER TRASHY NOVEL FANTASIES.
5878
ARE WE DONE SHITTING AROUND
5878
YES, HILARIOUS.
5878
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE TO BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE SKEPTICISM IN THIS SITUATION IS FOR IDIOTS RIGHT?
5878
IF I SAID "YEAH RIGHT! IF THERE'S A DRINKER IN THIS HIVE I'LL EAT MY COCOON!" I'D BE LIKE THE DUMB LUSUS IN THE MOVIE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THE KID WHEN HE TELLS IT THERE'S A RAINBOW DRINKER IN THE CLOSET.
5878
SO I GUESS BY REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY I SHOULD NOT BE THAT DUMBASS, YELL "OH FUCK", AND TELL EVERYONE TO GET IN THE SCUTTLEBUGGY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
5878
WELL FAT CHANCE, I'M NOT FALLING FOR IT.
5878
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ANYWAY, DID YOU SEE HER IN ONE OF YOUR AFTERLIFE BUBBLES?
5878
WHY? WHEN??
5878
JUST
5878
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE, SHIT IS GETTING AWAY FROM ME
5878
THE MORE TIME GOES BY WITHOUT WORD FROM GAMZEE THE MORE I WORRY
5878
AND THE MORE I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED
5878
OR WILL HAPPEN
5878
I SHOULD GO.
5878
FINE.
5878
BUT LET'S MOVE IT ALONG.
5878
DID ECHIDNA TELL YOU WHERE TO FIND THIS FROG?
5879
REMEMBER WHAT?
5879
EXCUSE ME.
5879
REMEMBER
5879
FUCKING
5879
WHAT.
5885
OK GREAT, SO IT'S THERE ON THE MONITOR, PROBLEM SOLVED
5885
YOU JUST APPEARIFY ITS GHOST IMPRINT, MIX IT WITH YOUR CURRENT EVOLUTION'S PARADOX SLIME, SMOOTH OUT THE GENETIC WAVEFORM, TADPOLIFY BILIOUS SLICK, AND YOU'RE DONE.
5885
SO YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING THIS FROG WHEN YOU WERE A KID AT ALL?
5885
HOW DID SHE GET YOU TO REMEMBER?
5885
I MEAN, WHAT DID SHE MAKE YOU AGREE TO?
5885
YOU SAID WHAT SHE ASKED WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
5885
HUH?
5903
JADE?
5903
ARE YOU STILL RESPONDING TO THIS MEMO?
5904
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE MUCH ENERGY LEFT TO ARGUE ABOUT PASSWORDS.
5904
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A PASSWORD LAST TIME.
5904
I HAD TO LEAVE ABRUPTLY BECAUSE SOLLUX AND ERIDAN STARTED DUELING AGAIN.
5904
AND THEN FEFERI AND KANAYA...
5904
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.
5904
AND NOW GAMZEE IS HUNTING US ALL DOWN IN MURDER MODE.
5904
HE'S BEEN TAUNTING ME THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S MESSAGING DEVICES.
5904
AND LEAVING ME DISTURBING NOTES.
5904
I'M SURE OTHERS MUST BE DEAD BY NOW.
5904
AND NOW SOLLUX IS BLIND AND I LOST TRACK OF HIM SOMEHOW.
5904
I HEARD A STRAY HONK AND I RAN AND WE GOT SEPARATED AND
5904
I'M STARTING TO THINK
5904
THAT THIS MUST BE A DOOMED TIMELINE
5904
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH ANYONE
5904
THEY MUST BE DROPPING LIKE BEHEMOTH LEAVINGS OUT THERE.
5904
AND THAT MUST BE WHY
5904
FUTURE KANAYA WAS TALKING IN THIS MEMO
5904
BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD...
5904
WHICH MAKES THAT IMPOSSIBLE.
5904
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.
5904
GAMZEE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO GO CRAZY.
5904
I THINK IF HE DOES
5904
IT MEANS WE FUCKED SOMETHING UP.
5904
IT MEANS *I* FUCKED SOMETHING UP.
5904
HE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY, I HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE'S SAFE.
5904
AND I DIDN'T DO THAT.
5904
ONE TIME, ONE OF THE DOOMED ARADIAS TOLD ME SHE CAME FROM A TIME WHERE HE FLIPPED OUT AND KILLED EVERYBODY, BECAUSE OF MY FAILURE.
5904
I DIDN'T TAKE HER SERIOUSLY, BUT I SHOULD HAVE.
5904
SHE WAS CONSTANTLY FIXING MY FUCKUPS.
5904
ROBOTS FROM THE FUTURE ALWAYS COMING BACK TO TELL ME HOW SOME HASTY SHIT I DID WITH FROG BREEDING OR WHATEVER WOULD MAKE IT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.
5904
MY OWN PERSONAL MISTAKES PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE DOOMED ARADIABOTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
5904
WHICH WAS SORT OF A SILVER LINING I GUESS? I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEATEN THE KING WITHOUT HER ARMY.
5904
NOT THAT IT MATTERS ANYMORE.
5904
I'VE OBVIOUSLY BECOME JUST ANOTHER GUY IN A DOOMED TIMELINE WATCHING EVERYONE AROUND HIM DIE.
5904
I WAS JUST SITTING HERE WONDERING WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE WRONG THIS TIME
5904
TO MAKE THE TIMELINE TAKE A WRONG TURN
5904
AND PINPOINTING IT SEEMED OVERWHELMING SINCE I'VE MADE MORE TERRIBLE DECISIONS THAN I CAN EVEN COUNT.
5904
BUT
5904
I THINK LOOKING BACK
5904
I KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW.
5905
IT WAS BEFORE WE GOT TRAPPED ON THIS METEOR
5905
BEFORE JACK SHOWED UP
5905
BEFORE WE BEAT THE KING
5905
AND I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW, JADE.
5905
THAT NO MATTER WHAT I SAID, I THINK THE FINAL FROG MUST BE IMPORTANT.
5905
AND KANAYA, IF YOU'RE READING THIS SOMEWHERE IN THE PAST MAYBE...
5905
I'M SORRY, YOU WERE RIGHT.
5905
I WAS ALWAYS IN SUCH A HURRY TO WIN, I DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY.
5905
BILIOUS SLICK NEEDED THE GENES OF THAT FROG, AND BECAUSE I HALF ASSED THIS SO BAD EVERYONE IS GOING TO DIE.
5906
SEE, I WAS THINKING
5906
ABOUT JACK, AND HOW HE CAN'T STAND FROGS.
5906
AND I THINK I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.
5906
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT THE END OF OUR TIMELINES.
5906
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE CRITICAL MOMENT IS.
5906
AND IT'S COMPLETELY MY FAULT.
5907
ECTOBIOLOGY IS A TOUCHY THING.
5908
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING THE GENETIC CODE FOR AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE.
5909
OUR GENESIS FROG NEEDED THE GENES FROM THAT FINAL FROG.
5910
BUT BECAUSE I WAS IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY TO DO THE JOB RIGHT
5911
HE'S MISSING A CRITICAL SEQUENCE IN HIS DNA.
5912
SO WHEN WE MADE HIM, AND WATCHED HIM GROW IN THE MIDDLE OF SKAIA
5913
AND AFTER ALL THE FIREWORKS AND FANFARE FROM THE VAST CROAK HAD SUBSIDED
5914
I KIND OF FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T LOOK SO GOOD.
5915
LIKE HE WAS SICK.
5916
I THINK I GAVE HIM CANCER.
5917
I GAVE YOUR WHOLE UNIVERSE CANCER, JADE.
5918
SORRY.
5920
ITS DEFECTIVE GENES PROBABLY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUR SESSION TO BE SUCCESSFUL
5920
SORT OF LIKE
5920
ITS REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM WAS DAMAGED.
5920
WHAT SHOULD BE FERTILE GROUND FOR YOUR NEW UNIVERSE TO GROW
5920
WAS REPLACED BY A MASSIVE BOMB RIGGED TO BLOW UP YOUR WHOLE SESSION.
5920
PROBABLY JUST ONE OF MANY SYMPTOMS OF A SICK UNIVERSE.
5920
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING WRONG
5920
YOU WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE DISEASE THAT WAS ALWAYS INHERENT IN YOUR REALITY
5920
THE ONE I GAVE IT.
5921
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE A NORMAL DISEASE.
5921
NOT LIKE A CELLULAR MUTATION THAT'S OUT OF CONTROL
5921
THE CANCER TOOK A SPECIFIC FORM, LIKE A COMPLICATED SERIES OF TERRIBLE EVENTS RATHER THAN FAULTY CELL DIVISION
5921
IT WAS AN EVENTUALITY IN YOUR UNIVERSE THAT WAS INEVITABLE, THAT WE ALL UNWITTINGLY HELPED MAKE HAPPEN
5921
ALL CONCENTRATED THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF ONE HOSTILE AGENT IN THE SYSTEM, WITH AN INSTINCT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING IT HATED
5921
AND THEN GIVEN THE POWER TO DO SO.
5922
AND UNLIKE A NORMAL DISEASE, IT WOULDN'T GRADUALLY KILL ITS HOST FROM WITHIN
5922
THE CANCER LEFT THE BODY
5922
CHASED OUT, AS IF BY AN IMMUNE SYSTEM.
5922
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
5922
IT WASN'T ANY LESS DEADLY ON THE OUTSIDE
5922
AND NO LESS DETERMINED TO FINISH THE JOB.
5923
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT COULD BE
5923
WHAT'S WAITING FOR US AT THE END OF THE COUNTDOWN.
5923
JACK WAS EXPELLED FROM YOUR SESSION SOMEHOW
5923
HE THEN METHODICALLY DESTROYED ALL OUR PLANETS, PROSPIT AND DERSE, AND TRIED TO WIPE US ALL OUT
5923
SO THAT WE COULDN'T DO THE SAME THING TO HIM AGAIN
5923
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS SAVING HIS TRUE TARGET FOR LAST
5923
THE ONE HE HATED MOST.
5923
JACK WAS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE DISEASE ALL ALONG.
5924
NOIR IS THE CANCER.
5925
IT'S HIM.
5926
ANYWAY
5926
THAT'S THE END OF HOW EVERYTHING'S MY FAULT COMPLETELY, AND I'M GARBAGE.
5926
HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT JADE! NOT THAT YOU SEEM TO RECALL THIS MEMO EVEN EXISTS.
5926
IF YOU SEE KANAYA IN DEATHBUBBLE HELL, PLEASE TELL HER I'M SORRY I LET HER DOWN.
5926
AND IF YOU SEE SOLLUX WANDERING AROUND TOO, LET HIM KNOW HOW ASHAMED I AM I DITCHED HIM LIKE A COWARD BECAUSE I HEARD A HORN GO HONK.
5926
AND TEREZI
5926
IF YOU SEE HER
5926
COULD YOU GIVE HER A MESSAGE FOR ME?
5926
TELL HER THAT
5926
ACTUALLY
5926
NEVER MIND.
5926
I'LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ALL IN PERSON SOON.
5926
SEEING AS AN IDIOT IN MAKEUP IS ABOUT TO ROLL OVER MY NAKED SQUEAL PIPETTE WITH A ONE WHEEL DEVICE.
5926
HOLY SHIT
5926
YOU'RE ALIVE
6001
THE PASSWORD IS
6001
SEE YOU SOON
6001
OK UH
6001
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR LACK OF RESPONSE AS TACIT VERIFICATION.
6001
ALSO
6001
THIS PRETTY MUCH HAS TO BE THE LAST CONVERSATION WE HAVE, RIGHT?
6001
YOUR TIMELINE CUTS OUT COMPLETELY IN A MINUTE OR TWO BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCH.
6001
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT UP THERE?
6001
ARE YOU HYPNOTIZED BY THE FLASHY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK.
6001
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE JOHN STARTED SCRATCHING THAT BIG GODDAMN RECORD, AREN'T YOU ACCLIMATED TO IT BY NOW?
6001
HELLO????????????
6001
HARLEY, JEGUS MOTHER OF SCREAMING FUCK.
6001
WHATEVER, I HAVE SHIT TO DO NOW.
6001
I GUESS I SHOULD BE KEEPING AN EYE IN THE SKY TOO NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.
6001
THE BRIGHT GREEN BEACON SHOULD BE APPEARING ANY MINUTE, ASSUMING YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO BLOW UP THE SUN.
6001
AND THEN
6001
WELL, THEN I GUESS MAYBE WE ALL GET TO HANG OUT?
6001
WHILE MAYBE ALSO NOT BEING IN UNYIELDING MORTAL PERIL???
6001
IT'S GETTING KIND OF OLD, FRANKLY.
6001
OK, WELL THIS IS A PRETTY CRAPPY FAREWELL, BUT I GUESS IT'LL HAVE TO DO SINCE THERE IS SOME SERIOUSLY SHOW-STOPPING SHIT TRANSPIRING UP THERE IN FUCKING OUTER SPACE.
6001
LATER JADE, I'M GOING TO GO MAKE SURE JOHN KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.
6001
AND IN CASE NONE OF THIS WORKS AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO MEET
6001
I GUESS I SHOULD SAY...
6001
SINCE APPARENTLY MY GUTLESS FUTURE SELF CAN'T EXPRESS HIMSELF AND NEVER GOT AROUND TO SAYING SO
6001
THUS LEAVING IT UP TO ME AS USUAL
6001
TO SAY
6001
THAT
6001
OH
6001
WHAT
6002
WHAT.
6004
WHAT THE HELL IS SHAVING CREAM.
6249
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
6250
IS IT GOING TO SHIT ON EVERYBODY'S GREAT TIME IF I DARE TO BRING UP IMPORTANT THINGS NOW?
6250
IS IT SAFE TO POKE OUR HEADS UP FROM THIS GULCH OF IDIOTIC BANTER AND SEE IF THE COAST IS CLEAR FOR ADULT, BUSINESSLIKE CONVERSATION?
6250
YES, YES, HUMANS, SO NICE TO MEET YOU, AND IT SEEMS YOU'RE GOD TIERS NOW? NEAT, YADA YADA, WHAT THE FUCK EVER.
6250
JUST ONE QUESTION
6250
WE FOLLOWED THAT GREEN BEACON OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE AFTERMATH OF A SUCCESSFUL BLOW UP THE SUN MISSION
6250
AND AFTER A BREAKNECK WARP SPEED JOURNEY IN WHICH MY BEST FUCKING FRIEND *EVER* PSYCHED ME OUT INTO THINKING HE DIED *YET A FUCKING GAIN* BY EXPELLING LITER AFTER GRUESOME LITER OF GRUBSAUCE FROM HIS EVERY ORIFICE
6250
WHAT DO I FIND HERE?
6250
WHY, IN ADDITION TO A PAIR OF HUMANS DRAPED IN CIRCUSWEAR AND ALL THEIR FLIPPANT GIBES LOCKED AND GODDAMN LOADED
6250
IT SEEMS WE HAVE ALSO CHANCED UPON NONE OTHER THAN THE GREEN FUCKING SUN ITSELF
6250
WHICH UNLESS MY RAW, RUDDY GANDERBULBS ARE STILL A LITTLE GRIEFBLEARY, STRIKES ME AS STILL BEING SOMEWHAT RATHER FUCKING *UNBLOWN* UP.
6250
SO WHAT AM I MISSING HERE
6250
OH!
6250
CASE CLOSED
6250
OK THEN, LET'S START PITCHING DEAD PALS INTO THE LIMITLESS INFERNO. MY CURIOSITY WAS TOTALLY FUCKING SATED JUST THEN!
6250
AH! MORE BREATHTAKING REASSURANCE!
6250
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE GUYS, WE WERE JUST HORNSWOGGLED AND MISINFORMED, CARRY ON THEN!
6250
WASN'T THE WHOLE POINT TO TAKE OUT THE SUN TO NEUTRALIZE JACK?
6250
OH NO??? THEN WHAT'S THE PLAN NOW???
6250
OH! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
6250
FUCKING OH.
6250
AND HERE I THOUGHT THE NEW PLAN WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING INCREDIBLY STUPID AND SUICIDAL.
6250
DID I SAY OH YET?
6250
BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOUND I MAKE WHEN I'M FUCKING RELIEVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6250
WHAT.
6250
WHAT DOES HONK MEAN THIS TIME YOU WHIMSICAL PIECE OF SHIT?????
6250
DON'T YOU START WITH ME
6250
DO. NOT. START WITH ME.
6250
I WILL GET YOU IN A HEADLOCK SO TIGHT IT WILL BE A MIRACLE IF PEOPLE DON'T MISTAKE OUR TUSSLE FOR AN ILL CONCEIVED VENTRILOQUIST ACT.
6250
I WILL SHOOSH YOU AGAIN, SO HELP ME GOD. I WILL SHOOSH YOUR CLOWN ASS TO SHANGRI-BULLSHIT-LA AND BACK, AND FILL YOUR EAR WITH MY WHITE HOT PALEBRO SPITTLE.
6250
I AM FULL AND FUCKING WELL PREPARED TO GET CONCILIATORY WITH YOU AGAIN IF YOU SO MUCH AS PASS GAS MURDEROUSLY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
6250
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT??? DO I NEED TO CALM YOUR FAYGO-STICKY TENTSQUATTING SHIT DOWN AGAIN????
6250
OK
6250
OK YEAH
6250
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
6250
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULD RELAX.
6250
AND BREATHE.
6250
I MEAN, WHAT ARE MOIRAILS FOR, RIGHT?
6250
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, I STOP YOU FROM KILLING EVERYBODY, THEN YOU RETURN THE FAVOR AND CALM ME DOWN AND I JUST
6250
BREATHE
6250
LIKE
6250
THIS...
6250
SNIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFFFUCK, THAT SUN IS BRIGHT.
6250
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO RELAX WITHIN A STONE'S THROW FROM, OH, I GUESS ONLY THE BIGGEST FUCKING STAR ANY MORTAL HAS EVER LAID EYES ON.
6250
SURE, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR YOU.
6250
BUT I MEAN, CAN THIS BE HEALTHY?
6250
AREN'T WE GOING TO GET BURNED OR HAVE OUR RETINAS SCORCHED BY LOOKING AT IT?
6250
OH GOD I THINK I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK.
6250
FUCK YOU
6250
I CAN'T BREATHE...
6250
IT'S SO BRIGHT, I NEED SUNGLASSES OR SOMETHING.
6250
QUICK, WHICH ONE OF YOU AWESOME DUDES HAS A RADICAL PAIR OF SHADES I CAN BORROW???
6252
I WAS JOKING, GET THOSE FUCKING THINGS AWAY FROM ME
6253
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW
6253
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
6253
WHO'S THE LEADER NOW?
6253
ARADIA ARE YOU THE LEADER NOW
6253
OR IS IT ROSE "I HAVE AN IDEA, LET'S TAKE THE INVINCIBLE DEMON HEAD ON!" LALONDE.
6253
I NEED TO KNOW WHO THE LEADER IS
6253
I NEED TO KNOW IN WHOSE DIRECTION I MUST BEHAVE AS THE MOST PATHETICALLY USELESS SUBORDINATE I CAN BE.
6253
QUICK, SOMEONE BOSS ME AROUND! I'M FUCKING INCOMPETENT AND RARING TO GO.
6253
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN THERE'S A LEADER AROUND TRYING TO MAKE PLANS, RIGHT?
6253
YOU DROP YOUR IQ HARDER THAN A PAIR OF HILARIOUSLY PLUMMETING PANTS, YOU CEASELESSLY RAMBLE ABOUT VAPID BULLSHIT, YOU RUN AROUND HIDING ALL OF YOUR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS IN TREASURE CHESTS, AND THEN EVERYONE STARTS MURDERING EACH OTHER.
6253
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE CHARACTERIZING LEADERSHIP, IT'S ONE I SURE AS FUCK NEVER HAD!
6253
SO I NEED TO KNOW WHO THE LEADER IS.
6253
STRIDER, IS IT YOU???
6254
OH WOW, I WOULD OFFER A RETORT TO YOUR VICIOUS BARB, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT UNLIKE EVERY ASSHOLE EVER, I CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW ORDERS AND SHUT MY MOUTH!
6254
CHECK IT OUT, "DOGG"
6254
......................................
6255
PPPFFUUUUUUUHHHHHHH......... WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE...
6255
YEAH
6255
SO?
6255
OK YEAH
6255
I MEAN, OF COURSE IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT
6255
STFU.
6255
LOOK I'M JUST A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE AT STAYING QUIET FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME, OK?
6255
ANYWAY, WHATEVER, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LALONDE IS
6255
WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THIS HORRIBLE ROCK A GOOD WHILE LONGER TO GET TO THIS PARADISE SESSION OR WHATEVER IT IS?
6255
AND SINCE WE PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO FORCE SOLLUX'S BULLSHIT "HALF GHOST" OR WHATEVER TO POP HIMSELF AGAIN LIKE A PACKET OF NASTY FETID MUSTARD SO HE CAN SHOOT THIS THING INTO HYPERSPACE...
6255
I'M GUESSING THAT MEANS IT'LL TAKE CONSIDERABLY LONGER TO GET THERE THAN IT DID TO GET HERE?
6255
I JUST KNEW IT
6255
THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE REALIZED
6255
WHEN WE FIRST FLED TO THIS METEOR I HAD THIS WEIRD FEELING WE'D WIND UP SPENDING FOREVER AT THIS MISERABLE PLACE, ASSUMING WE ACTUALLY SURVIVED.
6255
I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK, HOW LONG IS THIS TRIP GOING TO TAKE?
6255
PROBABLY SOME ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS AMOUNT OF TIME, LIKE THREE LONG MADDENING SWEEPS, RIGHT???
6255
WOULDN'T THAT JUST BE SO COSMICALLY CONVENIENT AND PERFECT FOR EVERYBODY! ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE OF ALL, MY UNINTERRUPTED CONTINUUM OF PERSONAL AGONY!!!
6255
THANK YOU, DARK GODS! THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!! YOU WIN THIS ROUND! YOU WIN ALL THE ROUNDS APPARENTLY!!!!! THERE ARE NO ROUNDS EVEN. THERE'S JUST YOUR SLIMY TENDRILS, OUR NAKED BODIES, AND EPOCHS OF MOLESTATION.
6255
OH
6255
OK
6255
THAT'S NOT SO BAD I GUESS.
6255
WAIT, HOW LONG ARE YEARS SUPPOSED TO BE AGAIN?
6255
WAS IT LIKE TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING?
6255
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
6256
WAIT, WHAT?
6256
NO COME ON, DON'T BE LIKE THAT
6256
YOU'RE A *HALF* GHOST, ASSHOLE.
6256
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? HOW ARE YOU EVEN TAKING THIS IDIOTIC "HALF DEATH" SERIOUSLY IF YOU JUST GO HOG WILD AS A FUCKING WHOLE-GHOST, AND SAY STUPID SHIT LIKE, BLAH BLAH, I BELONG IN THE AFTERLIFE NOW LIKE A DUMBASS.
6256
WHATEVER, FINE.
6256
I'M GOING BACK TO NOT BREATHING AGAIN.
6256
HHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUP.............
6256
(sollux, oh my god is it me or is everybody already just fucking hitting on each other left and right? oh god i can't take sweeps of this shit, don't leave me alone here, please don't)
6256
FUCK!
6256

6257
SOLLUX, WHERE DID YOUR BODY GO???
6257
WAIT A MINUTE.
6257
WAIT JUST A FUCKING MINUTE, WHERE'S...
6257
SHIT
6257
VRISKA'S BODY IS GONE TOO!
6257
WHERE ARE THEY?
6257
DID ANYONE SEE WHAT HAPPENED??
6257
DAMMIT, WHEN THE FUCK WILL I LEARN NOT TO TURN MY BACK ON THE BODIES.
6257
HOLD ON
6257
OH NO, WHERE'S GAMZEE
6257
OHHHH FUCK
6257
NO, FUCK NO, FUCK THAT CORPSE HOARDING SACK OF HORRIBLE GARBAGE.
6257
NICE GUESS SHIT HEAD!
6257
YEAH, HE DOES THIS
6257
HE SORT OF COLLECTS BODIES AND DECAPITATES THEM AND STUFF
6257
STICKS THEM IN BIG SCIENCE JARS, FOR SOME REASON??
6257
NO NO NO I'M NOT LISTENING TO SHIT LIKE THAT, I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR THAT.
6257
IT'S LIKE
6257
YOU KNOW HOW EVERY NOW AND THEN YOUR LUSUS WILL BRING SOME RANDOM ASS DEAD ANIMAL BACK TO YOUR HIVE FOR NO FUCKING REASON
6257
AND THEY DON'T EVER STOP DOING THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU YELL
6257
IT'S LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
6257
YES, THERE YOU GO.
6257
KANAYA WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
6259
OH NO...
6259
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
6259
I MEAN WHO EVEN REALLY CARES IF HE STOLE MORE BODIES.
6259
HE CAN HAVE THEM FRANKLY, AS LONG AS IT KEEPS HIM OUT OF TROUBLE.
6259
WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A FUCKING CORPSE PARTY, SERIOUSLY, FUCK THAT DUMB IDEA.
6259
ALRIGHT IF YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO
6259
JUST
6259
BE CAREFUL
6259
NO MORE POINTLESS BLOODSHED, OK? THAT'S AN ORDER!
6259
WAIT FUCK
6259
I'M NOT LEADER ANYMORE
6259
ROSE CAN YOU ORDER HER TO DO THAT?
6259
SAY WHAT I JUST SAID, REALLY ANGRILY
6259
ASSUMING YOU CAN EVEN *BE* ANGRY.
6259
WAIT
6259
GUYS SOMETHING'S HAPPENING...
6259
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON NOW???
6260
HOLY
6261
FUCKING
6262
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
6263
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
6264
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
6265
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.
6285
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME TO HIT THE FUCKING ROAD THEN
6285
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS THING GO ANYWAY. DOES IT HAVE ROCKETS OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT??
6285
WHAT, SO JUST ONE "PUSH" IS GOING TO LAST THREE YEARS?
6285
LET ALONE OUTRUN JACK?? BULLSHIT.
6285
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW THAT?
6285
OK, WHATEVER, LET'S JUST GET ON WITH IT.
6285
IN THE MEANTIME WE SHOULD SET UP SOME SORT OF CHECKPOINT PERIMETER AROUND THE DEAD MAYOR GUY.
6285
JUST SO GAMZEE DOESN'T TRY TO HOARD HIS BODY OR CHOP OFF HIS HEAD.
6285
HE'S THE DULY ELECTED MAYOR OF THE FRUITY RUMPUS ASSHOLE FACTORY, AND HE JUST CUT THE RIBBON TO A BRAND NEW MUSEUM FULL OF PRICELESS SHUT THE FUCK UP.
6285
HOW'S THAT?
6585
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS MEMO BULLSHIT AGAIN.
6585
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
6585
I JUST NEED TO AIR OUT SOME SHIT WITH SOMEBODY, AND EVERYONE HERE HAS THEIR HEADS SO FAR UP THEIR NOOKS I WANT TO SCREAM LOUDER THAN I USUALLY DO.
6585
THEIR TROLL NOOKS *AND* HUMAN NOOKS, WHATEVER THE HELL A HUMAN NOOK EVEN *IS*.
6585
YOU KNOW?
6586
HEY, ARE YOU THERE?
6586
FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK.
6586
OH...
6586
HEY
6586
I CAN'T
6586
I JUST CANNOT
6586
*FUCKING*
6586
***BELIEVE***
6586
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS BULLSHIT AGAIN WITH YOU/ME.
6586
WHAT THE FUCK MADE ME THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA???
6586
DUDE, WHAT'S WITH THE TEXT?
6586
UUUUUGH.
6586
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME!
6586
I JUST HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE PREMONITION YOU'RE ABOUT TO ANYWAY.
6586
WHY THE FUCK WOULD I KNOW WHY YOU CHANGED YOUR TEXT RED!
6586
WE DON'T DO THAT. THE SHOWY, SELF-ABSORBED "PAINT YOUR TEXT IN YOUR BLOOD COLOR" THING. OR EYE COLOR, OR WHATEVER.
6586
IT'S FOR ATTENTION-GREEDY, INSECURE LOSERS.
6586
SURE IS!
6586
HMM.
6586
?????? <- SARCASTIC WONDER.
6586
I'M JUST THINKING
6586
THIS REALLY MAKES OUR CONVERSATIONS EASIER TO READ.
6586
REMEMBER THOSE INSANE BLOCKS OF GRAY ANGRY TEXT WE USED TO WRITE TOGETHER.
6586
WHAT WAS THAT
6586
LIKE HALF A SWEEP AGO ALREADY?
6586
IS IT WEIRD THAT I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK ON ALL THAT INSANITY WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FONDNESS?
6586
AT LEAST SHIT WAS HAPPENING.
6586
IT'S SO BORING OUT HERE. AND LIVING WITH THE HUMANS IS JUST GETTING KIND OF
6586
WEIRD.
6586
ANYWAY, THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOT MORE DECIPHERABLE. MAYBE YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING.
6586
WELL HEY, CHECK IT OUT: SHIT JUST GOT NOSTALGIC.
6586
LOOK AT THAT, I'M FEELING MORE SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS MORONIC CONVERSATION ALREADY.
6586
OK, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO FROM ZERO TO DOUCHE LIKE IN THE BLINK OF A FUCKING GLANCE NUGGET.
6586
THE BLINK OF A GLANCE NUGGET?? I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR TEN MINUTES ALREADY. AND COUNTING!
6586
I JUST THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON TO SOMETHING WITH THE RED TEXT. I WAS TRYING TO PAY YOU A COMPLIMENT YOU ANTAGONIZING FUCK.
6586
I MEAN, WE ONLY EVER GOT IN THE HABIT OF TYPING IN GRAY TO HIDE OUR BLOOD COLOR, RIGHT?
6586
AND LIKE, 1) EVERYBODY KNOWS IT NOW, IT WAS THE WORST KEPT FUCKING SECRET EVER, AND 2) EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T, IT'S JUST US HERE, AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BOTH ALREADY KNOWN IT ALL OUR LIVES
6586
UNLESS WE'RE BOTH SO NEUROTIC WE ACTUALLY STILL WANT TO ACT LIKE ITS A SECRET WE'RE KEEPING FROM EACH OTHER...
6586
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THE DAYS OF THAT ASTOUNDING DEGREE OF MENTAL ILLNESS ARE BEHIND US!
6586
(I WANT TO KILL MYSELF, BUT I CAN'T UNTIL THE CONVERSATION RUNS ITS COURSE. THIS IS THE WORST HELL IMAGINABLE.)
6586
SHUT THE FUCK UP. THAT'S THE EXACT KIND OF MELODRAMA I'M TALKING ABOUT, WE'RE BETTER THAN THAT NOW MAN.
6586
I'M GONNA DO THE *MATURE* THING HERE: AND SWITCH MY TEXT TO RED.
6586
THERE. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE THE UNIVERSAL CONVENTION FOR WHEN TWO OF THE SAME PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER.
6586
ONE GUY BITES THE BULLET AND TALKS IN RED.
6586
SERIOUSLY, ONE OF US HAS TO BE THE GROWN UP HERE.
6586
OH! I GET IT NOW.
6586
WHEN I TYPE IN RED, IT'S SHOWY AND INSECURE, BUT WHEN YOU DO IT, YOU ARE SHOULDERING THE PRAGMATIC BURDEN OF A MARTYR, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS *MY* FUCKING IDEA TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE TEN MINUTES AGO!
6586
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
6586
OK!!! GOD DAMMIT, STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE. I FUCKING APOLOGIZE.
6586
CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR STUPID FEELINGS ALREADY SO WE CAN GET THIS NIGHTMARE OVER WITH.
6587
WELL LOOK, IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THIS LOPSIDED THING WHERE I SPILL ALL MY FEELINGS INTO IDIOTSPACE WHILE SOME SHIT HEAD YELLS AT ME.
6587
I WAS KIND OF THINKING THERE WOULD BE SOME GIVE AND TAKE, SINCE YOU PRESUMABLY SHARE A LOT OF MY THOUGHTS??
6587
OK WHATEVER. JUST SAY SOME STUFF ALREADY. ALL THAT SHIT I SAID TEN MINUTES AGO.
6587
I WILL "RIFF" WITH YOU AND SOMEHOW PRETEND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I'M REHASHING A BUNCH OF LINES WRITTEN IN BARELY DRIED INK!!!
6587
OK
6587
WELL
6587
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME EVEN PUTTING MY THOUGHTS INTO WORDS ABOUT THIS BIZARRE TREK THROUGH THE RING.
6587
AT FIRST IT WAS JUST BLAND AND UNEVENTFUL. BUT THAT WAS KIND OF A RELIEF, REMEMBER?
6587
NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING KILLED ALL THE TIME, OR TRYING TO RALLY A BUNCH OF UNCOOPERATIVE TROOPS TOWARD AN IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTIVE.
6587
YEAH.
6587
BUT THEN
6587
AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT SOMETIMES WE VISIT THESE CRAZY DREAM BUBBLES WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP...
6587
WE STARTED PHYSICALLY PASSING THROUGH THEM TOO.
6588
LIKE I THINK I COULD HANDLE IT BETTER IF IT WAS JUST ONE THING OR THE OTHER.
6588
LIKE *ONLY* THE MONOTONOUS DAY TO DAY DRUDGERY ON THE SAME GLOOMY FUCKING METEOR WITH THE SAME BUNCH OF RIDICULOUS PEOPLE, AND BASICALLY NOTHING TO DO EVER EXCEPT GET ALL UP IN EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS.
6588
OR *ONLY* A SWEEPS LONG SAFARI THROUGH AN EPHEMERAL REALM OF GHOST MEMORIES AND DEAD FRIENDS SHITTING AROUND IN A HAPHAZARD EXISTENTIAL CLUSTERFUCK.
6588
BUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH BOTH, IN TOTALLY RANDOM INTERVALS?
6588
IT'S KIND OF TAKING ITS TOLL.
6588
"I HEAR YOU MAN."
6588
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT.
6588
BUT FOR THE RECORD, I GUESS I MEANT IT.
6588
YEAH.
6588
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
6588
I MISS ALL OF MY DEAD FRIENDS A LOT.
6588
EVEN THE ASSHOLES! I MISS THEM TOO. MAYBE EVEN ESPECIALLY THEM, IN SOME PERVERSE WAY.
6588
AND I SHOULD BE RELIEVED THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO BE HAPPY IN SOME WAY, EVEN IF IT'S BY FLOATING NEBULOUSLY THROUGH DREAM PROJECTIONS WITH THEIR FREAKY BLANK EYES.
6588
AND I GUESS I AM RELIEVED ABOUT THAT.
6588
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S LEFT ME UNSETTLED.
6588
FOR REASONS I CAN'T REALLY PUT MY FINGER ON.
6589
I KNOW WHY.
6589
YOU DO?
6589
YEAH.
6589
WELL OF COURSE YOU DO.
6589
I GUESS BECAUSE I JUST TOLD YOU TEN MINUTES AGO, MAKING IT LIKE A SELF-FULFILLING EPIPHANY??
6589
WELL THERE'S THAT
6589
BUT ALSO THIS CONVERSATION HELPED CLARIFY SOME THOUGHTS TOO, IN SPITE OF ITS EXCRUCIATING POINTLESSNESS.
6589
PART OF WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT MORTALITY.
6589
YEAH
6589
I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.
6589
AFTER VISITING WHO KNOWS HOW MANY DREAM BUBBLES
6589
AND HANGING OUT WITH WHO KNOWS HOW MANY DEAD FRIENDS, AND *COPIES* OF DEAD FRIENDS FROM ALTERNATE TIMELINES...
6589
I START TO WONDER, DOES DEATH EVEN REALLY MEAN ANYTHING?
6589
DID LIFE MEAN ANYTHING, FOR THAT MATTER??
6589
WAS THE POINT OF LIFE TO JUST GO AROUND COLLECTING A BUNCH OF PAINFUL AND AWKWARD EXPERIENCES TO SUPPLY MATERIAL FOR THE REVOLVING MEMORY-COLLAGE THAT SERVES AS THE BACKDROP TO A MUCH LONGER, EMPTIER STRETCH OF EXISTENCE?
6589
AND HOW UNNERVING IS IT RUNNING INTO OUR DEAD DOPPELGANGERS FROM DOOMED TIMELINES?
6589
HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR, BRO.
6589
IT'S FUCKED UP.
6589
NEVER MIND WHAT IT MEANS ABOUT A PERSON'S IDENTITY OR SENSE OF SELF, OR WHICH GUY GETS TO BE CONSIDERED "THE REAL GUY" OR PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT LIKE THAT.
6589
JUST ON THE LEVEL OF WHAT YOUR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS DURING YOUR LIFE ACTUALLY MEAN.
6589
SOMETIMES WE RUN INTO THESE VERSIONS OF OURSELVES WHO REACHED GOD TIER FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
6589
BUT IN SPITE OF BEING *MORE* SUCCESSFUL THAN WE WERE, BY THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE MEASURE
6589
THEY GET PUNISHED FOR THAT, BECAUSE IT WASN'T "THE THING THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN"??
6590
PRETTY MUCH.
6590
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?
6590
IF WE ARE TO TAKE SOME LESSON FROM THAT, WHAT IS IT!
6590
"TRY TO BE GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL, BUT MAYBE NOT TOOOO GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL?"
6590
OR MAYBE DON'T TRY AT ALL IN SOME CASES! BECAUSE IF YOU DO, SOME GIANT FUCKING SQUID IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IS GOING TO BE LIKE, NOT SO FAST, MY HIDEOUS MONSTER PLANS BEG TO DIFFER.
6590
DON'T YOU THINK WE'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF IF WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS DREAM BUBBLE SHIT?
6590
WELL.
6590
YEAH.
6590
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING TEN MINUTES AGO.
6590
BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
6590
YEAH, WELL AT LEAST YOU'RE LISTENING. EVEN IF YOU WERE BEING YOUR USUAL SHITTY SELF ABOUT IT.
6590
NOBODY ELSE EVEN GETS THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
6590
LIKE TEREZI?
6590
IT USED TO BE THAT SHE WOULD AT LEAST HUMOR EVEN MY MOST LUDICROUS, VITRIOLIC GARBAGE ALL THE TIME.
6590
REMEMBER THOSE DAYS?
6590
WAY BACK BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW WHAT A HUMAN WAS.
6590
BACK ON ALTERNIA WHEN MY BIGGEST FEAR WAS IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT I WAS A MUTANT. HOW QUAINT CAN YOU FUCKING GET?
6590
I WAS AN IDIOT NOT TO UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD THINGS WERE BACK THEN.
6590
BETWEEN US.
6590
NOW IT'S LIKE...
6590
SDJS;ALSKJFSA;JK
6590
WHAT?
6590
THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
6591
OH GET OVER YOURSELF, OUR TEN MINUTES IS ALMOST UP.
6591
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW.
6591
IS SHE PUNISHING ME FOR SOMETHING?
6591
I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU HOW MUCH TIME SHE SPENDS GALLIVANTING AROUND THE METEOR WITH YOU KNOW WHO.
6591
NO YOU SURE AS FUCK DO NOT.
6591
AFTER ALL THIS TIME I *STILL* CAN'T TELL IF SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT THAT, OR DOING IT TO FUCK WITH ME.
6591
WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THERE SOMETHING LEGITIMATELY RED GOING ON THERE?
6591
HOW CAN I COMMAND SUCH ABSOLUTE MASTERY OVER THE ROMANTIC SCIENCES YET REMAIN PERPLEXED BY THIS???
6591
MAYBE I CAN'T GET A READ BECAUSE HE'S NOT A TROLL, AND THEREFORE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK HE'S DOING?
6591
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DECIPHER AN INTRICATE COURTSHIP PROCESS BETWEEN AN ATTRACTIVE POTENTIAL MATESPRIT, AND SOME SORT OF VEGETABLE.
6591
LIKE IT DOESN'T COMPUTE.
6591
FUCK, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING LISTENING TO THIS, MAKE IT STOP.
6591
QUIET, I'M TALKING.
6591
I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE I'M PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN WITH HER.
6591
WHERE BEFORE THERE WAS MARGIN FOR ERROR, PROBABLY WAY MORE THAN I EVER DESERVED.
6591
AND NOW THAT'S IT. SHE'S TOTALLY HAD IT, AND THERE'S A NEW DUDE WITH CANDYBLOOD IN TOWN.
6591
HE'S JUST GOT IT ALL, DOESN'T HE? HE'S A MUCH BETTER ARTIST THAN I AM, FOR ONE THING.
6591
AND HIS HORNS ARE SO NUBBY, THEY DON'T EVEN EXIST! TALK ABOUT HITTING THE JACKPOT.
6591
AM I OFF BASE??
6591
WE JUST WENT OVER THIS.
6591
I DIDN'T GET IT THEN BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY WHINING AND FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF LIKE YOU'RE DOING NOW SO PIPE DOWN AND LISTEN.
6592
YOU'VE BEEN SENDING HER AN ENDLESS STREAM OF MIXED SIGNALS FOR AS LONG AS YOU'VE KNOWN HER.
6592
OH BULLSHIT.
6592
LIKE FUCK IT'S BULLSHIT.
6592
IT'S ALL TOO CLEAR TO ME NOW. IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF QUADRANT VACILLATION, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
6592
NO WONDER SHE WAS FRUSTRATED AND GOT FED UP WITH YOU.
6592
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
6592
IS IT?? TELL ME, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TREATED HER IN A WAY THAT COULD BE OBJECTIVELY CONSTRUED AS A FORM OF BLACK SOLICITATION?
6592
THAT'S JUST
6592
NO, THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS ROLLED TOGETHER. IT'S LIKE
6592
SPIRITED PLATONIC CONTENTION.
6592
TOTALLY NORMAL TERRITORY IN A HEALTHY MATESPRITSHIP.
6592
YEAH, A *HEALTHY* ONE, NOT ONE INVOLVING A DEMENTED LOUDMOUTH WHO CAN'T KEEP HIS SHIT UNDER CONTROL.
6592
LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MUCH OF THAT ANIMOSITY IS INNOCENT "PLATONIC RAGE"?
6592
COULD IT BE THAT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU WANT TO PUSH THINGS WITH HER ONTO CALIGINOUS TURF, MAYBE SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT THERE?
6592
SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR GRUB, AND CULL IT TOO??
6592
THAT WAY YOU HAVE HER ALL TO YOURSELF!
6592
FUCK YOU.
6592
YOU WANT HER IN EVERY QUADRANT LIKE A DESPERATE FOOL.
6592
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE BECOME? YOU ARE THE SAD JOKE CHARACTER IN THE ROMCOM, YOU KNOW THE GUY I'M TALKING ABOUT.
6592
WHO'S GREEDY AND INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT FILLING EVERY QUADRANT, TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO IT, AND IN THE END HAS FUCKALL TO SHOW FOR IT.
6592
I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS.
6592
YOU KIND OF DO, FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES.
6592
NO, FUCK THAT, I'M SO DONE WITH YOU.
6592
YEAH, YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE, BECAUSE THE TEN MINUTES ARE ABOUT UP, AND I'LL BE GONE.
6592
THEN IT'LL JUST BE YOU AND THE OTHER GUY, SPINNING YOUR GLOBES TOGETHER LIKE A COUPLE STUPID PIECES OF SHIT, AD INFINITUM.
6593
MAN, I MUST HAVE BEEN INSANE TO THINK ANYTHING IS DIFFERENT.
6593
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL, YOU'RE JUST AS PETTY AND HORRIBLE AS EVER.
6593
FUCK YOU FOREVER. FUCK EVERY TEN-MINUTES-AHEAD VERSION OF MYSELF ALL THE WAY INTO TEN-MINUTE-FUCKING-ETERNITY.
6593
I CAN'T EVEN DO THIS, NOT ANY MORE.
6593
YEAH, WELL YOU MADE YOUR COCOON, PAL. NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE TURNS SHITTING IN IT, TOGETHER. IT IS THE MOST PATHETIC, SMELLIEST DANCE OF ALL.
6593
HMM.
6593
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT NOW?
6593
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME
6593
THIS DUMB TANTRUM I THREW
6593
THIS ENTIRE BAD MOOD...
6593
IT WAS JUST ANOTHER IDIOTIC SELF-FULFILLING REACHAROUND WASN'T IT.
6593
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??
6593
I MEAN, WHERE DID THIS EVEN COME FROM?
6593
IT WAS LIKE SPONTANEOUSLY GENERATING SELF-LOATHING WITH NO DISCERNIBLE SOURCE.
6593
WAS THIS EMOTIONAL OUTBURST EVER EVEN REAL?
6593
OH NO, DON'T EVEN START WITH THAT.
6593
DO *NOT* START GETTING EXISTENTIAL ABOUT MY ANGER.
6593
YOU BETTER FUCKING BELIEVE THIS IS REAL.
6593
ARE YOU SURE, MAN?

6593
SORRY, THIS WAS MY FAULT. I'M GOING TO GO TRY AND CALM MYSELF DOWN.
6593
OH, SO THIS IS WHY YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION???
6593
YOU GOT OWNED, SO YOU HAD TO SLINK AWAY LIKE A FUCKING COWARD??????
6593
NICE TRY SHIT HEAD, BUT I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET. YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN LIST HIS 10-MINUTE-AWAY-SELF'S FLAWS??
6593
I COULD GO ON FOREVER!
6593
FINE, GET OUT OF HERE! GOOD RIDDANCE!
6593
AS IF I COULD TAKE ANOTHER SPONGE WRINGING MINUTE OF YOUR DISINGENUOUS DRIVEL.
6593
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS MEMO BULLSHIT AGAIN.
6593
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
6593
I JUST NEED TO AIR OUT SOME SHIT WITH SOMEBODY, AND EVERYONE HERE HAS THEIR HEADS SO FAR UP THEIR NOOKS I WANT TO SCREAM LOUDER THAN I USUALLY DO.
6593
THEIR TROLL NOOKS *AND* HUMAN NOOKS, WHATEVER THE HELL A HUMAN NOOK EVEN *IS*.
6593
YOU KNOW?

HEY, ARE YOU THERE?

*FUCKING*
6594
***BELIEVE***
6594
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS BULLSHIT AGAIN WITH YOU/ME.
6594
WHAT THE FUCK MADE ME THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA???
6594
DUDE, WHAT'S WITH THE TEXT?
6594
UUUUUGH.
6594
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME!
6594
I JUST HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE PREMONITION YOU'RE ABOUT TO ANYWAY.
6609
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE GODDAMN WAY.
6609
I GOT A LAB FULL OF HUMANS, A MOUTH FULL OF YELLING, AND A TORTURED PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE FULL OF TOTALLY HYSTERICAL EMOTIONS AND UNAIRED GRIEVANCES AT PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY.
6609
YEAH
6609
OK HOLD ON
6609
IF I CAN SETTLE DOWN A TICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE SENSE SHORTLY
6609
JUST ONE...
6609
*huff huff*
6609
FUCK...
6609
*wheeze*
6609
NO
6609
WOW OK
6609
THAT WAS A PRETTY TERRIBLE ENTRANCE.
6609
ANYWAY
6609
WHERE WAS I.
6610
NOT SO FAST STRIDER, THIS HEAVILY CONCERNS YOU.
6610
IT CONCERNS YOU EXCLUSIVELY IN FACT.
6610
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?
6610
LIKE MY INFLAMED QUAKING GALLSPHINCTER IT'S NOT.
6610
TELL ME, ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE GOING TO HAVE SOME COMPANY WHEN YOU STEP OUT TO DO THIS "THING?"
6610
NOTICE THE TWO HEAVILY DRAMATIZED "ENCLOSURE TALONS" SURROUNDING THAT WORD, WHICH I AM SCORNFULLY PANTOMIMING WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS, AS PRESENTLY BEING DEMONSTRATED FOR YOU.
6610
OH??
6610
WHO WOULD THAT BE MAY I ASK?
6610
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FUCKING MAYOR, AND YOU FUCKING KNOW IT.
6610
HE'S NOT A MAYOR. HE'S THE MAYOR OF FUCKSTICK JUNCTION LOCATED SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF PRETEND ASS NOWHERE.
6610
IT SAYS "MAYO" AND HE WROTE THE "R" HIMSELF.
6610
HE'S AT BEST A MAYO. AND WHO EVER HEARD OF A MAYO? IT'S EVERY BIT AS IMAGINARY AS HIS IDENTITY AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.
6610
WHO THE FUCK EVER HEARD OF GRUB SAUCE WITHOUT GRUBS??? WHAT'S IT MADE OF THEN GENIUS!
6610
ISN'T IT FUNNY HOW QUICKLY YOUR BULLSHIT UNRAVELS WHEN SOMEONE INTELLIGENT ACTUALLY HOLDS YOU ACCOUNTABLE??
6610
YOU ARE FUCKING BUSTED STRIDER.
6610
YOU ARE BUSTED ABOUT "MAYO" AND YOU ARE BUSTED ABOUT TEREZI.
6610
WHAT I DO WITH MY LEGS AND HOW FAST I MOVE THEM IS MY BUSINESS YOU SHIT.
6610
I SAID STAY YOUR ASS PUT, WE'RE TALKING HERE.
6610
WHAT
6611
OK, LOOK I'M NOWHERE NEAR YOUR PRECIOUS STUPID CAPE. JUST LISTEN.
6611
BEFORE YOU GO OFF TO SNOG TEREZI IN YOUR IDIOTIC LITTLE VILLAGE OF NUTRITION CYLINDERS, HEAR ME OUT.
6611
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT I AM!
6611
DAVE, CAN WE JUST CUT THE SHIT?
6611
I AM NOT AN IMBECILE. YOU ARE BOTH PLAINLY TIPPING INTO FLUSHED TERRITORY IRRESPECTIVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS OR WHATEVER LAME CONDITIONS IT IS HUMANS BELIEVE TO BE OPTIMAL FOR PURSUING A MATESPRITSHIP.
6611
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT, IT'S THE SHITTIEST KEPT SECRET ON THIS METEOR. PROBABLY EVEN THE FUCKING MAYOR GETS IT, AND LET'S FACE IT, HE'S A LITTLE SLOW.
6611
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD PULL THE WOOLBEAST MATERIAL OVER THE EYES OF A HARDENED VETERAN OF ROMANTIC STUDIES?
6611
I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF TROLL ROMANCE FILMS, EACH DEALING WITH TOPICS FAR MORE SUBTLE AND COMPLEX THAN YOUR PEDESTRIAN HUMAN MIND COULD EVER GRASP.
6611
AND IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, I'VE ALREADY WATCHED HUNDREDS OF YOUR MORE PRIMITIVE BUT MODERATELY ENTERTAINING ROMANCE FILMS.
6611
REMEMBER HOW I DOWNLOADED A FUCK TON OF THEM AFTER DISCOVERING YOUR SPECIES? I AM A CURIOUS MAN, DAVE, YOU COULD LEARN FROM ME.
6611
YOU'RE SEVERELY EXAGGERATING, BUT YES I HAVE SAMPLED HIS WORK.
6611
AGAIN LOOK AT HOW SELF ABSORBED YOU'RE BEING!!!
6611
I HAPPEN TO THINK HE HAS A BRILLIANT COMEDIC MIND, FOR A HUMAN.
6611
OH SHUT UP.
6611
I AM NOT HERE TO DEBATE YOU ON THE FINER POINTS OF CINEMA, OR TO "GET MY GIRL BACK."
6611
HOW DESPERATE DO YOU THINK I AM?
6611
I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO DO THE OPPOSITE.
6611
I WANTED TO TELL YOU I'M TOTALLY OK WITH IT.
6611
BUT JUST LISTEN, AND TRY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. I KNOW THAT'S HARD FOR YOU.
6611
HERE, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
6612
IT'S AN ALTERNIAN ROMANCE NOVEL.
6612
NOW LOOK, I'M NOT VOUCHING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LITERATURE. IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY TRASHY AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED I COULD RECOMMEND MUCH BETTER THINGS TO YOU.
6612
IT'S JUST THIS ONE ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT VERY CLEARLY.
6612
IT'S A PRETTY TYPICAL CASE OF QUADRANT VACILLATION AS APPLIED TO AN OVERLAPPING GROUP OF ROMANTIC PAIRINGS.
6612
WILL YOU PIPE DOWN AND JUST HEAR ME OUT.
6612
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. THINK OF IT AS BEING SIMILAR TO ONE OF YOUR PRIMITIVE HUMAN LOVE TRIANGLES.
6612
THOUGH THIS IS A QUADRANGLE. THOSE ARE MUCH MORE COMMON IN OUR SOCIETY AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND FOUR IS PRETTY MUCH THE MINIMUM VALUE FOR LOVE-HATE N-DRANGLES.
6612
NOW HERE IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH THIS GROUP OF CHARACTERS. PAY ATTENTION. HEY, LOOK AT ME. EYES OVER HERE. GOOD.
6612
SEE THE TWO HEROES IN THE MIDDLE, PARTAKING IN THEIR FLUSHED EMBRACE? PRETTY MUCH YOUR TYPICAL LOWBLOOD REDROM PAIRING. THEIR DYNAMIC IS THE GRUBLOAF AND TUBER PASTE OF THE OVERALL ARC.
6612
BUT WHAT HAVE WE HERE? THERE ARE SOME NEFARIOUS HIGHBLOODS IN THE PICTURE TOO. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING.
6612
THE GUY ON THE LEFT IS AN OLD CALIGINOUS FLAME FROM THE MALE LOWBLOOD'S PAST, AND HAS REENTERED THE PICTURE. AGAIN, NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. HE CAN CONTINUE TO COURT HIS MATESPRIT AND KISMESIS WITHOUT CONFLICT. IT'S A PERFECTLY AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT THAT EVERYONE'S TOTALLY DOWN WITH.
6612
NO QUESTIONS YET.
6612
SO THEN THAT'S ALL FINE, PRETTY BOILERPLATE CONDITIONS FOR UNFOLDING ROMDRAMA, BUT THERE'S A TWIST.
6612
THE MALE HIGHBLOOD AND LOWBLOOD START TO HAVE FLUSHED FEELINGS FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS RESULTS IN SOME RED INFIDELITY BETWEEN THE LOWBLOOD PAIR.
6612
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS WHERE THE FIREWORKS START GOING OFF. THE RED FEELINGS BETWEEN THE LOWBLOODS TURN TO BLACK, AND THUS BEGINS WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS QUADRANT VACILLATION.
6612
MEANWHILE THE TWO MALES ARE ALSO VACILLATING BETWEEN RED AND BLACK, BECAUSE YOU DON'T JUST LET GO OF A RIVALRY SO EASILY.
6612
YEAH, WELL, IT GETS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT, PROBABLY MORE THAN NEEDED FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING THE POINT.
6612
IN THE HEAT OF THEIR VACILLATION, DURING AN ESPECIALLY BLACK PHASE, THE LOWBLOOD FEMALE WAXES RED FOR A NOTORIOUS AND ESPECIALLY BRUTAL HIGHBLOOD FEMALE.
6612
SO THEY HAVE THEIR THING ON THE SIDE, BUT EVEN THAT STARTS VACILLATING TOO BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PAIR JUST KEEP SPINNING LIKE A TOP.
6612
WE DON'T NEED TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN THE QUADRANGLE DYNAMIC THOUGH, AND FOR OUR PURPOSES THE 4TH PARTY IS A DISTRACTION.
6612
THE THING IS, VACILLATION ALWAYS ADDS A LOT OF DRAMA TO EVERYTHING, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE VIABLE.
6612
IT CAN TOTALLY WORK, AND EVERYONE CAN BE REASONABLE ABOUT IT, IT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF SENSIBLE SCHEDULING.
6612
DAVE, PLEASE.
6612
JUST READ THE BOOK, OK? IT'S ALL IN THE BOOK.
6613
I THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER. I CAN TRANSLATE FOR YOU. I'LL READ THE WHOLE DAMN THING ALOUD IF YOU WANT.
6613
SERIOUSLY, IT COULD REALLY EXPAND YOUR LIMITED HUMAN THINK PAN ON STUFF.
6613
THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT'S APPLICABLE TO OUR SITUATION.
6613
DON'T BE DENSE. OF COURSE THERE IS.
6613
TEREZI AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE VERGE OF VACILLATING LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME.
6613
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE KILLED THE SUSPENSE AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGED IT.
6613
YOU AND SHE SEEM BENT ON DEVELOPING SOMETHING IN THE FLUSHED QUADRANT, AND LIKE I SAID, I'M FINE WITH THAT.
6613
IF WE CAN JUST GET OUR SHIT STRAIGHTENED OUT, WE CAN BE LIKE THESE VACILLATING PAIRS THAT ALTERNATE BETWEEN RED AND BLACK, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S COMPLEMENTARY WITH EACH OTHER'S PATTERNS.
6613
LIKE WHILE SHE AND I ARE BLACK, YOU AND SHE ARE RED.
6613
BUT THEN WHEN SHE AND I ARE RED, YOU AND SHE... I DON'T KNOW IF HUMANS ARE REALLY CAPABLE OF BLACK FEELINGS?
6613
I GUESS THAT'S UP TO YOU. MAYBE YOU CAN JUST LIKE, SIT THOSE PERIODS OUT.
6613
LIKE TAKE A BREAK, YOU KNOW?
6613
SNAPPED LIKE A FUCKING FOX. THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
6613
LIKE I SAID, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF RESPONSIBLE SCHEDULING.
6613
HERE LET ME SHOW YOU.
6613
I NEED SOME PAPER. WHERE'S SOME PAPER.
6614
LOOK, IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE.
6614
HANG ON WHILE I DRAW THE GUIDELINES.
6614
IT'S NOT A SHIPPING GRID.
6614
JUST SOME ROWS AND COLUMNS FOR A SCHEDULE.
6614
COME ON, LOOK HERE. THESE ARE THE DAYS OF THE WEEK.
6614
THEN WE EACH HAVE ROWS FOR THOSE DAYS AND WE CAN DRAW A HEART OR A SPADE FOR ANY GIVEN DAY.
6614
THAT WAY WE KNOW WHAT'S UP IN ADVANCE, AND AVOID UNPLEASANT CONFLICTS.
6615
HEY, CUT IT OUT. DON'T TOUCH ME.
6615
IT'S NOT A SHIPPING GRID YOU OBTUSE FUCK.
6615
NO.
6615
FUCK YOU. LET ME DRAW.
6615
*IT IS NOT A SHIPPING GRID*
6615
THIS IS NOT SHIPPING YOU HEINOUS TOOL, THIS IS COMMON SENSE.
6616
LET GO.
6616
LOOK, I JUST DREW A SQUARE.
6616
GET READY TO SEE A LOT MORE OF THOSE!
6616
IN MY MIND'S EYE I AM PICTURING A BEAUTIFUL LATTICE OF LINES AND COMPARTMENTS, INTERLOCKING WITH SUBLIME PRECISION AT NINETY DEGREE ANGLES.
6616
I IMAGINE THIS MODULAR RETICULATION AS AN ELEGANT VESSEL, IF YOU WILL, FOR THE GRAND SYNTHESIS OF OUR SHARED SHIPPING DREAMS.
6616
YES
6616
FUCK YES
6616
OOH LOOK, ANOTHER SQUARE, SORT OF.
6616
KIND OF WOBBLY! IT'LL HAVE TO DO.
6616
WAIT, I THINK IT'S COMING.
6616
HERE IT COMES, MY FIRST "SHIP", IT'S GOING IN THE SQUARE!
6616
HELL NO.
6616
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM??
6616
OW, FUCK.
6617
DOING WHAT??
6617
SHE WILL SOON ENOUGH.
6617
NO, I'M DRAWING.
6617
GET LOST.
6617
YOU SMELL BAD.
6617
MY LUSUS BROUGHT THINGS HOME THAT SMELLED MORE APPEALING THAN YOU.
6617
IMPORTANT FACT: 100% OF WHAT HE BROUGHT HOME WAS EITHER A DEAD ANIMAL, OR LITERAL FECES.
6617
HOW CAN SHE STAND YOU WITH HER SENSITIVE NOSE?
6617
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN WASHED THAT RIDICULOUS OUTFIT?
6617
NO, IT'S MINE NOW. I'M KEEPING IT ON PRINCIPLE.
6618
I'M NOT DRAWING THOSE!!!!!!!
6618
YOU'RE MAKING ME DRAW THEM, STOP THAT.
6618
ARGH... STOP!
6618
DON'T
6618
NO FUCK
6618
OK NO
6618
YOU DREW THAT ONE
6618
YOU DREW THAT ONE!!!!
6618
DON'T PRETEND YOU DIDN'T!
6618
FUUUUUUUCK LET GO OF ME!
6618
NO
6618
NO
6618
FINE TAKE IT!
6618
WHAT??
6618
LET GO
6618
I'M TRYING TO LET GO OF THE STUPID PEN BUT YOU WON'T LET ME
6618
YOU CRAZY FUCK
6618
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!
6619
THIS ALTERCATION IS BECOMING UNCOMFORTABLY PHYSICAL, GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.
6619
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
6619
YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALL THIS HOSTILE TOUCHING AND GRABBING DO YOU???
6619
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOU STRIDER, JUST STEP OFF.
6620
WHY DON'T YOU OLD FASHIONED GO FUCK YOURSELF?
6620
FUFCK NYOUF.
6621
RAAARARRAAUUUAAAAUUAGHGHGGHGGGGHHGH!
6623

6658
YEAH, I THINK IT IS.
6658
OH SHIT
6658
JOHN WATCH OUT!!!!!!
6658
WELL, FUCK.
6658
LOOKS LIKE HE'S STILL AN IDIOT.
6886
WOW. HEY.
6886
FUCKING *EXCUSE ME*
6887
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE AND WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT YOU.
6887
THEY AREN'T OUR ANCESTORS. WE DON'T HAVE ANCESTORS.
6887
ANCESTRAL LEGACIES ARE A LOT OF SUPERSTITIOUS, ARISTOCRATIC BULLSHITTERY, INVENTED BY HIGHBLOODS SO THEY GET TO FEEL EVEN MORE SMUG AND SELF SATISFIED THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.
6887
EVEN IF WE DO HAVE THEM, WHO CARES? WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THESE PEOPLE?
6887
LISTEN. I DON'T KNOW THEM.
6887
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME PASSING THROUGH DREAM BUBBLES IF I'M NOT GOING TO SEE MY DEAD FRIENDS.
6887
IF YOU DRAGGED ME ALL THE WAY UP HERE TO MEET, OH SAY, GHOST NEPETA. FUCKING GREAT!
6887
I'LL HANG OUT WITH DEAD NEPETA ALL DAY LONG. HELL, EVEN SOME RANDOM NEPETA FROM A DOOMED TIMELINE. THAT WOULD BE ALRIGHT.
6887
YOU KNOW WHAT? GIVE ME FIFTY FUCKING NEPETAS! WHY THE HELL NOT. WE'LL CALL OUR JOURNEY THROUGH BLACK ENDLESS DESPAIR "NEPETAQUEST".
6887
BUT THESE LOSERS? WHO CARES ABOUT THEM. I DON'T NEED TO BE MAKING ANY NEW FRIENDS. I HAVE ENOUGH "NEW FRIENDS" AS IT IS.
6887
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY, RANDOM HUMAN!
6887
I'M LEAVING.
6887
THANKS, WHOEVER THE FUCK!!!
6887
BYE.
6887
NO.
7827
DAVE ARE YOU THERE
7828
COME IN DAVE.
7829
THIS IS KARKAT.
7829
OVER.
7830
ANSWER ME YOU JACKOFF.
7830
DON'T BE ALL LIKE YOU'RE TOO BUSY TO PICK UP, WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID.
7830
YOU ARE QUITE POSSIBLY THE ONLY PERSON ON THIS METEOR WHO'S GOT EVEN LESS ON HIS NUTRITION PLATEAU THAN ME.
7830
EVEN THE MAYOR HAS A MORE DEMANDING SCHEDULE THAN WE DO, LET'S FACE THE FUCKING FACTS.
7830
WHAT. DID YOU THINK CAN TOWN RUNS ITSELF??
7830
FAT CHANCE.
7830
DAVE.
7830
GOD DAMN IT DAVE.
7830
I HAVE A PROBLEM.
7830
NO.
7830
*WE* HAVE A PROBLEM.
7831
SKAIA IS NOW VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.
7831
WE CAN'T BE MUCH MORE THAN A FEW HOURS AWAY.
7831
THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
7831
THREE OF THE LONGEST HUMAN "YEARS" WE'LL EVER HAVE TO LIVE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
7831
SUNK INTO THIS DEPRESSING LABORATORY WHICH BY ALL ACCOUNTS SHOULD NEVER HAVE FUNCTIONED AS ANYTHING BUT OUR ETERNAL TOMB.
7831
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE'RE EVEN SUPPOSED TO STOP THIS THING. DO YOU?
7831
OH WELL, SENDING IT BLASTING OFF SOMEWHERE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SURE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME!
7831
AND NOW THAT WE'RE FINALLY HERE, AFTER ALL THE WAITING AND DRAMA AND BOREDOM AND STUPID BULLSHIT WITH OUR ANCESTRAL GHOSTS
7831
AND EVEN DISREGARDING THE ONE HILARIOUSLY NEGLECTED DETAIL THAT THIS METEOR HAS NO FUCKING BRAKES
7831
I STILL DON'T THINK WE'RE READY FOR THIS.
7832
*SIGH*
7833
I DON'T
7833
...
7833
HOW DO I EVEN BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS SHIT.
7833
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS.
7833
SINCE I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER GENERAL PURPOSE QUESTION TO HELP BREAK THE ICE IN LITERALLY ANY IMAGINABLE SOCIAL SITUATION.
7834
WHERE ARE YOUR FUCKING PANTS?
7835
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.
7835
DAVE, WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM HERE.
7835
I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A...
7835
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?
7835
AN INTERVENTION?
7835
NO, NOT ROSE.
7835
WHY WOULD I BE TALKING ABOUT ROSE?
7835
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED ABOUT BY HER FRIENDS BEFORE SHE FLUSHES HER WHOLE LIFE DOWN THE GAPER, DOES SHE??
7835
WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIKES TO DRINK THAT GOOFY HUMAN SOPORIFIC THAT MAKES HER A LOT FUNNIER AND MORE CHARMING THAN USUAL?
7835
HOW IS THAT A PROBLEM?
7835
I WAS TALKING ABOUT TEREZI.
7835
HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE HOW THAT IS A *HUGE* FUCKING PROBLEM.
7835
OK, CAN WE JUST ONCE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE MUTUAL ALIENS TO EACH OTHER AND AS SUCH POSSIBLY HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES AND STANDARDS ABOUT THINGS???
7835
JUST THIS ONE TIME DAVE? THANKS!
7835
SHE NEEDS TO WAKE UP SO WE CAN TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS.
7835
SHE WON'T WAKE UP, WHAT DO I DO.
7835
YES.
7836
WELL, WHENEVER SHE WAKES UP, WE ALL NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK ABOUT THIS.
7836
IF SHE'S IN THIS CONDITION WHEN WE GET TO THE NEW SESSION, IT'LL BE A GODDAMN EMBARRASSMENT.
7836
NOT TO MENTION DEADLY! NEED I REMIND YOU WHO'S STILL FOLLOWING US? SHE DOESN'T LOOK PRIMED FOR BATTLE FROM WHERE I'M STANDING!
7836
WE NEED TO ACT AS A UNIFIED FRONT, DAVE. WE NEED TO LET HER KNOW THAT AS HER FRIENDS WE CAN'T STAND BY AND WATCH HER DEGRADE HERSELF LIKE THIS.
7836
STAND BY. I'M PUTTING YOU ON SPEAKER CRAB.
7836
YES. SPEAKER CRAB.
7836
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU DAVE. SHE TRUSTS YOU.
7836
MAYBE IT IS DAVE!
7836
MAYBE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT FUCKING IS.
7836
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT A "GOD TIER".
7836
I AM NOT SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE BLESSED WITH THE "GIFT OF GAB" LIKE YOU.
7836
THAT BADGE YOU EARNED. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO TALK TO PEOPLE?
7836
LIKE, REALLY OPEN UP ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS AND SAY WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE SAID?
7836
ISN'T IT??
7836
OK WHAT DOES IT DO THEN WISE GUY!
7836
YOU SNIDE CHUTE HUFFER.
7836
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE SO I CAN PUSH YOU OFF THIS BUILDING?
7836
I'M PUTTING YOU ON SPEAKER CRAB, AND THEN TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT *REAL AS SHIT*, DO YOU HEAR ME?
7837
YES! I WANT HER TO DO THAT!
7837
THE LATTER THING.
7837
DAVE
7837
YOUR WISDOM, MY GOD
7837
IT'S KNOCKING MY SOCKS OFF. HOLY SHIT, PLEASE TELL ME THE SECRET TO YOUR WISE WAYS.
7837
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
7837
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.
7837
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
7837
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT.
7837
JUST WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING SO "COLORFULLY"?
7837
I GUESS I DO THE SAME THING, BUT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO TAKE THINGS TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF GROSS. JUST PLEASE SAY SHIT NORMALLY FOR A CHANGE, OK.
7837
REGARDING GAMZEE, YEAH. I KNEW ABOUT THAT ALREADY.
7837
MOTHERFUCKER, PLEASE.
7837
DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT? I'VE SUSPECTED THIS WAS GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME.
7837
I WAS JUST BEING LIKE YOU, PLAYING IT COOL, LETTING HER DO WHATEVER.
7837
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST STRAW! WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE READY FOR ACTION BY NOW.
7837
NOT COMATOSE, HALF NAKED AND FAYGO STICKY.
7837
GOD, I WONDER WHAT SORT OF BULLSHIT HE'S GOT HER BELIEVING IN NOW? ABOUT THE MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS AND SHANGRI LA AND ALL THAT GARBAGE.
7837
IT MAKES ME SO SAD TO THINK SHE'S CAUGHT UP IN HIS SUPERSTITIOUS WEB OF LIES.
7837
IT'S BEEN AWFUL WATCHING THE PERSON I USED TO KNOW SLOWLY DRIFT AWAY FROM ME, TO THE POINT WHERE SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE GONE.
7837
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DEAL WITH THAT?
7837
YOU AND SHE USED TO SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME. WHAT HAPPENED?
7837
WE HAVE A HYPER GRAVITY CHAMBER???
7837
OH
7837
YEAH. UH.
7837
GAMZEE ENDED OUR MOIRALLEGIANCE QUITE SOME TIME AGO.
7837
IT'S FINE. IT WAS REALLY A DEAD END PALE RELATIONSHIP.
7837
AT FIRST IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE I WAS A NECESSARY PART OF HIS LIFE, KEEPING HIS SHIT UNDER CONTROL...
7837
BUT AS TIME WENT ON HE JUST GOT COMPLETELY DISINTERESTED AND WASN'T KEEPING UP WITH HIS END OF THE THING AT ALL.
7837
HE STARTED GETTING SO UNBELIEVABLY SELF SATISFIED AND PIOUS, LIKE WAY MORE THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.
7837
LIKE HE'S JUST SO COMPLETELY CONVINCED HE'S FOUND HIS CALLING, THAT THIS SESSION IS THE GATEWAY TO THE PROMISED LAND WHERE HE'LL FULFILL HIS DESTINY.
7837
HE'S SO CAUGHT UP IN HIS IDIOTIC SCHEMES HE COULDN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ME ANYMORE.
7837
WHATEVER. AT LEAST HE STOPPED KILLING PEOPLE.
7837
OH GOD!
7837
THAT FUCKING GOD TIER OUTFIT.
7837
WHAT A GODDAMN FAKER. I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME IMAGINE WHERE HE GOT THAT THING.
7837
I KNOW KANAYA SURE AS HELL DIDN'T MAKE IT FOR HIM.
7837
THE MAN LITERALLY HAS NO SHAME.
7837
I DON'T KNOW!
7837
I DON'T THINK EVEN HE KNOWS.
7837
MAYBE TO MAKE A "GOOD IMPRESSION" ON HIS FAKE ASS RELIGIOUS IDOL, AFTER HE THRUSTS HIS SACRED COD PIECE THROUGH THE GATES OF SHANGRI LA.
7837
YEAH!!!
7837
HAHAHA! IT'S SO TRUE.
7837
I WISH I COULD SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WHEN HE FINALLY REALIZES EVERYTHING HE BELIEVES IS A LIE.
7837
HEY DAVE.
7837
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO US AFTER WE MEET UP WITH THE OTHERS.
7837
I MEAN, AS FRIENDS.
7837
I MEAN WILL WE STILL GET TO BE BROS.
7837
NO BUT SEE
7837
WE'RE GOING TO MEET ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE.
7837
JOHN AMONG THEM.
7837
AND JOHN IS YOUR BEST FRIEND, SO YOU WILL OSTENSIBLY RESUME THAT FRIENDSHIP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.
7837
AND JOHN AND I HAD A FEW TESTY CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER ONE DAY, AND IN MOST OF THOSE I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF.
7837
AND I GUESS WE BECAME FRIENDS THAT DAY? MAYBE??
7837
BUT THE REALITY IS IT WAS JUST ONE DAY, AND HE'D BE WELL WITHIN A REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND NOT TO GIVE A CRAP IN HINDSIGHT ABOUT THE GUY WHO TROLLED HIM ONCE THREE YEARS AGO.
7837
AND THE SAME GOES FOR JADE!
7837
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DECENT RAPPORT, BUT AGAIN, IT WAS ONE DAY FOREVER AGO. SHE PROBABLY BARELY REMEMBERS ME AT THIS POINT.
7837
WHEREAS THAT DOESN'T MATTER FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU GO WAY BACK WITH THEM. THIS IS LIKE A FUCKING *HEARTFELT REUNION* FOR YOU GUYS.
7837
BUT WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME??
7837
I CAN HARDLY CALL GAMZEE A FRIEND ANYMORE. WHO KNOWS IF MY FRIENDSHIP WITH TEREZI WILL EVER BE WHAT IT WAS BEFORE. I USED TO BE PRETTY CLOSE WITH KANAYA, BUT NOW SHE AND ROSE NEVER LEAVE EACH OTHER ALONE FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING MINUTE.
7837
ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS ARE DEAD, AND NOW WE'RE LEAVING THE DREAM BUBBLES BEHIND.
7837
AND THEN THERE'S YOU.
7837
SO
7837
I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
7837
THE MAYOR'S FRIENDSHIP IS A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT, AND I AM INSULTED BEYOND COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS MY CAPACITY TO VOMIT THAT YOU WOULD INSINUATE OTHERWISE.
7837
UH OH, LOOK WHO'S STARTING TO COME AROUND!
7838
WAKE UP SLEEPY HEAD!
7838
HONK HONK HONK, YEAH THAT'S RIGHT! IT'S TIME TO FACE THE FUCKING MUSIC.
7917
WHO???
7917
OH YEAH.
7917
HER.
7917
I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T KEEP ALL THESE GHOST NAMES STRAIGHT.
7917
FLIPTUNA? MEOWLIN...
7917
WASN'T THERE A CARLOS?
7917
FUCK IT. THEY WERE ALL NAMED CARLOS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
7917
WAIT. EXCEPT MEENAH. SHE WAS ALRIGHT. A LITTLE FORWARD, BUT...
7917
WHATEVER, THIS ISN'T THE POINT.
7917
ALL I REMEMBER ABOUT MY INTERACTIONS WITH THE SERKET GIRL WAS GETTING CORNERED INTO THESE LUDICROUS MONOLOGUES, THEN RACKING MY BRAIN FOR EXCUSES TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.
7917
SO SHE WAS JUST LIKE
7917
*POOF!*
7917
AND SUDDENLY YOUR EYES WERE BETTER?
7917
WHAT IS SHE, SOME SORT OF MAGIC FAIRY??
7917
OH
7917
ALRIGHT, I GUESS HER STORY CHECKS OUT THEN.
7917
GOOD FOR HER.
7917
BUT THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU TEREZI. I MEAN, I DIDN'T THINK YOU EVEN WANTED YOUR EYESIGHT BACK?
7917
I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE AS CHUFFED ABOUT HER OWN DISABILITY AS YOU. I WAS ALWAYS UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU FELT LIKE IT WAS A BIG PART OF WHO YOU ARE?
7917
WHOA WHOA
7917
THE *ONLY* COOL THING ABOUT YOU?
7917
TEREZI. I WANT TO BE UNDERSTANDING, BUT I CAN'T GET BEHIND SOME OF THE SHIT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT YOURSELF HERE.
7917
WHAT MADE YOU START UNRAVELING LIKE THIS?
7917
WAIT. WE MET ALL THOSE PEOPLE LIKE...
7917
KIND OF A LONG TIME AGO?
7917
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING THIS FROM EVERYONE?
7917
YEAH! THAT'S WHAT HIDING IT MEANS.
7917
I KNOW, BUT NOT TELLING ANYBODY THAT IS STILL BEING POINTLESSLY SECRETIVE!
7917
YOU COULD HAVE SAID, HEY KARKAT, I FUCKED UP AND NOW I CAN SEE AGAIN. MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS SO I DON'T GO INTO A TRAGIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND MAKE YOU WORRY ABOUT ME FOR NO REASON!
7917
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS CLANDESTINE BLACKROM NONSENSE YOU'VE GOT GOING ON WITH GAMZEE?
7917
HAVE YOU BEEN DATING HIM FOR JUST AS LONG?
7917
WAS HE INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION??
7917
LIKE, DID HE HELP TALK YOU INTO HEALING YOUR EYES OR SOMETHING?!
7917
OH MY GOD. TEREZI, YOU ARE A FUCKING CATASTROPHE.
7917
YOU USED TO BE LIKE, CUNNING? AND CONSIDERABLY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ME, WHICH I HAVE NO PROBLEM ADMITTING.
7917
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. EVEN IF I DIDN'T FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF, WHICH I *DID* BECAUSE IT WAS *OBVIOUS*, YOU ARE UP HERE ON THE ROOF LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN A PILE OF HONK HORNS AND FAYGO BOTTLES.
7917
I AM NOT A MASTER OF DEDUCTION, BUT UNLESS YOU WERE RECENTLY STOMPED ON BY SOME SORT OF GOLEM COMPOSED OF GARBAGE FROM A CIRCUS, IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY YOU ARE OFFICIALLY DOWN WITH THE CLOWN.
7917
WELL? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT.
7917
THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING IT!
7918
TEREZI...
7918
THIS IS KILLING ME, HEARING THIS.
7918
I SERIOUSLY WANT TO WEEP ACTUAL PUKE OUT OF MY EYEBALLS FROM THIS STORY.
7918
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN???
7918
I'VE GOT TO SAY, I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING. IF YOU TOLD ME SWEEPS AGO YOU AND HE...
7918
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. LIKE IF THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL THERE, I SURE AS FUCK DIDN'T READ IT.
7918
I KNEW IT!
7918
I KNEW HE MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT DECISION. THAT SLIMY BASTARD.
7918
THIS IS MOSTLY MY FAULT. I WASN'T VIGILANT ENOUGH WITH HIM, AND I LET OUR MOIRALLEGIANCE BREAK DOWN.
7918
IF I KEPT A CLOSER EYE ON HIM, MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE LURED YOU INTO HIS SPINNING TENT OF SHIT.
7918
OR MAYBE IT'S KANAYA'S FAULT? SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A REALLY GOOD AUSPISTICE. MAYBE SHE COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS, IF SHE WASN'T SO PREOCCUPIED HERSELF.
7918
NO WAIT! IT'S ACTUALLY MY FAULT AGAIN! IF I HAD BEEN ON THE BALL AND AUSPISTICIZED BETWEEN HER AND ROSE, SHE WOULD HAVE HAD THE TIME TO AUSPISTICIZE BETWEEN YOU AND GAMZEE!
7918
DAMMIT, I ALWAYS SAY I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ROMANCE, YET I ROUTINELY UNDERESTIMATE ITS COMPLEXITY, SO I ONLY FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AFTER IT'S WAY TOO LATE!
7918
GOD I'M SO STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID
7918
YEAH OK.
7918
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, HE'LL PROBABLY JUST BREAK IT OFF AND LEAVE YOU ONCE WE GET TO THE NEW SESSION.
7918
ALL HIS LOYALTIES AND PRIORITIES ARE TOTALLY WARPED NOW. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT ANYMORE, BUT IT SURE ISN'T ANY OF US.
7918
YEAH. I DO.
7918
WHOA, WHAT??
7918
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
7918
OK, HELP ME OUT!
7918
YOU'RE CONFUSING ME HERE.
7918
WOW.
7918
ALRIGHT, I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE. SORRY.
7918
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE HERE.
7918
BUT I'M NOT ALWAYS SURE WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO SAY IS!
7918
I'M DOING MY FUCKING BEST. THIS IS COMPLICATED FOR ME TOO, YOU'RE BOTH MY FRIENDS.
7918
WHAT?
7918
WHY??
7918
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH MY CHAIR.
7918
NO, LOOK. IT'S CASUAL AND RELAXED.
7918
LIKE, IT VISUALLY CONVEYS THAT MY PRESENCE IN THE CONVERSATION IS HUMBLE AND NONTHREATENING, YET FRANK AND ATTENTIVE.
7918
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
7918
WHY SHOULD I SQUAT ON THE DIRTY FLOOR, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!
7918
OK, WOW, FINE!
7918
FUCK THE CHAIR. PARDON ME FOR MAKING MYSELF COMFORTABLE DURING A SINCERE HEART TO HEART DISCUSSION WITH A DEAR FRIEND IN NEED!
7918
BUT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO CEASE STRADDLING THIS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE PIECE OF FURNITURE! AWAY WITH YE, FOUR LEGGED TEMPTRESS! DISTRACT US NO MORE WITH THE MOST BASIC AND UTILITARIAN FORM OF CREATURE COMFORT YOU SUPPLY!!!
7919
AT LAST!
7919
WE ARE FREE FROM THE ACCURSED INSTRUMENT OF ASS ELEVATION!
7919
UNLIKE EVERYONE ELSE EVER, I HAPPEN TO MAKE A PRACTICE OF CAPTCHALOGUING ITEMS WHICH MIGHT BE CONVENIENT ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS.
7919
SAY I'M STROLLING AROUND AND FIND MYSELF IN NEED OF A PLACE TO SIT? BAM. SUDDENLY, A CHAIR.
7919
AND NO I DIDN'T STEAL IT.
7919
HOW COULD I STEAL SOMETHING FROM THE COMMON AREA? NOBODY ACTUALLY OWNS ANY OF THAT FUCKING FURNITURE.
7919
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED THE *COMMON* AREA, YOU ACCUSATORY PIECE OF FILTH.
7919
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??
7919
YOU APPEAR TO BE JUMPSTARTING A FACETIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME SORT OF HUMAN ECONOMIC IDEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK, WITHOUT HAVING THE SLIGHTEST CLUE THAT YOUR VEHICLE IS PARKED SQUARELY IN THE NOBODY GIVES A FUCK ZONE.
7919
WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
7919
YOU AREN'T BEING SERIOUS NOW!
7919
THESE ARE NOT THE WORDS OF A SERIOUS PERSON.
7919
I WAS HAVING A *SERIOUS DISCUSSION* LIKE A *BIG TIME ADULT* WITH MY GOOD FRIEND TEREZI.
7919
YOUR CALLOUS AND NONSENSICAL REMARKS ARE DERAILING US FROM THE DELICATE SUBJECT AT HAND.
7919
WHY DON'T YOU BE USEFUL AND SAY SOMETHING REASSURING TO OUR SAD MUTUAL BUDDY, YOU WAILING JET ENGINE OF INFANTILE STULTILOQUENCE??????
7919
AUGH.
7919
TEREZI, DO YOU SEE? DO YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH??
7919
ACTUALLY, I GUESS YOU CAN! YOU CAN NOW LITERALLY SEE WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH, AND EXPERIENCE ALL DUE EMPATHY FOR THE FACT THAT I HAVE A DOUCHE AS A BEST FRIEND!
7919
SO THAT'S IT THEN
7919
NO ADVICE AT ALL, SMARTALEC?
7919
WHY DID I EVEN BRING YOU HERE FOR THIS INTERMISSION THEN.
7919
INTERVENTION I MEAN. SORRY, I MISSPOKE.
7919
OK???
7919
WHAT. JUST LIKE THAT?!
7920
I THINK WE ARE MISSING THE POINT HERE.
7920
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT AN UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A FOUL SOFT DRINK.
7920
IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF.
7920
YOU ARE BARELY FUNCTIONAL RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK YOURSELF UP OFF THE FLOOR AND PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS.
7920
REMEMBER PANTS TEREZI?? YOU USED TO LOVE PANTS!
7920
YOU USED TO...
7920
YOU USED TO BE A LOT OF THINGS. AND ALL OF THOSE WERE GOOD THINGS.
7920
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO ARRIVE, RIGHT WHEN WE NEED YOU THE MOST, YOU DO A SENSATIONAL BELLYFLOP INTO A CIRCUS VAT OF YOUR OWN TANGY SLOBBER.
7920
YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THIS PARTY!
7920
WE'LL NEED YOU TO HELP STAND UP TO JACK, AND WHATEVER ELSE IS WAITING FOR US THERE.
7920
WELL, NOT LIKE THIS YOU WON'T. YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.
7920
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MIND POWERS THOUGH!
7920
WHAT IF WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH MIND POWERS? TO DO SOME SORT OF...
7920
MINDY THING.
7920
YOU KNOW. THE ONES WHERE YOU...
7920
FLIP A COIN. AND...
7920
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS.
7920
OK, I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HOW IT WORKS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT?
7920
HUH?
7920
OH.
7920
RIGHT.
7920
WELL, YEAH. OF COURSE IT WAS NECESSARY.
7920
EVEN IF IT WASN'T THE MORALLY RIGHT CHOICE OR WHATEVER, IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT HAD TO HAPPEN.
7920
THAT'S THE CRUEL THING ABOUT PARADOX SPACE. IT SYSTEMICALLY VALIDATES ALL YOUR MISTAKES AS NECESSARY OUTCOMES.
7920
NOT EVEN NECESSARY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD OR PERSONAL GROWTH. IT'S ALWAYS BIGGER THAN YOU. LIKE YOUR ERRORS IN JUDGMENT ARE INSEPARABLE FROM THE WAY REALITY HAS TO UNFOLD.
7920
SO IT NEVER LETS YOU FORGET ABOUT THEM. BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL CRITICAL TO THE BIG PICTURE, AND ALL YOUR PAST FLAWS ARE LIKE...
7920
SCARS.
7920
SCARS IN SPACETIME THAT NEVER HEAL, AND ALWAYS SERVE TO REMIND YOU THAT THE PERFECT VERSION OF YOURSELF YOU WISH YOU COULD BE CAN NEVER EXIST. BECAUSE THE SURVIVAL OF EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT DEPENDS ON HIM NOT EXISTING.
7920
IT'S SIMPLE. IF YOU HADN'T KILLED HER, YOU WOULD HAVE WITHERED AWAY IN A DOOMED TIMELINE.
7920
WELL, *I* WOULDN'T WANT THAT!
7920
DOES THAT FUCKING MATTER TO YOU?
7920
DOES THAT FACTOR ANYWHERE INTO YOUR DREARY EXISTENTIAL EQUATION???
7920
NO
7920
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CRAZY FOR THAT.
8124
NO, WE HAVEN'T.
8124
OH MY GOD.
8124
WE'RE STILL TRAVELING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, AND WE ONLY SEEM TO BE PICKING UP STEAM!
8124
WHAT?
8124
NO.
8124
*I'M* JUST SAYING.
8124
WE CAME ALL THIS WAY, AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!
8125
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
8125
HOW COULD WE NOT HAVE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH BETTER!
8125
IT'S LIKE THE RECKONING V 2.0. OR 3.0. OR WAIT, MAYBE 4.0 IF WE'RE COUNTING THE BEFORUS SESS... UGH, FUCK THIS SENTENCE I'M SAYING.
8125
HOW COULD IT ALL BOIL DOWN TO *YET ANOTHER* METEOR HURTLING TOWARD SKAIA SERVING AS THE HARBINGER OF OUR IMMINENT DEMISE?
8125
EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'RE *RIDING* THE FUCKING HARBINGER.
8125
WHICH IS IRONIC WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT! WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS LIFE RIDING A METEOR. MAKES SENSE THAT'S HOW WE'LL ALL GO OUT! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
8125
WHERE! I NEVER SAW ANY!
8125
MAYBE THEY WERE BEING STORED IN THE HYPER GRAVITY CHAMBER!
8125
WHY YOU ABHORRENT COLUMN OF SMARMY FILTH. YOU ALWAYS DID KNOW HOW TO RUB SALT IN THE WOUND.
8125
WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO CAN'T FLY! YOU *KNOW* I CAN'T FLY, AND YOU *KNOW* IT'S A SORE SUBJECT FOR ME!
8125
I'D RATHER FUCKING DIE!!!!!!
8126
WHAT? NO I DIDN'T BARK.
8126
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.
8126
WELL WHY THE FUCK WOULD I BARK???
8126
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A MENTAL GO FUCK YOURSELF?
8126
OR! OR WAIT! THEN USE YOUR ALLEGED "TIME POWERS" TO MAKE A COPY OF YOURSELF AND TURN THIS AUDACIOUS PHANTASY INTO A SENSUAL REALITY!
8126
THERE IT WAS AGAIN!
8126
THE BARK HAPPENED AGAIN!
8126
WHO THE FUCK IS BARKING.
8126
TEREZI, WAS IT YOU???
8126
WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
8180
WHAT.
8180
GOT WHERE?
8180
WHAT'S LOHAC??
8180
...
8180
IF YOU SAY SO!
8180
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.
8180
LIKE TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW I GOT HERE.
8180
I'M ON THE PLANET WITH THE VOLCANO.
8180
THAT WAS JADE'S PLANET, RIGHT?
8180
I DON'T KNOW!
8180
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ACRONYMS FOR YOUR PLANETS ARE.
8180
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE I LAST SAW THEM, AND EVEN THEN I WAS *BARELY* PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY WERE CALLED BECAUSE I WAS BUSY TROLLING YOU.
8180
ARE YOU SURE? I DON'T SEE ANY FROST!
8180
WHAT ABOUT THE FROGS? DID THEY MELT TOO??
8180
MOTHERFUCKER, DID YOU JUST ASK ME IF I CAN HEAR ANY RIBBITS?
8180
THIS ISN'T JOKE-AROUND PALTIME, DAVE! WE ALL SEEM TO BE SUFFERING FROM SOME FORM OF AMNESIA.
8180
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT?
8180
HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M HERE WITH KANAYA?
8180
OH
8180
ARE YOU WITH ANYONE ON LOHAM?
8180
WHATEVER.
8180
YOU'RE WITH THE MAYOR?
8180
AND NOBODY ELSE??
8180
WHY ARE YOU WITH THE MAYOR?
8180
YOU LUCKY SON OF A BITCH.
8180
I REMEMBER...
8180
JADE.
8180
YEAH.
8180
THAT WAS PRETTY FREAKY.
8180
OH YEAH!
8180
AND JOHN WAS THERE.
8180
I DON'T KNOW.
8225
WHAT'S THAT.
8225
YES. THAT.
8226
THAT'S EARTH??
8226
WHY IS IT SO SMALL
8226
OK BUT
8226
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?
8226
I THOUGHT JACK DESTROYED YOUR UNIVERSE.
8226
THANKS JADE. NO REALLY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE CLARIFICATIONS, WHILE OBLITERATING ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT YOU ARE FIRMLY OFF YOUR ROCKER.
8226
BUT MAYBE IF IT'S NOT *TOO* MUCH EXTRA TROUBLE, YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'VE STRANDED US ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PLANETS, ONLY TO COME TAUNT ME WITH A WATERLOGGED, MINIATURIZED VERSION OF EARTH???
8227
BRRRRRR!
8227
DID YOU FEEL THAT TOO KANAYA? A CHILL JUST RAN DOWN MY TORSO PILLAR DUE TO ALL THE *PURE EVIL* THAT BRAINWASHED JADE IS SAYING! I'M FUCKING PETRIFIED, SOMEBODY HELP ME CHANGE MY SMELLY PANTS!
8227
LISTEN JADE. AND OTHER RANDOM EVIL GIRL, YOU LISTEN TOO. I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR STUPID LITTLE GLOBE OR YOUR OMINOUS ALLUSIONS TO NEW EMPIRES OR WHAT SORT OF PARIAHS WE CAN EXPECT TO BE IN YOUR BOGUS DREAM DYSTOPIA.
8227
THERE IS ONLY ONE COURSE OF ACTION FROM YOU WHICH I WILL TOLERATE, AND THAT IS FEEDING ME A STEADY DIET OF FUCKING ANSWERS! NOT CAGEY, SMIRK-TORTURED INFO-MORSELS DELIVERED BETWEEN SHITTY VILLAIN CHUCKLES, I WANT AN UNINTERRUPTED SPATE OF HARD, UNEMBELLISHED DATA WHICH HAS ONLY ONE PURPOSE, AND THAT IS TO GET ME PERSONALLY UP TO SPEED ON LITERALLY EVERYTHING, RIGHT THIS BLOOD SHITTING SECOND!!!!!
8227
HAHA! YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT PASSWORDS?
8227
COMPARED TO THIS, THE PASSWORDS WERE A GODDAMN LAWNMEAL!!! WITH A CHECKERED TABLECLOTH AND EVERYTHING! FUN FOR ALL INVOLVED, ESPECIALLY THE MARCHBUGS SNEAKING THE CRUMBS AWAY!

I WOULD FUCKING KILL TO HAVE TO GIVE YOU PASSWORDS AGAIN, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANT UNLOCKING REGULAR JADE FROM HER CORRUPTED EMPIRE SERVING BARKFIEND STATE!
8227
*IS* THERE A PASSWORD LIKE THAT JADE? CAN I START GUESSING AT IT??
8227
LET'S SEE, SINCE YOU APPEAR TO BE SOME SORT OF WILD CARNIVOROUS FURRY NOW, IT PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MEAT, DOESN'T IT?
8227
SAUSAGES?
8227
IT'S SAUSAGES ISN'T IT
8227
AM I CLOSE? SOMETHING IN THE SAUSAGE DEPARTMENT.
8227
SNOUT SAUSAGES?
8227
GRUBWURST!
8227
HOOF LOAF??
8227
HAMSTEAK!!!
8227
(ROLLING MY DAMN EYES)
8227
THIS STORY SUCKS SO FAR!
8227
YEAH! THE EMPRESS IS HERE! I THINK WE ALREADY MANAGED TO DEDUCE THAT!
8227
(KANAYA, DO YOU SEE WHAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH)
8227
(YOU DID?)
8227
(OH YEAH)
8227
(I GUESS I FORGOT ABOUT THAT)
8227
I THINK SO!
8227
SHE WANTS US ALL TO GET A NICE HEAD START ON OUR DECADENT NEW LIFE OF SLAVERY PROMISED FOR US ON YOUR SCALE MODEL OF ALTERNIEARTH.
8227
THAT SOUNDS SUPER! DOESN'T THAT SOUND SUPER KANAYA?
8227
I THINK I SPEAK FOR KANAYA WHEN I SAY IT SOUNDS Really Fucking Super.
8227
HOW DO WE GET STARTED??? I AM JUST BEFOULING MY ALREADY-PUNGENT DRAWERS OVER THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND START DOING SLAVERY!
8227
SO YOU WANT US TO MAKE ANOTHER FROG?
8227
UH
8227
WHERE IS IT?
8227
OH YEAH?
8227
IF IT'S THAT SIMPLE, THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO IT!
8227
YOU CAN USE YOUR DOG TELEPORTATION OR WHATEVER.
8227
HAHAHA!
8227
WHY NOT?
8227
COULD IT BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A CRAPPY EVIL VERSION OF YOURSELF, AND THE MIGHTY ECHIDNA JUST POSSIBLY HAS TOO MUCH SELF RESPECT TO BOTHER DIGNIFYING THE FARCE YOU'VE BECOME?
8227
ME???
8227
WHY WOULD SHE ASK TO SEE ME
8227
ANOTHER SPACE PLAYER I COULD UNDERSTAND, BUT WHAT THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?
8227

AS THE BELEAGUERED AND LONG SUFFERING LEADER, ALBEIT *STILL* LEADER OF OUR PARTY, I MOTION THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING SHE SAYS, OR ANYTHING TO HELP THE EMPRESS EVEN IF IT OVERLAPS WITH OUR OWN INTERESTS, AND STOP LISTENING TO WERE-HARLEY UNTIL SHE SNAPS OUT OF HER BRUTAL IDIOT COMA!
8227
THE MOTION PASSES WITH AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF VOTES AMONG PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY WHO AREN'T HORRIBLE!
8228
GROAN
8228
SORRY JADE, BUT YOU SOUND ABOUT AS THREATENING AS SOME MILD FLATULENCE I ONCE HAD
