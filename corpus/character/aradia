3985
did y0u set up the teams
3985
yes
3985
i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that
3985
i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that either
3985
n0t really
3985
im 0k with it
3985
im 0k with a l0t 0f things
3985
even 0ur inevitable failure
3985
th0ugh it will briefly masquerade as vict0ry
3985
she was right ab0ut a l0t 0f things
3985
but y0u like t0 talk t0 me
3985
this a fact n0t a questi0n
3985
they t0ld me
3985
why d0 y0u like t0 talk t0 me
3985

0_0
3985
s0llux i actually w0uld like it if you were happy
3985
y0u seem sad and angry all the time
3985
what d0es anger feel like
3985
i f0rg0t
3985
maybe i never was
3985
i feel like i was th0ugh
3985
0nce
3985
i think his anger serves a greater purp0se
3985
its part 0f his destiny and thus 0urs
3985
it will help him t0 sab0tage his 0wn designs
3985
which are very much in 0pp0siti0n t0 the br0ader purp0se
3985
and will s0w the seeds 0f 0ur failure
3985
a failure which will ir0nically pr0ve t0 be missi0n critical
3985
they never lied th0ugh
3985
this is h0w it had t0 be
3985
i have t0 be t0tally h0nest
3985
th0ugh at n0 p0int did i ever lie
3985
but thr0ugh 0missi0n
3985
this game will n0t save the w0rld
3985
and th0ugh it is still very imp0rtant even in 0ur defeat
3985
unf0rtantely it is much cl0ser t0 serving as the instrument 0f 0ur pe0ples demise than that 0f their salvati0n
3985
and we twelve will behave simultane0usly as the pawns and the 0rchestrat0rs of the great und0ing
3985
y0u will th0ugh
3985
it cann0t be st0pped
3985
mete0rs are en r0ute
3985
y0u kn0w this s0llux
3985
y0u were never g0ing t0 be the team leader th0ugh
3985

y0u picked a t0ugh class tavr0s!
4068
n0ne 0f the really useful c0mbat abilities c0me int0 play until y0u reach a very high level
4068
but i supp0se it will be rewarding when y0u get there
4068
i c0uldnt agree m0re
4068
y0u might be the 0nly flarper in the w0rld wh0 really understands the true spirit 0f the game
4068
every0ne else is s0 aggressive and treasure hungry!
4068
but thats what makes beating them all the m0re satisfying
4068
remember y0ur cl0uder isnt g0ing t0 pull any punches t0night
4068
d0nt fall f0r her mind games

im n0t scared 0f her
4138
she cant c0ntr0l me

4138
wh0 was he anyway
4138
what was he d0ing there
4138
watching us
4138

i feel p0werless sitting here d0ing n0thing th0ugh

are y0u n0t happy ab0ut that
4176
y0u were ab0ut t0 be killed by his hive
4176
pr0ceeding with that plan w0uldnt have made sense
4176
we certainly d0nt need tw0 dead players
4176
yes it was the plan
4176
it had t0 g0 this way
4176
were we ever really friends

i d0nt remember

its n0t revenge

y0u were always supp0sed t0 be 0n the red team
4176
y0ull believe me later

when y0u wake up
4176
ive never th0ught ab0ut revenge at all

ive underst00d f0r s0me time that this will be my r0le
4178
t0 functi0n as y0ur server player
4178
and that y0u w0uld be the team leader as the first in the chain
4178
uh
4178
thats n0t quite the meaning 0f the w0rd server
4178
as y0ur server i manipulate y0ur envir0nment t0 help y0u advance
4178
i supp0se s0

4180
i really have n0 idea what y0ure talking ab0ut

y0u are s0 weird

ribbit
4180
i cant really c0ntr0l the ribbits
4181
yeah i kn0w
4181
sure
4181
what

everything y0u say s0unds strange
4181
0k
4181
i d0nt have pupils
4181
fine
4181
yeah sure
4181
thats pretty much h0w it is anyway

i d0nt have bl00d

0_0
4181
w0w uh
4181
can y0u just bring me the r0b0t already
4181
ribbit
4187
it feels
4187
different!
4187
uh
4187
stirring?
4187
im n0t sure
4187
wait
4187
what is that
4187
this feeling
4187
0h g0d
4187
0H MY G0D WHAT DID Y0U D0!
4188
did y0u pr0gram this r0b0t t0 have feelings f0r y0u?
4188
R0MANTIC FEELINGS???
4188
ANSWER ME BLUE BL00D SCUM
4188
get it 0ut
4188
GET IT 0UT!!!

this private b0ard will and has already served as a l0g 0f past events f0r future selves t0 rec0rd and a guide 0f future events f0r past selves t0 f0ll0w
4490
i d0nt kn0w which half 0f its r0le has been 0r will be m0re imp0rtant
4490
p0ssibly neither is critical since deviati0n fr0m the c0urse is m0stly imp0ssible and reflecti0n 0n its traversal is c0mpletely irrelevant
4490
but im typing this anyway
4490
because im b0red again
4490
and here i was thinking we were finished taking 0rders fr0m v0ices!
4490
weve 0nly swapped the imperatives 0f the dead with th0se 0f 0ur future selves
4490
wh0 are als0 dead
4490
yes it seems that way
4490
0h well it was an enj0yable reprieve fr0m fatalism while it lasted
4490
id nearly managed t0 sav0r it
4490
an err0r narr0wly av0ided then
4490
i think we sh0uld refrain fr0m dial0gue in this mem0
4490
with0ut res0rting t0 bannings 0r absurd exchanges 0f self repudiati0n
4490
yeah i agree
4490
i just th0ught id interject that and g0
4490
0k
4491
we will and have already amassed an army t0 c0nfr0nt the black king
4491
an army c0nsisting 0f 0ur alternate future selves
4491
each 0ne rer0uted fr0m a d00med 0ffsh00t 0f the alpha timeline
4491
each given an0ther chance at a c0nstructive influence 0ver the ultimate 0utc0me
4491
by the way if y0u didnt kn0w already
4491
a future self returning t0 the past fr0m a d00med timeline will always be slated f0r imminent destructi0n herself
4491
its 0ne 0f the rules
4491
and the unf0rtunate reality is
4491
this will and has already been a mass suicide missi0n
4491
0r it w0uld be
4491
and already w0uld have been
4491
if we all werent already dead
4491
0_0
4492
m0bilizing 0urselves in such numbers w0uld be required t0 neutralize the kings psychic attacks
4492
it w0uld take 0ur c0mbined c0ncentrati0n t0 dampen the abilities he inherited fr0m glbg0lyb
4492
with0ut the cumulative eff0rt 0f 0ur d00med reserves
4492
with0ut the heightened mental and physical endurance 0f 0ur r0b0tic vessels
4492
with0ut the untimely demise we all shared bef0re this began
4492
vict0ry w0uld n0t be p0ssible
4492
he w0uld kill us all with 0ne dreadful s0und
4493
i d0nt kn0w if it was just bad luck
4493
0r an extensi0n 0f the curse karkat insists he br0ught 0n us
4493
that lead t0 the incidental and unf0rtuit0us pr0t0typing 0f feferis p0werful lusus
4493
with0ut which the battle w0uld have p0sed little challenge
4493
i think
4493
it was m0re likely just an0ther inevitability
4493
a pr0duct 0f c0llusi0n between the disparate f0rces at play
4493
a bargain struck between what skaia kn0ws already and what the g0ds demand up fr0nt
4493
t0gether they 0rchestrate trials sufficient t0 ensure
4493
that in 0verc0ming them we w0uld be pr0ven w0rthy
4493
0f inheriting
4493
ribbit
4493
wh00ps
4494
and s0 it w0uld be and has been already
4494
that while distracted by the c0mbined eff0rts 0f 0ur d00med legi0n
4494
the king w0uld be aggressed by the 0thers
4494
and even th0ugh each w0uld be well prepared
4494
perched 0n the highest rungs 0f their echeladders
4494
equipped with the best weap0nry grist c0uld build
4494
versed in the deadliest fraym0tifs b00nd0llars c0uld buy
4495
even th0ugh the mete0rs fr0m the kings 0wn reck0ning w0uld be turned against him
4496
and even with 0ne imp0ssibly lucky r0ll 0f the dice at the final m0ment
4497
we w0uld 0nly narr0wly succeed
4498
but ultimately
4499
we w0uld pr0ve 0ur w0rth
4500
and the reward w0uld be within 0ur reach
4501
but 0nly m0mentarily
4502
bef0re we w0uld be able t0 claim it
4502
we w0uld be interrupted
4502
by s0mething
4502
which w0uld be ushered int0 0ur sessi0n by a rift in parad0x space
4502
a rift which we w0uld determine
4502
will be 0pened by f0ur members 0f a fledgling species
4502
wh0 will be playing in an0ther sessi0n 0f the same game that we will and have already played
4503
their rift will lead t0 the great und0ing
4503
with0ut necessarily causing it
4503
n0t directly
4503
such rifts are themselves supp0sedly benign
4503
useful even
4503
they are catal0gued phen0mena within the game itself
4503
with a pr0vided means 0f creating them
4503
and a wide range 0f scenari0s f0r which it might be prudent t0 d0 s0
4503
the incipisphere l0cals have a m0re f0rmal term f0r them
4503
they typically refer t0 such a rift as
4504
a scratch
4505
the direct effects 0f a scratch are limited t0 the sessi0n inv0king it
4505
we w0uld n0t experience 0r 0bserve th0se effects fr0m 0ur sessi0n
4505
but we w0uld experience the c0nsequences
4505
in the f0rm 0f that which prevented us fr0m claiming 0ur reward
4505
he wh0se hand w0uld be f0rced by the scratch
4505
t0 emerge fr0m hiding
4506
but there w0uld be n0 adequate way t0 prepare
4506
even with all the f0resight at 0ur disp0sal
4506
f0r a f0e m0re p0werful than the king we will and have already defeated
4506
f0r a dem0n wh0 is indestructible
4506
0mnip0tent
4506
and enraged
4507
while the rest 0f the party w0uld absc0nd
4507
0ur duplicates w0uld buy us time
4507
they w0uld all be killed
4507
again
4508
all except f0r me
4508
this is just as well i supp0se
4508
what w0uld we even d0 with all th0se c0pies anyway
4509
we w0uld return t0 the site 0f 0ur hatching
4509
s0 t0 speak
4509
where we w0uld hide
4509
amidst a veil depleted by the reck0ning
4509
and wait
4509
drifting in the wide 0rbit 0f 0ur s00n t0 be null sessi0n
4510
banished fr0m the  we left behind
4517
and yet in being denied
4518
we w0uld be barred fr0m entry
4524
int0 the  we created
4529
i will n0t be participating
4708
what d0 y0u think y0ure d0ing!
4708
just st0p
4708
st0p st0p st0p st0p st0p st0p
4708
maybe if i say st0p en0ugh s0mething else will happen instead 0f the thing that d0es
4708
y0u arent g0ing t0 st0p are y0u
4708
n0 i d0nt care ab0ut that
4708
its y0ur quest t0 tear y0ur sessi0n apart
4708
i kn0w its exciting
4708
breaking stuff
4708
and n0t w0rrying ab0ut it
4708
but there are c0nsequences t0 hum0ring y0ur destructive impulses
4708
and c0nsequences t0 f0ll0wing
4708
what they say
4708
y0u kn0w wh0
4708
i d0nt even need t0 watch y0ur future acti0ns t0 kn0w this
4708
the kn0wing is the same as this elusive feeling 0f sickness thats been with me f0r years
4708
pr0bably since bef0re i died c0me t0 think 0f it
4708
it was always a big setup
4708
n0
4708
i never had 0ne
4708
s0rt 0f a special case here
4708
i just wish
4708
back when i was behaving recklessly
4708
i had s0me0ne t0 tell me t0 st0p listening
4708
even if i ended up ign0ring their advice
4708
it w0uld have been nice
4708
i was assured i w0uld be saving my race
4708
which is maybe still true i d0nt kn0w
4708
but if it is then it will be the punchline t0 the vast j0ke
4708
y0u really d0nt understand anything yet d0 y0u
4708
and yet y0u bug and fuss and meddle
4708
with things m0re danger0us than y0u can imagine

what d0 y0u want with the s0urce 0f the first guardians
4709
what g00d d0 y0u really think c0uld c0me 0f it
4709
y0u cant p0ssibly wield its energy 0r put it t0 c0nstructive use
4709
y0u w0nt find it either
4709
its imp0ssible
4709
n0!
4709
y0u still havent gathered that y0ure the pr0blem
4709
im thr0ugh with c0nsci0usly c0ntributing t0 inevitable 0utc0mes
4709
0bvi0usly
4709
but im just talking
4709
maybe the things i say will indirectly trigger y0ur critical acti0ns
4709
maybe n0t wh0 kn0ws
4709
maybe!!!
4709
maybe if i behave in a manner s0 rand0m
4709
parad0x space w0nt kn0w h0w t0 handle it!
4709
blah BL00P blee BLUH!@#$%^&*()_+
4709
didnt see that 0ne c0ming did y0u pspace??? + ?*rand(413^612)
4709
oh look and now i suddenly refuse to type zeroes in my sentences
4709
isnt that crazy! who thought that was even a possibility
4709
bslick never would have imagined THAT little vestibule of probability was tucked somewhere in his huge glistening blow sack
4709
ribbit ribbit ribbit
4709
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT
4709
I JUST CONTROLLED THE RIBBITS AND I DID IT DELIBERATELY
4709
hahaha!
4709
0h w0w im sure y0u were just being faceti0us with that but y0u have n0 idea h0w funny that is right n0w
4709
y0u had n0 way 0f kn0wing thats a thing i d0 all the time but with zer0es
4709
this is great
4709
i think im 0n t0 s0mething here
4709
maybe if i dig deep en0ugh int0 my circuitry and rer0ute all 0f my reserve p0wer thr0ugh my quantum based rand0m number generat0r i can pr0duce behavi0r s0 c0mpletely 0ff the wall that parad0x space will have n0 ch0ice but t0 change everything!
4709
maybe i will also rig my p0wer s0urce t0 the 0utc0me 0f the functi0n and rand0mly bl0w myself up!
4709
that w0uld be just

really

4709
g00dbye r0se
4709
enj0y y0ur rampant indiscreti0ns

5082
hi
5082
i guess i sh0uld say s0mething
5082
bef0re i g0
5082
i kn0w
5082
but this is hard f0r me
5082
n0 thats n0t true
5082
s0rry ab0ut everything
5082
and all the bad luck y0uve had
5082
y0u didnt deserve it
5082
i have t0 g0 n0w
5082
im n0t sure
5082
anyway thats it
5082
i d0nt kn0w that either
5082
but i guess if y0u d0
5082
pr0bably n0t with y0ur eyes
5082
i think y0ull be 0k with it th0ugh
5082
0_0
5082
i wish
5082
i c0uld s0meh0w make that em0tic0n smile
5082
0u0
5082
n0 that l00ks stupid
5082
0h well
5381
hello!
5381
i think its absurd i never introduced myself to you in all that time i spent moping around the lab
5381
guess i wasnt in a very good mood
5381
hi dave my names aradia
5381
um
5381
6 a girl and a place very close to you
5381
in fact
5381
i could visit you right now if you would like
5381
to be fair it translates to the same age as you which at the moment is 12 is it not
5381
understanding disparities in the flow of time should be easy for people like us let alone understanding disparities in such pedestrian things as units
5381
i am 6 sweeps old one sweep is a little more than 2 years you dummy!
5381
look it is either the truth or i am just someone who is being a bit playful what is the harm in that
5381
:D
5382
i know you arent
5382
but i am
5382
maid of time
5382
whereas you are the knight of the very same cosmic faculty
5382
it would seem we have very little in common dave
5382
when in fact we have very much
5382
yes
5382
thats definitely what you did the first time we had this conversation
5382
so i will wait patiently while you realize thats not what youre going to do this time
5382
dave describe to me why you are now incredulous please
5382
of course you remember that
5382
this is a memory
5382
come to the window
5382
because im outside
5382
take a look
5382
that iiis
5382
becaaause
5382
im not out there anymore!
5382
turn around
5383
yeah
5384
try to remember
5385
are you sure
5385
why indeed!
5386
yes
5386
i think it looks pretty nice but go on
5386
no
5386
sorry
5386
not exactly
5388
yes
5388
yes and no
5388
yes and 2 nos!
5388
it is the afterlife
5388
but what is happening now is taking place in a bubble which is accessible to the living through dreams under the right conditions
5388
and it is also your memory
5388
the entry point for any bubble is always a memory
5388
either a memory of the dead
5388
or a memory of the living dreamer come to visit!
5388
but once you realize it is not just a memory
5388
what happens next is up to you
5389
no this actually did happen
5389
thats because it isnt your memory
5389
this is alpha dave
5389
the one who chose not to take the nap which led to your death
5389
did she
5389
didnt you ask for this
5389
evidently
5389
yes yes and yes
5389
yes it can be on the table and yes reality still means something
5389
and yes your guardian did die
5389
nothing
5389
all is well and as it should be
5389
what would you be doing there if you were him
5389
even better!
5389
would you be upset
5389
then maybe what you are doing is grieving
5389
in whatever way that comes naturally to you
5389
you are lucky to be able to
5389
i could not for a long time
5389
but now that i can again im so relieved
5389
because i have discovered there is no reason to grieve!
5389
looks like it
5389
who do you suspect you would be talking to in this situation
5389
maybe she is helping you through this
5389
you were helping her werent you
5389
i think so
5389
the living need each others help
5389
just like the dead do
5389
alpha dave still has a long way to go
5389
hes still not at ease with his mortality
5389
but people like us have to be!
5389
we have to be prepared to die a thousand deaths before our quest is complete
5389
the master we serve demands it
5389
pretty much
5389
they come here too
5389
in their own bubbles
5389
you may cross paths with them if you wish
5389
ha
5389
i know the feeling :)
5389
im not showing you im just visiting your bubble
5389
it projects your thoughts and memories
5389
as well as other things relevant to you much like the clouds do in skaia
5389
nothing
5389
none of this is your business anymore
5389
its time to move on
5390
oh look this was my hive!
5390
before it was destroyed
5390
what did you picture
5390
thats very silly and a little perverse
5390
but actually that sounds like what it might have been like on some parts of the planet sooo
5390
ill put in a good word with your bubble about it
5390
i dont know about hauntoffs
5390
but there is plenty of time to satisfy various curiosities you might have about existence and whatnot
5390
is it
5390
oh! yes
5390
there are all sorts of friends to meet
5390
ones you already know and ones you dont
5390
there is plenty of time for just about anything
5390
lots and lots of time
5390
enough time to understand that time isnt much of anything at all
5390
time is like a game
5390
just one fun game in realitys cupboard which is full of them
5390
its the one we are the best at!
5390
while other people are better at the other games
5390
but when all the games are back in the cupboard everyone is about the same
5390
and games are fun but sometimes you dont realize how much fun you were having until theyre all over
5390
and sometimes you look back and realize for some stupid reason you werent having any fun at all!
5390
then you laugh
5390
that laugh will suffice
5390
hey!
5390
want to see inside my hive
5390
it is quite possible and more than ok
5391
it seems you have a hiveguest dave
5391
tavros has been looking forward to meeting you
5391
yes you figured out the mystery!
5391
you may think so but then again you have not faced team charge in a match of slam poetry have you
5391
just kidding im no good at slam poetry haha sorry
5391
yes hes dead
5391
no i am wide awake
5391
and i physically stand before you in person!
5391
oh no
5392
i am very much alive
5392
and i intend to stay that way :)
5490
s0llux!
5490
y0u will never guess what i just f0und
5490
i d0ubt it
5490
um
5490
yes
5490
h0w did y0u kn0w!
5490
yeah
5490
me t00
5490
what d0 y0u think it means?
5490
i d0nt kn0w maybe
5490
maybe y0urs are t00?
5490
wait
5490
yes
5490
shes very quiet th0ugh i cant tell what shes saying!
5490
g00d idea
5490
0k d0 y0u remember what we talked ab0ut regarding kanayas ruins?
5490
i asked y0u f0r help in understanding the glyphs
5490
0_0
5490
are y0u just being difficult 0r d0 y0u really n0t remember
5490
well 0bvi0usly!
5490
but i really appreciate y0ur help anyway
5490
well y0u said that y0ud need an0ther set 0f glyphs t0 make sense 0f them
5490
y0u speculated that there might be an0ther set 0f ruins
5490
y0u even guessed they w0uld be blue! it turns 0ut y0u were right
5490
d0nt y0u think that is pretty c00l?
5490
but y0u say that ab0ut everything!
5490
n0 its n0t!
5490
i did find s0me 0ther neat things d0wn here t00 which are strange but quite harmless and n0t f0reb0ding in the least!
5490
like this AMAZING hat!
5490
it is an authentic arche0l0gists hat its s0 hard t0 find them in this style
5490
there are n0 h0rn h0les but i l0ve it anyway its great
5490
i wasnt g0ing t0 tell y0u ab0ut that!
5490
damn it h0w did y0u kn0w
5490
this is stupid
5490
maybe
5490
well
5490
0k
5490
ahem
5490
sorry to interrupt i wanted to give you both the chance to remember but it doesnt look like this is going anywhere!
5490
w0w what
5491
is it coming back yet
5491
this is a mem0ry
5491
in a dream bubble
5491
thats right!
5491
y0u changed y0ur v0ice because y0u remembered
5491
like i did
5491
that i died
5491
this is my mem0ry and als0 hers
5491
but i went 0n t0 bec0me the r0b0t wh0se remains are in this crater
5491
whereas she did n0t
5491
i d0nt actually kn0w her st0ry 0r h0w she g0t here but f0r me this was the end 0f the r0ad
5491
this is the afterlife
5491
nope!
5492
you are just asleep
5492
you are also blind!
5492
yes thats what being blind means
5492
sollux will you shut up and stop being so tragic for once
5492
you knew this was going to happen! your prophecies of personal doom were practically all you ever talked about
5492
i think you were looking forward to this honestly
5492
shes right
5492
great!
5492
you should be able to relax now that youve been released from the curse of your vision twofold just like you said youd be
5492
you are now merely doomed!
5492
being d00med isnt that bad
5492
i spent m0st 0f my life that way remember
5492
at least y0u have the luxury 0f understanding
5492
and the best part ab0ut being d00med is y0u 0nly have t0 put up with it until y0u die
5492
thats the spirit hahaha
5492
actually i guess i dont have to keep talking like im doomed anymore do i
5492
nope :)
5492
hahahahaha!
5492
hahahahaha!
5492
i
5492
dont know?
5492
really?
5492
what noise?
5492
oh its jade!
5492
whos jade
5492
shes one of the humans we met after you died
5492
ok
5492
i guess i am out of the loop on chronology for once
5492
thats fine youll catch up!
5493
no dont!
5493
sollux try to be polite
5493
there is no reason at all for you to feel hostile toward them anymore
5493
jade is very nice and she did nothing wrong
5493
none of them did so when you wake up maybe you should try to reconcile with them or at the very least just say hello
5493
did i what
5493
well no
5493
but i should have!
5493
i did with you before i left didnt i
5493
this is awkward
5493
shush you!
5493
what actually happened after i died it sounds complicated
5493
it is!
5493
ill get you up to speed i promise but guys come on lets not scare away our guest
5493
ok then ill shut up
5493
i think one aradia saying things is more than enough probably
5493
oh my god shut up!
5493
no jade its ok
5493
please stay! im curious about why you are here
5493
navigating between bubbles is difficult here
5493
its better to drift between them naturally as they intersect
5493
not spatially but through common points in memory
5493
to navigate the furthest ring you need to have mastered the flow of time!
5493
that is why i am here
5493
i am alive again so i may assist the dead in this way
5493
jade tell me
5493
have you seen me here before? i mean me dressed like i am now wearing my godhood
5493
im wearing a hood and have butterfly wings what else would you like to know
5493
yes sollux that would probably be pretty weird
5493
thank you your outfit is quite spiffy too
5493
i like that skirt a lot especially
5493
is
5493
is that a skirt?
5493
shhh!
5493
yes ok
5493
you see those encounters you had with me before have not happened for me yet because ive only just arrived
5493
time follows strange paths here as does space
5493
if you travel a great enough distance you may discover you are also traveling either backwards or forwards in time as well!
5493
just as if you stay in one place for too long the geometry of space surrounding you will become unreliable
5493
you may swat the air to your left and discover you have just slapped yourself!
5493
the only way to make sense of it is to understand either property very well
5493
and since i am new here i have some learning to do just like everyone else
5493
but i do know one thing
5493
i knew that the first bubble i would enter would be an important one for us to visit
5493
hang on
5493
we are moving on to a new memory hold that thought
5494
it is important because it will help us begin to understand why we are all here
5494
no no
5494
not why we are in this bubble now
5494
but why we all exist in the first place and why we all went on this adventure together
5494
there is much to understand and i believe it all begins with one sequence of events
5494
watching will help those whove passed to understand the purpose of their sacrifice and those still living to understand what must be done to complete the journey still ahead
5494
we will let the memories lead the way
5494
are you guys ready?
5495
ok lets allow the next memory to take shape
5495
i believe it is kanayas
5495
i will reprise my role in a conversation i had with her shortly after i discovered the ruins
5495
everybody hide and try not to spoil it for her until she remembers!
5496
hey kanaya
5496
there is s0mething i want t0 give y0u
5496
yes its s0mething very 0dd i f0und when i disc0vered the ruins the 0ther night
5496
i d0nt kn0w what its arche0l0gical significance is yet but i suspect y0u will be able t0 repair it!
5496
0_0
5496
w0w!
5496
uh i mean
5496
o_o
5496
wow
5496
you figured that out very fast!
5496
oh i am sure you are alive
5496
you are unconscious now and will likely wake up as your new self very soon
5496
yes
5496
you are undergoing a metamorphosis which you have been groomed for since you were very young
5496
much like i was for my various personal iterations including this one
5496
yes!
5496
but it sure sounds silly when you list them all like that
5496
wellllll
5496
that is what we are about to find out!
5496
if you will oblige us by continuing with this memory
5496
why dont we go through this conversation again to the best of our recollection
5496
but i guess rather than acting it out we can just talk about it
5496
the old fashioned way
5496
i have no idea
5496
haha yeah you know what i mean though
5496
yes
5496
i then had sollux deliver the pieces to you so you could stitch it back up
5496
sollux that is your cue!
5496
come out and play the part
5496
no of course not!
5496
obviously the jig is up everyone can come out now
5497
no guys come on this isnt that complicated!
5497
we are just revisiting the past just like we would if we were talking about it
5497
but it just so happens we can watch it happen as we talk about it
5497
and as a matter of fact
5497
this story does involve a role playing game but not in that way!
5497
youre stupid and you sound stupid!
5497
i dont know o_o
5497
but you maaay be waking up soon
5497
maybe not if we hurry this along!
5497
thollux is right
5497
i mean sollux
5497
kanaya tell us what happened next!
5498
yes
5498
not really!
5498
yes
5498
bye sollux
5498
this is only a piece of the story
5498
the other pieces will fall into place with successive memories and it will all become clear
5498
but yes alright i will eliminate some suspense and try to serve as a better guide on this tour through the catacombs of our collective subconscious
5498
the separate tunnels we once traveled in the dark as individuals we now retrace together with a torch
5498
on the walls we illuminate the runes which describe a convoluted origin story
5498
an origin we participated in
5498
we were spurred to these actions by that which was being originated
5498
and incited to acts of revenge as we were turned against each other
5499
no
5499
our manipulator disguised his tracks well
5499
no tavros you can get up
5499
we will leave it soon
5499
but you were doing something very important here
5499
writing a part of the code
5500
an incomplete fragment consisting of four symbols
5500
comprising the first word of a binary refrain
5500
a pair of sounds emerging from the belly of a fabled tyrants menace
5500
but you authored only one sound of the pair
5501
i would write the other
5502
in the soot of my ruined hive i scrawled my part of the code
5502
completing the phrase of legend
5502
the persisting sounds said to accompany the ultimate demise of the tyrant less an arm and an eye
5502
but even these eight characters
5502
the scrawlings of charge
5502
were still but half the code
5503
there was another half by scourge in two parts
5503
one part three symbols
5504
and the other
5504
five
5504
why the scale was tipped in this way between sisters
5504
i cannot say!
5505
each fragment would be transcribed in our rulebooks
5505
sealing the collaboration between rust bloods and blue bloods
5505
completing the code for our sessions architect
5505
not exactly
5506
there was another fragment
5506
oh?
5506
yes
5506
an additional eight symbols
5506
from a wild card source i suppose
5507
it came from a timeline not meant to happen
5507
the one i came from to ensure it wouldnt
5507
thus sealing my fate
5508
i believed the fragment was gibberish from a lunatic
5508
after completing his rampage through our session
5508
since it was not part of the scripted chronology i was oblivious until it was too late to stop it
5508
not that it would matter if i did the timeline had already gone astray
5508
i pieced together what had happened by sleuthing the various scenes
5509
and discovered the text which the code was recorded in
5509
i decided to return to the alpha timeline with the text
5509
as evidence for his madness i guess
5509
in the alpha timeline this text was destroyed
5509
in an explosion caused by a computer virus
5509
this explosion did not take place on my timeline
5509
i identified this event as the difference prompting the offshoot
5509
and returned to our planet via the reckoning just as i did at the end of my life
5509
though that time deliberately
5509
to influence events quietly to make sure it happened
5509
and later joined the rest of our doomed selves to help defeat the king
5509
the others surely had similar responsibilities along the way
5510
as for the book
5510
i lost track of it shortly after i arrived
5510
yes we all lost track of our books
5511
they were gathered surreptitiously by agents assigned to the task
5512
and in the veil their codes were merged with the ghost imprints of other mysterious artifacts
5513
our first guardian was brought to life on the seed to pass through skaias final gate of defense
5513
the first to find alternia
5898
hey what are you doing out here!
5898
out of your bubble
5898
i just didnt think you could
5898
i guess you must have a foot on either side
5898
cant say im surprised!
5899
i am waiting for friends to arrive
5899
they will need my help
5899
no theyre alive
5899
first
5899
there will be two humans
5899
they should be joining us any minute
5899
then rest of our party
5899
the survivors
5899
yes
5899
well
5899
they made it
5899
your body will arrive with them
5899
along with the others
5899
hey maybe we can have a funeral!
5899
kind of like
5899
a big corpse party
5899
the humans could probably explain it better than me
5900
you can see the sun?
6249
you see??
6249
i told you they would bring your body
6249
oh!!!
6249
sollux lets do it!
6249
the corpse party!
6249
theres no better time and there are so many corpses here to work with
6249
is everybody ok with that? do you want to have a big corpse party?
6249
we can incinerate the remains in the sun it will be just glorious
6249
rose!
6249
can you please explain to my friends what a human funeral is like?
6249
i couldnt have put it better myself
6249
could you go into more detail?
6249
hmmm that sounds just a tad specific
6249
we may have to adapt the proceedings to be a little more
6249
i dunno
6249
multicultural i guess?
6249
why dont you all do some brainstorming about what kind of funeral to have while i go round up the bodies!
6249
whats the matter?
6249
um
6249
i just thought it would be a nice thing to bond over
6249
am i really that bad?
6249
oh
6249
sorry
6249
i guess ive spent enough time here that i just dont see death as the terrible thing the living make it out to be
6249
i honestly feel like its a reason to celebrate!
6249
death fan girl thing?
6249
what do you mean
6249
you think so?
6250
the sun will never be destroyed karkat
6250
im sorry but you were misinformed!
6254
karkat i dont know if anyone cares about formal ranks like that anymore
6254
or if anyone ever did!
6254
but for what its worth i suggest that from now on you all listen closely to the advice of our human guests
6254
yes!
6254
no need to be so modest dave
6254
tactically speaking a knight of time and a seer of light is a nearly unbeatable combination
6254
yes you are off to an excellent start as a subordinate
6254
keep doing that!
6254
but dave dont worry if you do not have instructions for us
6254
the knight of time is not necessarily the tactician
6254
he is a powerful warrior class which exploits the flow of time as a weapon
6254
rose is the one who must play the role of the strategist
6254
the seer class knows her aspect comprehensively
6254
as a knower of all fortune she can see the circuitous path that will lead to the most favorable outcome for everyone
6254
personally i would defer to her judgment!
6255
this is why you all needed an advanced seer!
6255
i have become familiar with the ways of the fabric out here but even i couldnt chart a journey that long or complex
6256
karkat go back to holding your breath!
6256
this is going to be a wonderful adventure for everyone
6256
im a bit jealous honestly!
6256
or i would be if i wasnt having such a good time with my death fangirl thing :p
6256
no
6256
i still have important work to do here
6256
but that doesnt rule out the possibility we could meet again in bubbles along your journey!
6256
but kanaya you still have important work to finish too!
6256
we cant ignore our duties
6256
our race is extinct remember
6256
and after a few more casualties it is now hanging by a thread
6256
your job was to see to the resurrection of our people
6256
theres always hope though!
6256
you just never know and i dont think you should give up
6257
oh nooo :(
6285
i can help with that!
6285
sollux do you think you can lend me a hand?
6285
theyll need the biggest push we can give them
6285
ok you guys can keep arguing if you like but im going to send you on your way now
6285
then after you leave i should be able to buy you a little more time
6285
when jack comes ill slow him down for a while
6285
it wont be for very long but its the best i can do!
6285
youre welcome!
6285
are you ready sollux?
7855
hello.
7855
thanks!
7855
yes im alive
7855
(sollux dont make our guest uncomfortable)
7855
really i havent thought about any of that in a long time
7855
ancient conflicts dont mean anything to me anymore but i was more than thrilled by the opportunity to go on another adventure like this
7855
we used to enjoy such campaigns together all the time when we were younger
7855
of course now the teams are a little different :)
7855
ive met most of those nepetas theyre all very nice
7926
yes
7926
ok
7926
:)
7926
about what exactly
7926
you mean searching for the weapon?
7926
i think its a good idea
7926
thats probably the only way to find it
7926
in my experience the specific path you travel out here is very important
7926
if we did not trace that exact path in that amount of time i doubt we ever would have found the right location
7926
in fact it may never have been found by anyone
7926
i couldnt say
7926
its probably necessary
7926
and they would have embarked on this voyage whether i had come along or not
7926
so i might as well join the fun!
7926
isnt that what you did when you saw our ship?
7926
yes but once you found out you continued journeying with us
7926
exactly!
7927
i dont necessarily share their point of view on the meaning of this endeavor though
7927
they consider this to be a great clash between good and evil
7927
but i prefer to look at the coming battle as a matter of housekeeping
7927
in the end all loops must be tidied up
7927
even his
7927
of course i do!
7927
i love all my friends
7927
do i seem cheerful about that
7927
i apologize if that is the way i am behaving
7927
it is not true though
7927
i think i look at death differently than most
7927
and it is fair to say this attitude extends to death after death as well
7927
i have learned to be at ease with the cessation of being in any form it takes
7927
but i am not nor will i ever be the monsters handmaid
7927
so please believe that i would never take joy from the destruction of any soul
7927
however you must realize that it is only by the grace of the horrorterrors that so many have been allowed to continue existing for so long
7927
they have persisted for ages beyond their time just as he has
7927
as such it seems to me his rampage is just another kind of housekeeping
7927
while he rounds the ring undoing the work of the gods we must prepare for his undoing as well
7927
to ready the manor for the lords arrival so to speak :)
7927
i dont like to think of myself in those terms
7927
but i do try to be nice to people!
7927
what i want?
7927
hmmm
7927
thats a pretty good question
7928
i think i mostly want to see what happens when this whole place breaks apart
7931
:(
7945
i understand sollux
7945
yeah :D
7982
:D
7982
:D
7991
:D
7993
sounds like a dare to me
