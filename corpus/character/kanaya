Why Is It That When The Subject Of Temporal Mechanics Is Broached Your Sparing Human Intellects Instantly Assume The Most Ingratiating Posture Of Surrender Imaginable
2993
Time Is Not That Difficult To Understand
2993
It Is A Utility That A Universe May Resort To In Order To Advance A Desired Degree Of Complexity
2993
Or May Not Resort To If That Is The Case
2993
Its All Pretty Pedestrian
2993
But No
2993
When Time Travel Comes Up You Present The Face That A Man Shows When The Breeze Gradually Alerts Him To His Absence Of Netherdressings
2993
I Dont See How We Are To Properly Agitate You All If You Continue To Insist On Failing To Understand Basic Concepts Which Common Infants Effortlessly Manage To Describe Via Scrawlings In Their Own Puddles Of Sloppy Discharge
2993
Yes
2993
In The Future
2993
Oh My It Is Your Human Sarcasm Again
2993
I Enjoy Listening To It And I Wish Doing So Could Serve As My Primary Form Of Recreation
2993
There See I Just Did It Too
2993
Saying The Opposite Thing To Emphasize My Contempt
2993
But Suddenly I Feel More Primitive And Hate Myself A Little More
2993
It Was Like This Funny Miracle That Just Happened In My Heart
2993
Oh Dear
2993
No We Arent From "The Future"
2993
But We Are All Already In Agreement That You Dont Get It And Never Will
2993
We Did
2993
Your Future
2993
For Me It Was Only A Couple Minutes Ago
2993
Yes Thats Right
2993
Will You Try To Talk Some Sense Into Your Idiot Friends
2993
So That We May Proceed To Bother Them All On More Rational Terms
2993
I Will Admit This Campaign Of Provocation Wasnt All That Well Thought Out
2993
Dont Tell Anyone I Said That
2993
Yeah Maybe
2993
Why Dont We Be Friends
2993
I Think So
2993
I Think Were Supposed To
2993
You Suggested As Much Earlier
2993
Yes A Couple Minutes Ago
2993
Thats Likely
3489
You Command The Seer
3489
So You May Have Some Insight Into Her Disposition
3489
The One Who Is A Little Snooty
3489
Thats An Exotic Title
3489
I Thought You Were The Knight
3489
Have You Found Her Demeanor To Be Chilly
3489
On A Basis Of Personal Interaction That Hypothetically Extends Beyond The Context Of A Short Lived And Lackluster Trolling Effort
3489
I Thought Your Familiarity With Her May Allow You To Furnish Me Insight
3489
She And You Are Familiar Isnt That Right
3489
She Perhaps Even Regards You With Uh
3489
Endearment
3489
Um Is This
3489
A Common Sort Of Practice In Human Courtship
3489
Watching Oblong Meat Products Tumble Into Places They Dont Belong
3489
Am I Being Accused Of Falling Prey To The Human Dysfunction Of Amorous Inclination
3489
I Just Would Like To Gather
3489
Some Means Of Gauging Her Sincerity
3489
Maddening
3489
How Do Humans Forge Meaningful Relationships Using Such Communication Patterns
3489
Perhaps It Is The Human Riddle That Is Truly The Ultimate Riddle
3489
It Was Not A Sincere Remark
3489
I Have Been Practicing
3489
Your Human Sarcasm
3489
Very Well
3489
I Am Beginning To Feel As Though I Am The Only One Working On Our Friendship
3489
That Was Sincerity
3489
Then
3489
Keep Saying The Opposite Things
3489
It Sounds Like
3489
You Are Advising Me To Troll Her Again
3489
Which I Have Tried
3489
It Proved To Be A Fruitless Endeavor
3489
Okay
3489
I Believe I Understand How To Proceed
3492
Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You
3492
I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism
3492
What Do You Think About This
3492
Ah See It Is Working Already
3492
Ive Listened To His Advice
3492
And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly
3492
I Know What I Have To Do
3492
What We Have To Do Really
3492
Remember The First Time We Spoke
3492
The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You
3492
This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You
3492
Thats Next Time
3492
Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply
3492
4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6
3492
Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible
3492
But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That
3492
See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe
3492
Yes
3492
That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now
3492
I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log
3492
Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed
3492
I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant
3492
But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It
3492
So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless
3492
!
3492
Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place
3492
Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression
3492
!!!
3492
Yes
3492
Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me
3492
Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit
3492
The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw
3492
Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development
3492
By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground
3492
In Successive Conversations
3492
4=3 And 5=4 And Such
3492
Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation
3492
But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now
3492
They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation
3492
Yes
3492
It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities
3492
I Dont Understand
3492
Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time
3492
I'm Hopping To 8=8
3492
Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought
3614
Im Supposed To Antagonize A Few Members Of Your Trivial Species
3614
I Have To Start Somewhere
3614
And Somewhen
3614
So I Am Starting With You
3614
And Now
3614
Its Going To Be Pointless And Unpleasant
3614
Mostly For Me
3614
Actually You Know What
3614
Im Not Really Feeling This At All
3614
Goodbye
3614
Is This
3614
Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About
3614
That You Always Use
3614
And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate
3614
I Thought That Was The Thing You Did
3614
The Rose Human Specifically
3614
Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements
3614
Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful
3614
Have We Spoken Before
3614
Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation
3614
I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
3614
So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
3614
Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest
3614
It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things
3614
Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To
3614
He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is
3614
Uh Okay
3614
Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This
3614
I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now
3614
Maybe
3614
When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him
3614
Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart
3614
And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics
3614
I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here
3614
Kind Of Irritating
3614
Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades
3614
This John Human
3614
And Figure Out Whats Going On
3614
Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.
3614
Until Next Time Rose
3614
Next Time In The Past
3615
If Youre Not Too Busy Still Setting Up The Network
3615
Perhaps You Could Come Show Me How To Activate The Viewport
3615
My Keyboard Is Missing The F1 Key
3615
You Used To Like To Talk More
3615
If I Recall I Was Typically The One Who Would Solicit Reprieves From Your Nonsense
3615
So I Dont Know What Happened
3615
Then Why Are You Doing This
3615
Setting Up These Stations For Us
3615
I Did Fiddle With It
3615
To No Avail
3838
Hello Again
3838
Are We Friends Yet At This Point In Time
3838
I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be
3838
Furthermore Which Rose Have You Chosen To Be This Time
3838
The Stupid Rose Or The Smart Rose
3838
It Sounds Like You Are Attempting To Be The Smart Rose This Time
3838
Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting
3838
Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That
3838
Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She
3838
Whereas Dumb Rose Doesn't Capitalize Letters Even When Discussing The Proper Names Of Human Monsters In Earth Cinema
3838
I Think You Should Establish A Greater Commitment To A Single Roleplaying Scenario
3838
I Suddenly Dont Understand Anything
3838
What Are You Talking About
3838
I Believe I Understand
3838
It Was I Who Did Something To Provoke Your Scorn In A Previous Conversation
3838
One Which I Have Not Had Yet
3838
Fine
4039
Hi Again Aradia
4039
So I Guess Tonight Is The Night You Blow Everything Up
4039
Is There Nothing I Can Do To Change Your Mind
4039
Yeah I Guess Not
4039
I Thought Id Be Friendly Though
4039
And Remind You That You Do In Fact Have A Hand In All The Terrible Things That Are About To Happen
4039
Because Thats What Friends Are For
4039
And The Fact That What Ensues Will Be Terrible
4039
Is An Immutable Fact I Am Stating For The Record
4039
And The Fact That We Will Not Be On The Same Team Is Similarly Immutable
4039
It Does Not Mean That Teamwork Is What Isnt Taking Place Here
4039
Ill Be Here To Help
4039
If You Need Me
4104
Just Wanted To Know
4104
Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
4104
Uh No
4104
You Sure Do Seem To Be Saying Cahoots
4104
Im Just Asking
4104
Because Mines Dead
4104
It Was Just Her Time
4104
No There Was No Plot Or Conspiracy Or Any Trace Of Saboteurs Operating Through The Special And Magical Union One Can Only Describe As Being In Cahoots With Another
4104
When A Virgin Mother Grub Abdicates And Renounces Brooding
4104
Her Time Will Be Relatively Short
4104
I Always Knew This
4104
Maybe You Still Can
4104
They Are All Dying
4104
Or Are Going To Soon
4104
I Believe Its A Preemptive Consequence Of The Game We Are About To Play
4104
If A Preemptive Consequence Is A Concept That Can Be Said To Hold Any Meaning
4104
But From What I Understand If It Is Applicable In Any Sphere At All Then This Game Holds That Sphere
4104
I Wasnt Going To Think That
4104
You Know What I Dont Think Even I Really Understand What I Just Said So Nevermind
4104
Yes A Few
4104
Karkat Thinks Its His Fault
4104
He Believes His Actions Triggered An Inauspicious Chain Reaction
4104
Sure
4104
Im Not Surprised To See You Endorse His Paranoia Without Hesitation
4104
But I Was Attempting To Illustrate A Point In Bringing It Up
4104
These Events Are Inevitable And Regardless Of Whatever Emotional Entanglements Obfuscate Their Significance They Will Ultimately Serve An Important Purpose
4104
The Curse Had Nothing To Do With It
4104
And Karkats Notion Of A Curse Is Inseparable From His Perception Of Events As Intrinsically Negative And As Tailored To His Personal Dissatisfaction
4104
And Your Bad Luck Is The Same Way
4104
I Believe Anyway
4104
What Would Happen If You Just Cleaned Up A Bit
4104
Dont You Think You Would Step On A Few Less Hard Triangles
4104
Because Youre Dangerous
4104
Every Time You Tell Me To Can It I Think Its Funny
4104
I Mean Its Just A Funny Thing To Say Dont You Think
4104
Its Ok To Be Dangerous
4104
Lots Of People Are
4104
And Dangerous People Can Be Really Important
4104
Maybe Even The Most Important Sometimes
4104
But It Just Means Theres Got To Be Someone Around To Keep An Eye On Them
4104
And If Not Me Then Who
4104
Everyone Has An Important Job To Do
4104
That Wouldnt Work
4104
If I Tried To Stop You You Would Regard Me As An Enemy
4104
Instead Of Merely As A Nuisance
4104
And What Good Would That Do
4104
So Im Afraid Mcfussyfangs It Must Be
4104
Youre Right Anything Can Happen I Guess
4104
But Just So You Know Im Sorry For Your Loss In Advance
4228
Hey
4228
You Seem More Excited Than Usual
4228
Or Less
4228
I Cant Tell
4228
Help Me Tell Without Saying Glub
4228
Im Going To Type This Face Now
4228
:?
4228
Even Though No One Knows How To Make A Mouth Do A Question Shape Like That
4228
Yes You Can
4228
But Thats Fine You Can Glub To The Content Of Your Collapsing And Expanding Bladder Based Aquatic Vascular System
4228
If It Means You Are Excited About Something
4228
Ok Why
4228
It Looks Like One Of Your Letters Got Away From You
4228
You Forked An Innocent D Loitering Over There By The Shout Pole Minding Its Own Business
4228
Yeah Sure
4228
I Thought So
4228
I Have Been Cloaked In A Mood Of Perpetual Anticipation For Some Time As Well
4228
Well
4228
Not Really
4228
What Notes Would You Like To Submit For Comparison
4228
Yeah
4228
I Dont Know For A Fact That She Is Mine
4228
I Know
4228
But What If I Dont Really Want Her To Be That
4228
Yeah Glub Glub Shrug Is The Right Attitude I Think
4228
Our Minds Are Already Made Up Anyway Arent They
4228
They Dont Tell Me Everything
4228
Just As I Am Sure She Doesnt Whisper Everything To You
4228
I Wonder If Any Other Kid On The Planet Has As Many Burdens In The Fire As You
4228
I Doubt It
4241
Just Wanted To Know
4241
Is Your Lusus Dead Yet
4243
Who
4243
Overstating Our Relationship Wont Make Me Feel Very Cooperative
4243
Its Paler Red Than That Ok
4243
Why Do I Got To
4243
I Dont Got To And Every Time You Take My Help For Granted I Feel Like I Got To A Little Less
4243
If Your Slander Werent So Predictable Id Block You Too For Saying That
4243
Has It Occurred To You She May Have Blocked You Because You Are Vvery Ovverbearing
4243
I Just Said That Aloud Now In Your Silly Accent And Had A Private Moment Of Enjoyment
4243
Your Black Solicitation Just Seems Really Indecent
4243
What Do You Want From Her Anyway
4243
What Is It
4243
Can You Just For A Moment Entertain The Thoughts Of One Untouched By Megalomaniacal Derangement And Tell Me Why Id Want To Assist You With That
4243
Also Speculate For A Moment That Self Preservation Might Not Be What Would Sway My Decision
4243
Its Just
4243
Laborious Listening To This
4243
Im Sorry
4243
None Of It Matters
4243
I Know
4243
But You Really Should Know By Now The World Will End Tonight Regardless
4243
Land And Sea Dwellers Alike Will All Die
4243
Because Of The Game We Are About To Play
4243
And I Agree The Fate Of The Race Is Important But Its In My Hands Now
4243
All Of Ours Really
4243
Really
4243
The Doomsday Scenario In Particular
4243
No Not Exactly
4243
I Have Another Source
4243
No
4243
You Arent Actually On The Same Team
4243
No Thats Not It
4243
Its Unbelievable
4243
Her Patience
4243
Never Mind
4243
Something About Longing To Touch You Indiscretely
4243
And That Shes Basically In The Scarlet Throes For You
4243
As Deep In The Flushed Quadrant As One Can Be
4243
To The Letter
4243
Absolutely Not
4243
Yeah
4243
Shes Just A Concerned Moirail
4243
Looking Out For You
4243
Thats All
4243
What Do You Mean
4243
Oh
4243
Hmm
4243
What
4256
Just Presenting A Floating Reminder That Tavros Will Need Plenty Of Inclined Surfaces For His Ascent
4256
Hes Reported Otherwise
4256
Maybe I Should Upend This Load Gaper Over Your Head
4256
Im Still Learning The Interface
4256
It Could Happen Accidentally At Any Moment
4256
Think Of Another Way To Help
4256
Ok
4256
Hmm
4256
I Thought I Was
4467
I Dont Think We Did Anything Special
4467
Last 12th
4467
We Stayed In
4467
And I Read Stories To Her It Was Nice
4467
Yeah I Know
4467
I Wasnt Sure If I Was Going To
4467
But Then I Noticed A Conversation In Which I Was A Participant
4467
Which As It Turns Out Is The Conversation Taking Place Now
4467
I Scanned It Briefly And Then Perused Other Memos For My Presence
4467
I Found None And Returned To This One
4467
But My Part Of The Conversation Was Gone
4467
I Regarded This As A Prompt To Begin Typing And Record My Contributions Live
4467
That Is How This Works Isnt It
4467
What Exactly Happened
4467
No
4467
Alright
4467
In A Moment
4467
It Seems Like A Logical Way To Engineer A System Wherein One Simultaneously Functions As The Reader And Author Of The Transcripts
4467
Its Temporally Sound Construction
4467
I Think We Are Given Roles To Challenge Us
4467
That Dont Necessarily Suit Our Strengths
4467
At Least I Was
4467
I Have No Idea What Im Doing Here
4467
Oh
4467
At This Point Im Not Even Sure If Im Inclined To Ask Anymore
4467
Um
4467
There Is A Good Way To Go I Think Yeah
4467
Its Such A Silly Question
4467
What
4467
Thats Not What This Is About
4467
Im Not Sure What To Say About It
4467
Not Really
4467
If I Were Thinking About It I Probably Wouldnt Have Wanted To Anyway
4467
Dont You Think Its Better To Have Unrehearsed Conversations
4467
Even If The Subject Matter Is Awkward
4467
Ok
4467
Red Then
4467
But I Guess
4467
Not Really Red Enough
4467
Its Not The Asking I Mind
4467
Its The Telling
4467
In A Public Forum
4467
No
4467
It Appeared To Be Just The Two Of Us
4467
I Dont Know Whether Thats Reassuring
4467
Or Just A Bit Disheartening
4467
Disinterest Is The Operative Concept Here
4467
Shes Not Even Responding To My Messages Anymore
4467
Could Be Busy
4467
But Im Rapidly Approaching A Resolution To Discard The Preposterous Infatuation
4467
Shit
4467
How About
4467
If I Agree To Consult With You About It In Private
4467
We Can Drop It Here
4467
Before You Crack Me Like A Vault
4467
With Your Weird Romance Sleuthing Acumen
4467
It Still Puzzles Me That You Are So Versed In The Topic
4467
Do You Have Access To A Manual Archived On A Remote Server Somewhere
4467
That Figure Of Speech You Keep Using Puzzles Me Too
4467
Im Not Qualified To Say
4467
Neither Romance Nor Psychology Are My Strong Suits
4467
And What Of Scarlet Ambitions
4467
Fare Any Better In That Quadrant
4467
Oh Fine
4467
Heres This Silly Question For You
4467
I Was Just Wondering Given Your Vantage Of Hindsight
4467
If Youd Had Cause To Observe At Any Point In Time
4467
Magic
4467
Like Real Magic
4467
I Guess What Im Asking Is
4467
Is Magic A Real Thing
4467
I Know
4467
Its Just That I Have A Good Reason To Believe Magic Is Real
4467
Our Ancient Predecessors Discovered How To Use It
4467
But Then They May Have Surpassed Us In Skill By A Great Deal
4467
Sure
4467
Heh
4467
Im Running Out Of Ideas
4467
I Need To Figure Out A Way To Stoke This Volcano
4467
In Case You And The Others Are Successful In Recovering The Queens Ring
4467
I Guess You Would Know
4467
Still Baffled By What Would Conceivably Cause Such A Crisis In Awesomeness Post-Victory
4467
No
4467
Say Hi To Me For Myself
4467
You Mean Future Me
4467
What
4467
What Did I Do
4467
What Happened
4467
Shithive Maggots You Mean
4467
Til Then
4592
Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
4592
But Actually
4592
There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
4592
And Somehow
4592
Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
4592
And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
4592
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
4592
Okay Sorry
4592
Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
4592
That I Read Your Instructional Guide
4594
Your Speech Was Really
4594
Emotional
4594
I Dont Mean To Critique Your Speech
4594
I Just Wanted To Ask You Something In Confidence
4594
About The Humans
4594
Are You Sure Theyre Responsible For Our Misfortune
4594
Was It On Account Of Malice Or Incompetence
4594
It Sort Of Does
4594
Im Not Even That Sure Why
4594
This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
4594
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
4594
Will Your Response Involve An Athletic Maneuver Of Some Sort
4594
Um
4594
What
4594
Really
4594
Weird
4594
It Is Pretty Disheartening
4594
But
4594
You Are Absolutely Sure They Are All Failures
4594
And That They Have No Chance Of Succeeding
4594
Im Not Sure Which Depresses Me More
4594
The Sabotage Of Our Session Or The Futility Of Theirs
4594
Well I Havent Asked What I Wanted To Ask
4594
Its About TentacleTherapist
4594
You Have Notes On Them
4594
I Guess
4594
Thats Why Youre Our Leader Karkat
4594
Statements Like That Are Also Why Youre Our Leader
4594
Have You Talked To Her
4594
The Rose Human
4594
Also
4594
Do We Really Have To Say Things Like The Rose Human
4594
Uh Okay
4594
It Just
4594
Feels Really Silly When We Say Things Like The John Human In Confidence Amongst Ourselves
4594
The Speech Has Become Emblazoned On My Think Pan
4594
Virtually Ensconced In The Fold Of My Personal Mythology
4594
I Dont Know
4594
Im Not Sure If Ive Got It In Me Right Now
4594
Fine
4594
A Report About What
4594
Is There A Metric For That Concept
4594
That Seems Just As Disparaging To Me As It Is To Her
4605
Hello
4605
Allow Me To Make This Simple
4605
I Am A Troll From Another Universe Using A Chat Client Utility Which Is Capable Of Contacting You And Your Friends At Any Point Of Your Lives Which I Choose Up To And Including The Moment Of Your Own Incompetence Fueled Self Destruction
4605
Im Looking For Evidence Of Intelligence In Your Species
4605
A Reason
4605
Any Reason At All Really
4605
To Justify Wasting The Few Precious Remaining Moments Of My Life On You
4605
It Has Fallen On Your Shoulders To Supply Me With That Reason John Human
4605
Go
4605
What Indeed
4605
I Was Just Leaving
4605
No
4605
We Dont Actually Travel Through
4605
Uh
4605
Well
4605
Not All Of Us Do
4605
One Of Us Does Though
4605
Thats Not What We Are Talking About Here And Is Aside From The Point
4605
No
4605
No John You Werent Listening
4605
Damn It
4605
What The Hell
4605
Okay Youre Even Dumber Than The Rose Human Thats Incredible Really
4605
Im A Girl Not A Boy
4605
It Happens
4605
Yes As A Matter Of Fact
4605
If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement
4605
I Just Spoke To Her In The Future
4605
Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression
4605
But Regardless She Said To Paste Something From Our Conversation
4605
To Get You To Understand Whats Going On
4605
I Have Strong Doubts It Will Be Effective But Here Goes
4605
GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works
4605
GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like
4605
TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.
4605
TT: you look kind of like...
4605
TT: howie mandel from little monsters.
4605
TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.
4605
TT: because he was a big goofy adult.
4605
TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.
4605
GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest
4605
TT: no, it's a movie.
4605
TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.
4605
Are You Suggesting
4605
I Was Being Trolled
4605
That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish
4605
Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well
4605
Okay
4605
Suspicions Pitching Once Again Toward The Conclusion That You Are Just Very Stupid
4605
Im Guessing Thats The Human Equivalent Of 12th Perigees Eve
4605
Will Your Adult Human Custodian Forage For Leavings As Ours Do
4605
Your Blocks Mean Nothing But Dont Worry You Wont Hear From Me Again
4621
What
4621
The Hell
4621
Did You Just Do
4621
You Actually Did It
4621
Blew It Up I Mean
4621
I Had Begun To Believe That Was Embellishment
4621
What Is It
4621
Yeah
4621
Really
4622
What Questions Do You Have
4626
Okay This Will Probably Strike You As An Odd Moment For Me To Mention This
4626
But Actually
4626
There Are Not Many Moments Ive Observed On Your Timeline Which Wouldnt Qualify As Odd
4626
And Somehow
4626
Your Idle Moments Seem To Invite Interruption The Least
4626
And This Is A Difficult Topic For Me To Broach
4626
For Reasons That You Probably Wont Understand
4626
Okay Sorry
4626
Ive Just Been Meaning To Say
4626
That I Read Your Instructional Guide
4627
Yeah
4627
Why
4627
Lately
4627
Almost Perpetually
4627
Wow Yeah Kind Of
4627
Also
4627
That One
4627
Actually
4627
At The Time Of Reading It Lent Some Useful Insight
4627
Into The Nature Of The Game I Hadnt Yet Considered
4627
And
4627
The Author I Guess
4627
Uh
4627
By The Way
4627
What Are You Doing Here
4627
Is This Part Of Your Ongoing Investigation
4628
Are These Tactics Really Necessary
4628
I Know
4628
But I Thought Our Methods Earlier Were Effective
4628
In Illuminating The Underpinnings Of The Game
4628
You Ask Some Questions
4628
And I Answer
4628
If I Can
4628
No
4628
Okay
4628
But These Means Presently On Display
4628
Are Making Me A Little Nervous
4628
I Think Its Kind Of A Reckless Use Of
4628
These Forces
4628
Yes
4628
Well
4628
Influence By The Gods From The Furthest Ring
4628
The Communion You Seem To Have Developed With Them I Find Kind Of Troubling
4628
How Exactly Do You Know That
4628
How Much Time Have You Really Spent Sleeping
4628
Since You Began Playing
4628
That Makes Me No Less Nervous
4628
Our Understanding Is That Influence From Doomed Timelines
4628
Though Seemingly Necessary To Advance In The Alpha Reality
4628
Is Generally Inauspicious
4628
Travelers From Such Branches Are Marked For Death
4628
And Though It Was Only An Insubstantial Part Of You Which Traveled
4628
Just Memories I Suppose
4628
Its Still Troubling
4628
Actually
4628
I Havent
4628
I Have Never Visited Derse Or Traveled Beyond The Veil
4628
Prospits Moon Was My Home
4628
For Most Of My Dreaming Life
4628
Yes
4628
Why
4628
Skaia Was Always The Foil For My Curiosity
4628
But It Only Showed Me What I Needed To See
4628
It Very Much Had The Presence Of Something Sentient
4628
And
4628
Benevolent
4628
But Silent
4628
Not Something To Converse With Or Be Instructed By
4628
Or Anything With An Agenda Beyond Which It Knows To Be Manifest Already
4628
Like A Very Clear Mirror
4628
That Has Everything There Is To See Inside It
4628
But Only Some Things Are Visible At Any Given Moment
4628
I Always Trusted It
4628
And I Dont Trust Gods That Would Eschew Its Light
4629
Oh
4629
A While Ago
4629
I Have To Confess That
4629
Ive Been Experiencing Something Like
4629
Impression Whiplash
4629
Since That Time
4629
At First I Thought You Were Foolish And Incompetent
4629
You See Thats What Im Talking About
4629
That Was A Very Snarky Remark That Happened Just Now
4629
Stratified By Your Signature Varieties Of Insincerity Which Cut Through The Literal Meaning Of The Statement Like Colorful Ribbons
4629
And The Net Intent Is Something Maddening To Try To Know
4629
Its Meaning I Think Exists At The Inscrutable Nexus Of Semantic Space Where Humor Chafes Against Soft Malice
4629
A Place Perhaps The Human Mind Occupies More Comfortably I Dont Know
4629
Xenopsychology Isnt My Strong Suit
4629
Or Even A Real Word
4629
Uh Yeah I Know Im Babbling Again
4629
The Point Is Its Not The Type Of Behavior A Very Stupid Person Can Perpetrate
4629
And So My Impression Has Thrashed Around From Conversation To Conversation
4629
And Now
4629
Rather Than Suspecting You Of Incompetence
4629
I Have Begun To Fear Just The Opposite
4629
I Think You Might Be Dangerous
4629
Maybe Not Knowing That Is What Really Bothers Me
4629
Why Dont You Put The Turtle Ruins Down
4629
And Return To Your House
4629
I Have Sketched Some New Outfits For You That I Think Are Nice
4629
We Could Try To Make Them
4629
It Will Be Fun
4629
Urrgh No
4629
Sadly
4629
What If There Isnt A Later
4629
I Mean
4629
There Not Being A Later Might Happen Sooner Than You Think
4629
I Mean
4629
For You Specifically
4629
Okay
4629
This Was Something Else I Wanted To Say
4629
Or Ask About
4629
But Im Afraid My Asking Might Play A Role In The Outcome
4629
And I Dont Know If I Want That
4630
Um
4630
Alright
4630
I Cant See You In The Future
4630
The Viewport Wont Let Me After A Certain Point
4630
Its Black
4630
But Only For You
4630
Not The Others
4630
Several Hours From Now
4630
Do You Know Why This Could Be
4630
Sort Of
4630
But It Remains Ominous
4630
Also Sort Of
4630
Wait
4630
Is That What Im Doing
4630
On Second Thought
4630
Thats Not What I Want To Do
4630
Well
4630
I Hope That Doesnt Happen
4630
But Id Rather Not Get Stuck In That Kind Of Pattern Again
4630
So If You Want To Wreck Turtle Villages And Tear Your Planet Apart On The Counsel Of Dark Gods
4630
Fine With Me I Guess
4630
Ur
4630
Ill Do The Thing You Do When You Dont Say Anything
4630
"..."
4630
What Was Your Question
4630
I Believe Youre Owed Some Compensatory Ignorance
4631
Ive Never Heard Of It
4631
Agreed
4945
Since The Gap Between Your Present Moment And The Implementation Of Your Mystifying Self Destruction Continues To Narrow
4945
This Will Be The Last Conversation In Which I Attempt To Talk You Out Of It Nicely
4945
First Of All Youre Underestimating The Gravity Of A Dream Death
4945
Its A Pretty Serious Thing Okay
4945
And Dream Selves Are Important To A Person In Ways That Arent Always Obvious
4945
I Think Youre Being Frivolous But Thats Not Really The Sentiment Reinforcing The Exoskeleton Of My Argument
4945
Soon You Will Be Blacked Out Of Trollians Viewport
4945
And I Have No Explanation For This
4945
And Neither Do You
4945
So Ill Just Assume The Worst And You Should Too
4945
Ive Seen You Sleep Before
4945
You Are Just
4945
Asleep
4945
On Screen
4945
Peaceful And Harmless And Posing No Threat To Anyone
4945
Unless I Guess You Are Up To Mischief In Your Dreams Which I Cannot Rule Out
4945
Actually Thats Probably What You Do In Your Sleep What Was I Thinking
4945
Uh
4945
What
4945
Right Sorry
4945
Im Saying This Is A Special Case
4945
It Is Foreboding And Disconcerting And You Are Being Reckless
4945
Your Hubris Is Really Astonishing
4945
Easily Twice The Mass Of A Universe I Think
4945
That It Hasnt Collapsed Upon Itself Into A Tiny Lavender Singularity Is The Most Striking Marvel Paradox Space Has Coughed Up Yet
4945
No Please Stop
4945
Humor Wont Deflect My Really Big And Important Tirade Okay
4945
You Are Investing Too Much Confidence In Evil Gods Who Oppose Skaia And Your True Purpose And
4945
I Cant Abide That
4945
And
4945
As Difficult As This Is For Me To Confess
4945
I Think Your Plan Is Very Dangerous
4945
And So Are You
4945
Yes
4945
And
4945
Im Afraid I Am Going To Have To Devote All My Efforts To Stopping You
4945
Im So Glad You Asked
4945
You See
4945
I Have Been Training A Powerful Wizard
4946
Yes Your Shout Pole Is Like A Tower Broadcasting Your Fear Across The Ring And You Are Right To Be Afraid
4946
I Have Commissioned None Other Than The Legendary Prince Of Hope And I Am Teaching Him The Ways Of White Sorcery
4946
I Have Observed Your Methods And You Will Come To The Most Unwelcome Realization That All Of Your Guile And Cunning Has Finally Backfired
4946
This Noble Magician Of Pure Light Will Serve As The Counterpoint To Your Arcane Debauchery
4946
He Will Hunt You Down And Goodness And Hope Will Prevail
4946
Yes Its Much Too Late For That
4947
Oh Yes I Do Believe Securing A Corpse Box Would Be Prudent
4947
Fitted To Dimensions Suited To Your Myriad Of Unassembled Leaky Body Parts In Aggregate
4947
Yes Definitely
4947
Definitely Do That
4947
Wait I Hope That Wasnt Too Emphatic
4947
Maybe At This Point I Should Clarify This Is All A Big Joke
4947
I Was
4947
Okay Great
4947
I Think What I Find Most Challenging About Human Insincerity Based Humor Is The Degree Of Commitment To The Fantasy Which Is Apparently Requisite
4947
I Mean To Say
4947
The Gesture Of Hostility In This Case Was The Joke
4947
I Did In Fact "Train" This Character
4947
I Made Him A Wand To Shut Him Up
4947
He Wouldnt Stop Harassing Me For Your "Secrets"
4947
Hes The One With The Royalty Complex And Speaks With All The Extra Vees And Doubleyous
4947
Okay
4947
Okay I Will
4947
Uh
4947
Yeah That
4947
Is Still Something That I Dont Really Want To Joke About
4947
I Hope That Came Across As A Sincere Statement
5203
Are You Feeling Any More Cooperative In This Timeframe
5203
I See No Of Course Not
5203
Please
5203
I Know You Were Talking To Her Shortly Before
5203
What Did You Say To Her
5203
Wow
5203
I Still Dont Understand The Password Thing
5203
Past You Doesnt Care About Passwords What Happened
5203
Which Is Favorable
5203
Can We Discuss A Serious Issue In A Silly Manner
5203
How Am I Supposed To Know The Password
5203
I Dont Remember That
5203
I Feel Like I Am Trudging Waist Deep Through A Slither Basin Full Of Your Human Surprise Noodles
5203
I Understand This Silliness Is Currently Permissible But Are Serious Questions About The Password Nonsense Permissible As Well
5203
Why Are You Demanding Passwords From Me And Also Apparently Karkat
5203
I Am Not Trying To Do That
5203
When Will I Get The Password
5205
Im Appreciating Our Conversations From This Timeframe More And More
5205
Past You Is Much Less Of A Taskmaster Than Future You Or Pre Blackout Rose
5205
I Mean Post Blackout Rose Is A Lot Less Difficult Insofar As She Is Unavailable
5205
I Guess Youll Find Out Soon
5205
And Then Report It To Me Under Extremely Specific Circumstances
5205
Which Is Good Because I Sure Dont Know
5205
Yes Hmm And That Face Is A Good Response
5205
Your Eyes Are Right To Be Swirled Letters
5205
What Are You Doing
5205
I See
5205
Well I Didnt Actually Tell You To I Was Just Being Informative
5205
Also It Isnt Technically Witch Of Spacey Stuff
5205
I Was A Sylph Not A Witch
5205
I Think Its Sort Of Like A Witch
5205
But More Magical
5205
Yes Im Completely Certain Of That Suddenly
5205
But Regardless I Think Our Roles Are Approximately The Same Since We Are Both Stokers Of The Forge
5205
As Well As Holders Of Breeding Duties
5205
However I Should Clarify That My Earlier Counsel Was Mostly Academic
5205
It Takes Weeks To Do All Of It Properly
5205
You Wont Have Time
5206
Yeah
5206
What Does It Sound Like
5206
Well It Does
5206
But Not Breeding Through Means Typical Of Most Species
5206
It Has A Lot To Do With It
5206
It Is Cloning Equipment Much Like What Is Scattered All Over The Veil
5206
The Same Kind Responsible For Creating All Of Us
5206
I Didnt Mean To Alarm You By Implying You Were Required To Wage A Great Deal Of Personal Procreation Over A Span Of Several Weeks
5206
Though It Should Be Clear That Repopulation Is Among Our Duties As Well In The Long Term
5206
And Ive Gathered That The Cloning Apparatus In The Veil Is Probably Meant To Permit An Initial Boost On The World We Select For Settlement
5206
But Beyond That It Is Up To The Descendants To Perpetuate The Race
5206
And Your Species Has Quite An Advantage In This Respect
5206
Your Procreation May Be Carried Out By Paired Individuals Autonomously
5206
Whereas Ours May Not
5206
Which Is What Makes My Role Particularly Important
5206
Im The Keeper Of The Matriorb
5206
It Is An Egg That Will Hatch A New Mother Grub
5206
She Alone Will Be Responsible For Bearing Our Young
5206
I Guess So
5206
And You Are Like Erect Livestock
5206
Without The Muscle Definition
5206
Or The Hermaphroditic Physiology For That Matter
5206
But Milk Producers Nonetheless
5206
That Rare Kind Of Organism To Nurture Hatchless Young Within
5206
Are You Not
5207
Anyway
5207
I Had Imagined I Would Hatch The New Grub On A Planet In Your Universe
5207
And When That Became Impossible I Quickly Lost Hope
5207
I Assumed It Would Remain Locked In Its Card Forever
5207
Which Could Only Be Opened When The Orb Was Meant To Be Used
5207
But Then I Found Something Quite Unexpected When I Was Exploring This Lab
5207
I Found A Key
5207
It Was Deep In The Meteor
5207
And As I Suspected It Released The Orb
5207
Which Was Really Confusing To Me For A While
5207
Until I Realized What It Meant
5207
Which Is So Obvious Im Amazed I Didnt Think Of It Right Away
5207
It Means I Am Supposed To Use It Now
5207
To Hatch The Grub In The Heart Of This Meteor
5208
Sure
5208
There Is No Reason A Meteor Couldnt Act As The Center Of Our Races Resurrection
5208
They Are Themselves Like Large Seeds After All
5208
The Only Question Is Whether We Can Manage To Keep It From Being Destroyed
5208
As Well As Whether I Am Able To Raise A Mother Grub To Maturity
5208
Oh Wow That Thought Is Actually Pretty Overwhelming
5208
You Do
5208
Yes She Was In Fact A Mother Grub
5208
Who Relinquished Her Calling As Matriarch To Raise Me
5208
Okay
5208
Thanks For Saying So
5209
Its Very Involved
5209
Like I Said You Wont Have Time
5209
In Fact It Probably Should Have Taken Considerably Longer Than It Took Me
5209
I Was A Little Rushed
5209
Yes Youre Right
5209
I Cant Imagine How You Can Complete The Objective In The Time Given
5209
But Weirder Things Have Happened I Think
5209
First Deploy The Pad
5209
Um
5209
Why All The Way Up There
5209
Yes Thats Right
5209
That Will Probably Change If You Light The Forge
5209
But One Thing At A Time I Guess
5211
Thats The Appropriate Size For The Equipment
5211
Babies
5211
What
5211
Yes I Know
5211
I Didnt Mean To Suggest Your Breeding Duties Involved Cloning Humans
5211
Repopulation Is Not Whats Happening Here
5211
Its Not Your Objective As The Witch Of Space
5211
Not Yet Anyway
5211
Frogs
5211
Sorry I Thought That Was Obvious
5212
Yes
5212
What Are You Laughing At There
5212
What Is He Saying
5212
Hmm
5212
Okay Im Laughing Pretty Hard At All That
5212
He Will Need To Deploy The Terminal
5212
Then You Can Start Hunting For Frogs To Appearify From Around Your World
5214
I Would Conjecture That Most Of Them Are
5214
And Will Stay That Way Until The Forge Is Brought To Life
5214
I Think The Event Is Designed To Trigger Drastic Planetary Upheaval Wherever The Forge Is Stationed
5214
It Did On My Planet As Well
5214
No Mostly Water
5214
Yes
5214
It Probably Wont Do Any Good But You Can Try
5215
The Problem Isnt That The Frog Is Still Frozen
5215
The Problem Is That You Were Able To Appearify It At All
5215
Ectobiology Is Based Entirely On Your Inability To Appearify A Subject
5215
If That Frog Were Destined To Do Something Else
5215
Such As Become Ensnared In Your Net Later
5215
You Would Not Be Able To Appearify It Because That Would Cause A Paradox
5215
So Instead You Would Appearify Its Slime Imprint
5215
The Paradox Slime Is What Is Important Here
5215
You Can Mix It With The Slime From Other Paradoxically Appearified Frog Imprints
5215
Study The Genes And Selectively Combine
5215
And Then Create Resulting Paradox Clones
5215
You Will Need To Direct The Terminal To Another Frog
5215
And Then You Must Be Sure Later To Interfere With That Frog In Some Way
5215
For Instance By Planning To Venture Out To Capture That Exact Frog As I Suggested Earlier
5215
That Way It Will Be Impossible To Appearify The Frog Before Your Interference Has Taken Place
5215
Only Its Slime Will Arrive
5215
Yes
5216
Yes That Should Work
5216
Make A Note Of The Coordinates
5216
When You Travel To Interact With Your Cloned Subjects You Are Also Taking The Opportunity To Explore And Discover New Habitats
5216
As Well As New Species Of Frogs For Your Terminal To Track
5216
Its Efficient To Go Adventuring In This Fashion While You Are Waiting For Your Young Clones To Mature
5216
Yes Its A Lot Of Fun
5216
It Is Also Extremely Time Consuming
5216
Unlike Some Appearifiers In The Veil This One Is Locked To The Present Moment
5216
You Cannot Use It As A Window Into The Future Or Past And Isolate Frogs Whose Futures Are Certain And Therefore Most Paradoxifiable
5216
Means Of Expedition Are Limited
5216
I Suppose You Could Use Time Travel To Accelerate The Process
5216
But You Would Need To Establish Weeks Worth Of Stable Time Loops
5216
I Think It Would Be An Overly Elaborate And Dangerous Undertaking Personally And Anyone Who Would Attempt Such A Thing Is Reckless
5216
I Wouldnt Advise It
5217
Youll Need Somewhere To Keep Them While They Grow
5217
Like A Pool Or A Tank Or Such
5217
Or At Least Something Temporary
5217
Water Wasnt Very Hard For Me To Come By But For You I Dont Know
5218
Yes But This Isnt All There Is To The Cloning Process
5218
A True Paradox Clone Is An Exact Genetic Duplicate Of The Subject
5218
Later That Clone Will Be Sent Back In Time To Become Itself
5218
In Fact If It Is An Exact Duplicate This Is Guaranteed To Happen
5218
This Is What Classifies It As A Paradox Clone
5218
Any Duplicate Which Genetically Deviates From The Original Is Not
5218
It Is Simply A Mutant
5218
And For Breeding Purposes Mutation Is Desirable
5218
Within Reason
5218
You May Adjust The Settings On The Equipment To Promote Genetic Anomalies
5218
But Its Very Delicate And You Can Go Too Far
5218
Responsibly Guiding The Evolution Of The Genetic Code During The Breeding Process Is Very Important
5218
In Fact It Is The Most Important Thing About This Of All
5218
Yes
5218
Actually
5218
Yes
5218
Thats Exactly What Youre Doing
5218
Your Objective Is To Breed The Genesis Frog
5219
You Cant Complete The Game Without Doing So
5219
Your Entire Mission Depends On Breeding Him
5219
Yes
5219
He Will Begin As A Tadpole Like You Have There But Considerably Bigger
5219
And He Will Mature To Become The Speaker
5219
A Deity Like Figure Idolized By The Consorts Who Wait For Him To Come
5219
Hes Known As The Speaker Of The Vast Croak
5219
Yes The Croak Really Is Quite Vast And Is Something To Behold
5219
Its The Most Amazing Thing I Have Seen
5219
Yes There Will Be One For Every Session Should The Players Be Successful
5219
And Each One Is A Unique Product Of Their Quest
5219
The Kingdoms Are At Odds Over His Creation
5219
Prospit Worships Him Much As The Consorts Do
5219
Derse Reviles Him And Outlaws Frogs Wherever They Can
5219
Even The Iconography
5219
Their Agents Mock His Name With Slurs
5219
Like Speaker Of The Vast Joke
5219
Or Bilious Slick
5219
Although To Be Honest That Is What We Ended Up Calling Him
5219
Not To Be Disrespectful Though It Was Just A Catchier Name
5219
I Doubt Its Even Possible To Offend Him
5219
Most Certainly
5219
No
5219
Youre Not Really Understanding The Magnitude Of His Role
5219
He Is Not Responsible For Just One Aspect Of The Universe You Create
5219
Hes Responsible For All Of Them
5219
Bilious Slick Is Your Universe
5220
I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From
5220
We Engineered That Incarnation
5220
He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create
5220
Sorry
5220
I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure
5220
Yes Literally
5220
That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be
5220
I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons
5220
Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks
5220
Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose
5220
Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That
5220
Its A Nice Change Of Pace
5220
Oh Its Not Important
5220
Well
5220
Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation
5220
Sort Of
5220
I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be
5220
I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though
5220
It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her
5220
I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess
5220
She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent
5220
And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me
5220
You Are More Sensible
5220
Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You
5220
Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit
5220
Like Me
5220
If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This
5220
I Woke Up A Long Time Ago
5220
I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young
5220
The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess
5220
My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help
5220
And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert
5220
Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White
5220
He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit
5220
Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since
5220
He Said He Was My Guardian
5220
And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That
5220
Then Later He Stopped Coming
5220
In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind
5220
Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It
5220
But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real
5220
He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party
5220
And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes
5220
It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy
5220
Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements
5220
But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great
5220
I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me
5220
And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People
5220
Youre Right We Do
5220
I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role
5220
It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By
5220
To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It
5220
I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems
5220
Yes Definitely
5220
We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems
5220
I Believe She Is Yours
5220
And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough
5220
She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned
5220
And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations
5220
Yes
5220
And Hes Not Merely A Guardian
5220
Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian
5220
Like Your Lusus Was
5220
I Feel The Same Way About It
5220
The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious
5220
Even When Seemingly Benign
5220
She Was
5220
Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon
5220
After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me
5220
In The Meantime I Will Go
5220
I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb
5220
It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now
5220
Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can
5220
The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together
5220
Ill Message You Again In Your Future
5220
And You May Reply If You Have Cause To
5220
Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords
5220
Yes You
5220
You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me
5220
Thats A Reasonable Attitude
5220
Okay
5220
Ten
5220
Im Counting Eleven
5220
The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality
5220
Oh
5220
Wow Yeah
5220
I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity
5220
Oh No
5220
Yeah I Know
5220
Yes Ill Do That
5220
Bye Jade
5254
WHAT THE FUCK?
5254
WHO ARE YOU, AND WHY ARE YOU MESSAGING ME THROUGH KANAYA'S ACCOUNT?
5254
I SERIOUSLY DON'T NEED THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW.
5496
Oh Really
5496
This Is A Dream Isnt It
5496
It Seemed Obvious
5496
Either Im Sleeping Or Im Dead Which Is It
5496
My New Self
5496
You Mean
5496
Being A Ghost And Then A Frog And Then A Robot And Then A Fairy
5496
Kind Of
5496
What Do You Mean We Have Been Groomed
5496
Okay
5496
What Do I Do
5496
Was What We Were Attempting Before Not Old Fashioned
5496
It Seems To Me The Nature Of The Afterlife Is Probably Very Old Fashioned
5496
Maybe Even The Most Old Fashioned A Thing Can Get
5496
Yes Then
5496
This Was When You Were About To Give Me That Unusual Gift From The Ruins
5497
Yeah Im Still Not Sure Aradia Are We Supposed To Be Role Playing
5497
Hi Jade
5497
Uh
5497
What Is That Thing Youre Wearing
5497
No I Didnt Mean To Sound Disapproving
5497
But I Do Think More Colorful Apparel Suits You Better
5497
I Did
5497
About What
5497
Whats A Vampire
5498
There Isnt Much To Say
5498
I Repaired The Doll And Made Him A Nice Outfit
5498
With A Far More Becoming Palette And Fit Than The Absurd Tatters He Was Found In
5498
I Thought At Least
5498
Uh
5498
Should There Be Anything Else To This Story
5498
Anyway That Is All I Can Remember
5498
I Quickly Began To Find The Doll Unnerving So I Put Him Away
5498
To My Knowledge He Has Remained Secure In My Block Ever Since
5498
Is He Relevant In Some Way
5498
Yes Aradia It Seems You Have Some Foreknowledge Of This Narrative Maybe You Can Tell Us Why Any Of This Is Important
5876
Derse Agents Are Heavily Predisposed Toward The Murder And Desecration Of Amphibious Lifeforms And Their Iconography Respectively
5876
Frequently I Had To Thwart Assassination Attempts From Their Kingdom
5876
Or Extermination Attempts Is Probably Better To Say
5876
Bad Dog
5876
Worst Enemy
5877
I Recommended She Return To Her Denizen For Advice
5877
The Location Of The Final Frog Required To Complete The Gene Sequence
5877
One Whose Song Should Remove The Last Traces Of Dissonance From The Waveform
5877
The Creature Is Quite Elusive Remember
5877
Yes
5877
I Had A Good Lead
5877
But You Decided There Was Not Enough Time Left To Bother With It
5877
Understood But This Was A Matter That Really Did Require Your Attention
5878
Yes I Know The Team Is Falling Apart And Everything
5878
But Doing This Was Your Duty Too
5878
And After A Point Of Critical Complication There Is Only So Much Responsibility You Can Take For The Actions Of Your Team
5878
The Future
5878
Um
5878
Okay Im A Vampire Now Apparently If That Helps
5878
They Arent Trashy
5878
That Sounds Like A Stupid Movie
5878
Yes Staying Would Be Better
5878
Trust Me That This Was And Still Is A Very Important Thing For You To Have Done And Still Do
5878
Maybe Even The Most Important
5879
What Were Her Terms You Never Did Tell Me
5879
Oh
5879
I Just Thought It Wasnt That Important Or Interesting
5879
Since Karkat Thought The Battle Was More Pressing Than To Wait For Me To Locate Another Frog
5879
Also
5879
What She Asked Me To Do Was Impossible
5879
So
5879
Yeah
5885
Yes Ive Inferred Their Ultimata Are All Personalized Variations On The Presentation Of Such Dilemmas
5885
What Were Her Demands
5926
Sollux Is Okay
5926
Hes With Me Right Now
5926
Hold On I Really Need To Change These Clothes
6250
Actually I Was Just Thinking
6250
Its Nice To Get A Little Sun After So Long
6250
One Moment
6254
Okay Then What Do We Do
6255
I See
6255
Then Perhaps We Should Reserve The Infinite Darkness Plan For The Maybe Column For Now
6255
I Think Im Even Willing To Let Dave Take A Crack At The Logistics Before We Commit To That Particular Maneuver Daring Though It Sounds
6255
Yes Im Willing To Humor Elaboration On This Rap Centric Plan And Its Apathy Based Contingencies
6255
Even If Its Excessively Stupid
6256
So
6256
You Arent Coming Then
6256
Maybe I Will Stay Here Too
6256
As Nice As It Sounds To Move On
6256
I Dont Know If I Can Stand Three Of Your Human Years Of More Darkness
6256
I Like This Sun Its Comforting In A Strange Way
6256
Like Home
6256
What Could I Possibly Do
6256
Aside From Providing A Light Source As You Navigate The Dim Corridors
6256
I Would Function As A Premium Escort To The Load Gaper And Thats About It
6256
What Are You Talking About
6256
What Real Hope Is There For That
6256
The Orb Was Destroyed
6256
I Was Never Able To Duplicate It The Grist Cost Was Astronomical
6256
Doesnt Rose Know
6256
Cant You See The Path To Victory On This Matter
6256
I Would Like To Have The Orb Again And To Keep It Safe This Time
6256
And I Guess To Not Be A Total Failure
6256
...
6256
Well
6256
All Right
6256
But Must We Really Leave So Soon
6256
Wait Another Visitor
6256
Who
6257
He Took Them
6257
Look At The Trails
6257
Im Pretty Sure He Kisses Them Too Sometimes
6258
Clown Hunting
6259
...
6597
No
6597
Have You Seen Gamzee
6597
Yeah
6597
I Know
6597
I Wouldnt Expect Him To
6597
I Wouldnt Even Ask It Would Be Really Bad Form To Ask Him That
6597
Okay
6597
Hmm
6597
Im Being Cool About It
6597
Its Not Like That
6597
I Just Want To Find Him
6597
And
6597
At Least Wound Him Somewhat
6597
No
6597
See Im Explaining This Badly
6597
All Im Saying Is Basically
6597
Just
6597
Fuck That Guy
6599
No Thank You
6601
I Really Wouldnt Rule It Out
6608
What Are You People Even Talking About
6608
I Feel As Though This Conversation Has Utterly Outmaneuvered My Constructive Involvement
6608
Im Going To Go
6609
Augh
6609
Why Does That Always Happen
6889
(Whats Liquor)
6889
(What Are We Talking About Here)
6889
(Oh A Soporific Human Substance)
6889
(Got It)
6889
(I Honestly Have No Idea Whats Going On So I Came Over Here To See If You Knew)
7306
Good Evening
7306
Oh
7306
Hmm
7306
Am I
7306
Underdressed For The Occasion
7306
If Id Known You Wanted To Dress In More Elegant Attire I Would Have Happily Uh
7306
Hmmm
7306
Well
7306
If Um
7306
You Think Im Fine Like This Then Okay
7306
Rose
7306
Are You Feeling Alright
7306
Ah
7306
It Seems You May Have Imbibed One Of Your Experimental Human Soporifics
7306
Whoah
7306
Yes
7306
Well Then
7306
I Guess That Would Explain It
7306
The Lethargy You Possibly Experienced When It Came To Completing Our Rendezvous In A Timely Manner
7306
I Was Waiting For You In The Common Area For A Couple Hours But You Did Not Show Up
7306
So
7306
I Came To Find You
7308
Our Date
7308
Then
7308
You Did Intend For The Plans We Made To Be A Date
7308
Which Is To Say One That Was Romantically Oriented
7308
Well
7308
Im Still Amenable To An Evening Of
7308
Whatever
7308
But
7308
Is There Some Reason Why You Would Advise Otherwise Dave
7308
I Will Have To Plead Ignorance On The Subject Of Human Courtship And Its Customs When It Involves One Or More Intoxicated Participants
7308
Is There A Problem
7308
...
7308
Alright
7308
Yes
7308
After You
7308
If You Can Actually
7308
Manage To
7308
Whoa There!
7308
Maintain Your Balance
7308
Okay
7308
Are You Good
7308
Okay Good
7308
Lets Go
7309
Since Its Now Clear That Your Premeditated Designs On This Evening Exceeded My Own By A Wide Margin
7309
Insofar As You Intended This To Be A Date With Fancy Clothes Whereas I Showed Up Looking Like Something The Lusus Dragged In
7309
Maybe You Can Tell Me Now Exactly What You Had In Mind
7309
I Mean
7309
As Far As Specific Activities Are Concerned
7309
Noupe
7309
I Mean Nope
7309
Nope What
7309
Its Really Okay Though
7309
I Admit I Was Irked For A Moment But Then Realized It Was So Unlike You That Extenuating Circumstances Were Most Likely In Play
7309
So I Went To Find You And Lo And Behold
7309
Extenuation Was What I Found To Be Taking Place
7309
What
7309
No Hear What
7310
That Better
7310
(what are we listening for)
7310
Yes That Sounds Nice
7312
Yes
7313
And What
7313
!!!
7313
You Did
7313
Where??
7313
Actually
7313
Theres No Need To Worry About That
7313
I Think Im Done Trying To Kill Him
7313
Yeah
7313
He Has Achieved Victory Through The Gambit Of Cowards Default
7313
Dont Get Me Wrong He Is Still Utterly Awful
7313
But Sometimes You Just Have To Let A Thing Go
7313
You Know
7313
What Were You Saying About Terezi And Gamzee
7313
What
7313
Are You Serious
7313
Why
7313
That Could Be Very Awkward Yes
7314
Me Too
7314
I Can See The Dilemma Here
7314
Are You Actually Thinking About
7314
Um
7314
Doing Something About This
7314
I Understand
7314
But What Youre Describing Is
7314
Hmm
7314
Actually Im Hesitant To Even Mention It
7314
This Is Probably Not A Good Idea
7314
The Feelings You Are Having Are Actually Perfectly Normal Within The Framework Of Our Quadrant Based Romantic Tradition
7314
I Dont Know If They Can Be Felt Naturally By Humans But The Way You Are Viewing Their Relationship Would Be Quite A Standard Response On Alternia
7314
Yes
7314
It Is Sanctioned Within The Ashen Quadrant
7314
Which Addresses Conciliatory Romantic Feelings Not Directed At A Single Person
7314
But At Two People Who Are Presently In Such A Contentious Relationship
7314
It Is Generally Not Regarded As One Of The More Emotionally Fulfilling Quadrants To Become Involved In
7314
And Can Be Quite Laborious To Maintain
7314
But It Served A Very Important Social Purpose For My People
7314
Such As In Situations Very Similar To The One You Described
7314
Where Two Parties Are Highly Drawn To Each Other Through Animosity
7314
They May In Fact Be Perfect For Each Other In That Tumultuous Quadrant
7314
But To Pursue The Relationship Would Be Chaos
7314
Much Like The Scenario You Laid Out The Two Kismeses If Left Unchecked Would Devastate All Their Other Relationships
7314
Those In Their Own Quadrants And Even Those In Other Peoples
7314
So It Is The Job Of An Auspistice To Make Sure That Doesnt Happen
7315
Oh No
7315
Really
7315
I Dont Think I Would Advise It
7315
Its Extremely Difficult And Can Often Feel Like A Thankless Undertaking
7315
In Truth It Is Probably The Most Challenging Quadrant To Master
7315
Trust Me
7315
I
7315
...
7315
I Really
7315
Dont Know If I Would Be A Good Teacher
7315
Of Auspisticism
7315
I Honestly Was Not Very Good At It Myself
7315
Everything
7316
That Is
7316
A Lot Of Things
7955
...
7955
...
7955
...
7955
...
7955
...
7956
Rose You Are Willfully Ignoring My Trail Of Finish Crumbs
7956
I Said Them Quietly In Sequence To Convey One Of Your Human Pregnant Pauses Before Speaking
7956
The Pause Was Human Expecting In The Same Sense That I Am Expecting An Explanation For Your Present Conduct
7956
We Were To Meet The Others On The Roof By Now
7956
Im Trying To Toll... To Tell You That We Are On The Verge Of Reaching Our Destination And Here I Find You Doing
7956
What Are You Doing Exactly
7956
What
7956
!
7956
You Have Been Drinking Your Soporifics In Excess Again
7956
Rose This Is Terrible
7956
No But
7956
Really What Are You Doing Here In The Tiny Simulated Village
7956
Are You
7956
Are You Writing Numbers On All Of These Nutrition Cylinders
7956
Yes
7956
You Have Mentioned This
7956
Tallcircles
7956
Tallcircles No That Sucks
7956
Answer My Question Please Why Are You Numbering The Tallcirc...
7956
CANS
7956
You Want To Relocate The City
7956
Now??
7956
This Is Such A Foolish Use Of Your Time
7957
I Think The Torch Is Not All You Have Managed To Keep Lit
7957
......
7957
So Many Finish Crumbs Up In Here
7957
You Said Some Of Those Words Two Or Three Times And Most Of Them Werent Words
7958
I Do Not Believe This
7958
You Promised Me You Would Be Ready For Our Arrival
7958
This Is Not Ready!
7958
When I Said Ready I Believe Your Sobriety Was More Than Implied As The Operative Criterion
7958
Ugh!
7958
I Have Been As Polite As I Can Be But Honestly Your Demeanor Is Not Nearly As Charming As You Appear To Believe When You Have Consumed A Lot Of That Liquid
7958
You Have Assured Me That Chronic And Habitual Exploitation Of This Substance Is "Not A Problem" For Your People But At This Point I Must Conclude That You Were Just Lying!
7958
Why
7958
Why Did You Do This Just Before Our Arrival When You Told Me You Wouldnt!!!
7958
But You Cant Help Us Like This!
7958
We Need You!
7958
Youre The Smartest One On This Meteor!
7958
By Quite A Lot!
7958
What
7958
Okay That Was Literally The Most Inebriated Thing You Have Ever Said
7959
You Are Not Actually Suggesting This Simple Creature Dressed In Rags Is Your Intellectual Superior
7959
How Would One Even Draw This Conclusion
7959
He Does Not Speak
7959
He Does Not Have His Ways He Likes Cans And Little Pretend Cities And He Is Rather Adorable And That Is Pretty Much All There Is To Say About The Mayor
7959
Please Do Not Distract From Important Issues With Talk Of Fake Mayors
7959
This Is Not A Hypothetical Exercise In Your Earth Psychiatrics!
7959
You Made A Promise To Me And You Did Not Keep It!
7959
Yes You Are Usually Very Smart And We All Need You But More Importantly I Need You!
7959
Dont You Remember!
7959
You Said You Would Help Me Resurrect My Species!
7959
I Still Dont Know How Im Going To Acquire A New Matriorb!
7959
How Are We Supposed To Solve That Problem When Your Think Pan Is Addled So!
7959
That Is Not Reassuring Coming From You Like This!
7959
I Often Cant Tell Even At Your Most Lucid If You Put Too Much Trust In Your Seering Abilities
7959
But When You Say Such Things While Obscured By These Toxins You Sound Outright Delusional!
7959
You Stumble Around This Lab In Such High Spirits Which Makes It Impossible To Broach The Subject From A Standpoint Of Mutual Agreement That Your Behavior Is A Problem!
7959
ARGH YOU SEE
7959
No Not Exactly
7959
I Have Already Explained
7959
You Have Severely Hobbled Your Intellect And Your Efficacy
7959
The Objectives You Prioritize Have Become Ridiculous
7959
You Have Just Now Decided To Draw A Map Of A False Metropolis!
7959
Others Have Suffered As Well
7959
What Ever Happened To Your Concern For Terezi And Gamzee
7959
Were All My Lessons In Auspisticism For Nothing??
7959
I Know Its Hard!
7959
Its Supposed To Be Hard!!
7959
And My Name Is Not Kakaka!!!
7959
You Cannot Say It!
7959
Because You Are!
7959
HUMAN DRUNK!!!!!!!!!!
7959
Raaararraauuuaaaauuaghghgghgggghhgh!
7964
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8126
(hisssss...)
8181
Whos We
8181
Of Course Not
8181
But If Youre Referring To The Short Term Memory Loss We All Seem To Be Experiencing Yes Ive Got That Too
8181
How Do You Know Im On Lofaf
8181
I Didnt Think Karkat Could Remember The Acronyms For Your Planets
8181
Okay
8181
Shes Apparently On Lolar
8181
Shes With Rose
8181
No
8181
But It Seems Theyve Both Surmised The Missing Events Since We Arrived
8181
Well They Are Seers After All
8181
Im A Sylph!!!
8181
I Am On Record As Once Having Facetiously Likened It To A Magical Witch
8181
If Its Any Reassurance You Seem Like The Same Old Dave To Me
8181
I Dont Know
8181
Rose Was Trying To Tell Me But She Ceased Being Comprehensible
8181
No
8181
Its Just That Her Words Suddenly Became
8181
Why Dont You Just Talk To Her And See For Yourself
8181
I Know Right
8227
(You Do Realize I Spoke To Jade Plenty Of Times Myself)
8227
No
8227
I Second Your Motion
8228
Um
8228
So
8228
No?
8229
How Do You Figure
8229
I Think You Are Presuming To Know A Lot About My Nature Which Is Not Actually True
8229
It Sounds As Though Youre Suggesting That I Have Qualities Similar To Certain Types Of Shadow Droppers Which Is Not Quite The Case But Even If It Was There Are A Lot Of Myths About Shadow Dropper Physiology That Are Commonly Perpetuated By Popular...
8298
Why Would You Do That!
8298
I Do Not Understand Why You Needed To Impale My Friend To Demonstrate Your Resurrection Abilities!
8298
I Believed You!
8298
It Was Pointless And Cruel And Does Not Advance My Willingness To Cooperate With You At All!
8298
Furthermore It Did Not Prove That You Can Use Said Abilities To Harm Me!
8298
I Believe That Assertion Was Based On A Fallacious Theory About My Constitution!
8298
