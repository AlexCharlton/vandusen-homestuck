2342
you see not everybody always means the opposite of what they say the way you and dave always do
2342

2342
i finally finished a present for him
2342
ive been working on it for years!!!!
2342

err.......
2342
no :(
2342
sorry but you are sort of hard shop for <_<

2342
ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?

yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!
2342
i just thought you might find it interesting
2342

dave is cool, you know he will come around when the time is right
2738
he just has a lot of work to do first
2738
and so do you!
2738
youll need to keep searching for a stable signal and power source, it will be hard but dont give up!!!
2738
and dont worry about me either, focus on playing with john first
2738
it all starts with you two!
2738
haha dark? thats ridiculous!
2738
i dont really know what to tell you other than its not going to be what you think it is
2738
and most importantly you will have your questions answered, but they will be the ones you havent thought to ask yet!
2738
just be patient and be brave youll see
2738
it will be fun!!!!!!
2738

2900
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
2900
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
2900
i have counted twelve
2900
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
2900
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
2900
but i think they are mostly harmless
2900
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe

you should go there and get your copy of the server and set up with me.....

3291
but you dont know it yet
3291

3291
i wont have to be so coy with you anymore because im pretty sure most of the stuff that was supposed to happen has already happened
3291

...
3405
duuurrrrr dave i was going to build some stairs up there durrrrrhhhhhh
3405
gosh i dont know i guess i didnt find the time to make them because i keep getting punched in the face by robots and stuff!!!!!!!
3405
;p
3405
i dont know!
3405
nope....
3405
what was it doing up here?
3407
i think your sprite wants to hatch it!
3407
awww
3407
hmm...
3407
i dont know it looks like its pretty warm where you are
3407
maybe not too long then????
3407
i guess we'll find out!
3407
:(
3410
ok some of these things we can deploy but some things we dont have nearly enough grist for!
3410
no no weve got enough for that.....
3410
but its still pretty expensive
3410
yeah me too!
3410
and we have 2000 to work with
3410
ok 1998 ._.
3410
ohhh...
3410
how much did rose start with? when she was playing with john?
3410
k
3410
i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection!
3410
no!!!!
3410
i cant buy the holopad thingy and the intellibeam laserstation
3410
hahahaha no theyre right here!
3410
they cost a fortune
3410
yeah ive got that too!
3410
i will deploy it
3410
yes i think that is how it works
3410
when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!
3411
i suppose just hang on to them for a while........
3411
and then later
3411
just do whatever you are naturally compelled to do with them!
3425
yay thank you john!!!!! :D
3425
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that!
3425
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!!
3425
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait!
3425
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does!
3425
<3......
3425
uhhhh hold on
3425
what do you want?????
3425
this is nonsense
3425
every time i believe something you say you laugh at me and call me a gullible human!!!!
3425
its so childish
3425
D:
3425
i dont know what youre talking about at all.....
3425
its another prank
3425
no
3425
you mean the robot you think is stupid?
3425
the one youve mocked me for having on a number of occasions???
3425
this is the worst prank youve ever pulled!!!!!!
3425
why should i do that?
3425
ok im back sorry
3425
i had to tell someone to go away!
3425
yup :o
3425
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
3425
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
3425
i have counted twelve
3425
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
3425
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
3425
but i think they are mostly harmless
3425
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe
3463
dave here punch this code!
3463
L229BxoG
3463
and then put it in the jumper shunty thing and see what it does
3464
well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features....
3464
hang on ill give you more codes!!!
3527
hehehe......
3527
yeah i bet hes right!
3527
wow no i dont think so...
3527
hes being a bit more literal than that!
3527
what did he say?
3527
:)
3527
well what he meant was.....
3527
that you have a dream self
3527
who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep
3527
we all do! all four of us i mean
3527
but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep
3527
because you havent woken up yet!
3527
yes
3527
no you would not be out of line!
3527
in fact im asleep now
3527
:p
3527
no only i can do that!
3527
because of my robot
3527
you guys can probably make your own i guess......
3527
but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!!
3527
um.......
3527
ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming!
3527
shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless
3527
about things burdening her
3527
which is to say you!!!!!
3527
things about who you really are and what your purpose is
3527
but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet
3527
thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!
3527
im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious
3527
or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?
3527

3530

3553
yeah hes pretty tied up right now!
3553
noooooooooooooooooooo
3553
he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep!
3553
but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(
3836
ummmmmm.....
3836
oh! yes it appears so!!!
3836
i guess! ive been pretty busy here
3836
ive had to stay asleep for a long time because john is supposed to wake up soon
3836

3836
im pretty sure im supposed to be the one to wake him but i dont know what to do :(
3836

3836
hmmmmm
3836
you could ask me in the future!
3836
is he not a nice guy?
3836
hmmm....
3836
well maybe hes just been through some tough times
3836
maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt?
3836
for whatever its worth i think youre a pretty nice guy too!
3836
also you seem to be the only one who ever thinks to talk to me while im asleep!
3836
why is that?
3836
oh no!!!
3836
dream selves can die?
3836
i never knew that
3836
or even thought about it....
3836
i guess it makes sense though
4750

4750

4750

4750
my head hurts

4750
oh god....
4750
prospit :(
4750

4750

4750

4750
argh
4750
sorry but
4750

4750

4750
i can hardly read what you type and its giving me a migraine
4750
what about the -E thing, can you stop that too? it is also annoying and stupid
4750
meh :\
4750
hehehe
4750
ok, sorry for sounding bossy
4750
you seem pretty nice, and you sure do look exotic
4750
i kind of always thought you were all like
4750
a bunch of really obnoxious humans
4750
hey feferi, i would like to remember......
4750
but everything is so foggy right now
4750
i remember prospit being attacked
4750
and
4750
falling.....
4750
aaaand
4750
i dunno :(
4750
do you know what happened?
4750
fffffff
4750
yeah, i gathered that! XC
4750
ohhhhhhh!!!!!
4750
i do remember you!
4750
i remember you were talking to me about my lusus, and i had no idea what you were talking about
4750
and still sort of dont :\
4750
but you must mean bec
4750
also it was shortly before your friend sent me a weird message
4750
about how my robot was going to explode, and i should talk to him when it happens
4750
this was months ago
4750
it was the most awful and angry one
4750
i am so sick of him, i really dont want to talk to that pathetic jerk ever
4750
thats his name?
4750
hmmmm
4750
thats right, it was about some kind of plan...
4750
which he said me from the future told him about?
4750
i thought it was total nonsense at the time
4750
but
4750
i guess he was telling the truth
4750
so maybe i should talk to him? i dont know
4750
ewwwww
4750
ewwwwwwwwwwww!
4750
fish aliens are weird
4750
ok feferi, it was nice talking to you
4750
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4750
i am never going to sleep again!
4750
never never never never never never
4750
yes, im so tired
4750
:(
4750
well, ok
4750
bye
4751
ok, my robot exploded
4751
now what smart guy!
4751
i knew i would regret this
4751
talking to you is so terrible
4751
its making my headache worse
4751
uuuugh shut uuuuup!
4751
will you just tell me what you wanted?
4751
i cant believe i fell for this
4751
it was just a setup to troll me some more
4751
why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it
4751
thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word
4751
and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!
4751
you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont
4751
aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!
4751
i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me
4751
and that is really really shitty!!!!!!
4751
i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever
4751
bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!
4751
yes
4751
as if my day needed another reason to get worse
4751
what does that mean!
4751
is this another prank
4751
you are seriously the worst at pranks
4751
:|
4768
john are you there???
4768
yes!
4768
im so relieved to talk to you and hear youre ok
4768
i mean.......
4768
are you ok john? your dream self i mean
4768
:(
4768
yes, but that was not prospit. that was its moon which was severed by the crazy derse agent
4768
i dunno!
4768
really?? :D
4768
<3
4768
i dont know! i did not give him one after applying the upgrades
4768
i gave her a girls name when i was very young, but now she is a different bunny, and also a boy i guess?
4768
its up to you john, he is your bunny
4768
hahahaha
4768
again?
4768
you were at roses house??
4768
what!!!!
4768
ugh he is so weird
4768
you shouldnt listen to him!
4768
D:
4768
he is angry and a huge pain in the ass
4768
have you ever talked to two of him at once????
4768
dont ever do it! you will get a headache
4768
noooooooo, think again
4768
????
4768
:|
4768
you mean from armageddon?
4768
john that is so stupid
4768
but also kind of cute i guess
4768
ok then the bunny will be named after your silly movie star fantasy crush
4768
yeah......
4768
that reminds me john
4768
have you looked in the lab yet?
4768
the big room in the sphere at the top of the tower
4768
could you do me a favor and not look in there?
4768
its nothing that secret or personal or anything....
4768
it is just something kind of sad and weird for you to see
4768
it is my dead dream self
4768
it has been there for years, i always knew i would die but i did not realize it would go like this....
4768
what?
4768
oh no!!!!!
4768
im sorry john :(
4768
i understand
4768
ummmmmmm
4768
i think i would rather not talk about that either
4768
you did????
4768
oh nooooooo
4768
john that ring is really important, it belongs to the white queen!
4768
when you go to sleep again, you should try to find it and keep it safe!
4768
yes i have seen it, it is so huge ._.
4768
how much time do you suppose we have?
4780
hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is
4780
but they usually do!
4780
yes, youre right
4780
i dont know...
4780
there are so many possibilities
4780
hmmmmmm!
4780
yes, it sure seems that way
4780
well
4780
maybe you will get that chance john
4780
yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance!
4780
i once dreamt that we would
4780
sure, why not!
4780
that is what i believe this game is for in part
4780
you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave...
4780
dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members
4780
wait, he did????
4780
that is
4780
soooo cooooool :O
4780
i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!!
4780
i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him
4780
we probably have so much to catch up on
4780
i dont see him in his house either :(
4780
oh, ok...
4780
jeez, i feel so out of the loop :(
4780
yes! ok here i go
4780
what!
4780
augh, nooooooooooooooo
4780
oh god, dont get me started :|
4780
he was a strange and silly man
4780
hmmmmmmm, perhaps
4780
is that allowed?
4780
yes, thats a good idea
4787
it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted
4787
he called it the typheus minion
4787
i always hated it!
4787
i guess so
4787
it is probably a coincidence though
4787
yeah maybe.....
4787
i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster
4787
well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with!
4787
:p!!!!!!
4787
joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy
4787
YEAH RIGHT
4787
now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better....
4787
but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer
4787
after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P
4787
maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine!
4787
oh???
4787
:O
4787
omg
4787
john that is incredible
4787
i cant wait to make stuff like that!!!!!!
4787
except...
4787
all my awesome stuff exploded with my room :(
4787
yay!!!
4790
what is the problem!!!!
4790
yes
4790
nice!
4790
how much time?
4790
D:
4790
john, try to be more careful!
4790
um.....
4790
what?
4807
dave!
4807
are you busy?
4807
i dont have much time!
4807
i am about to make my entry item, and its a little confusing
4807
i think the more players we add, the trickier they are to... um......
4807
activate!
4807
like yours was
4807
i figured we could brainstorm about it, while john fusses with the kernel
4807
helloooooo?
4807
:o
4807
:\
4807
whaaat....?
4807
dammit dave!!!!!!
4807
this is really urgent!
4807
._.
4891
oh.............
4891
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
4891
but youre a troll
4891
and thats what trolls do!
4891
even when they say they wont
4891
sometimes especially!!!!!!
4891
ok.....
4891
even though i still have no idea what youre talking about
4891
whats a lusus!!!!!
4891
:\
4891

4891
i dont understand
4891

4891
i dont know... im sure i remember you said that
4891
oh
4891
yeah it is
4891
i dont know what i was thinking....
4891
i just had a major case of deja vu!
4891

4891

4891

4891
its not going away :o
4892
ummm
4892
what do you mean i never explained it to you?
4892
if this really is the first time we talked, why would i have?
4892
XO
4892
feferi that one was a stretch even by your fish punnery standards
4892
aaah why do i know that you like to make fish puns???
4892
actually
4892
i do remember this conversation
4892
it was in the past!
4892
but if it was in the past, then where am i now?
4892
so what is going on?
4892
i dont think i am asleep....
4892

4892

4892

4924
im so horribly unprepared for this.... i have never even seen snow before, can you believe that!!!
4924
derp yes dave that is so where i lived
4924
that is as biographically accurate as it gets about me!
4924
no???
4924
isnt it great?????
4924
lava is NOT better than snow :|
4924
you cant play in lava, its no fun
4924
you can only die in lava
4924
eww dave no
4924
no this is so lame
4924
i am hearing an insane and stupid guy say stupid idiot things while wearing dumb sunglasses for lame morons!
4924
heheheh
4924
why dont we play in the snow later
4924
as soon as you get some....................................
4924
..............................
4924
...................
4924
..........
4924
...............
4924
.......
4924
....
4924
...
4924
..
4924
.
4924
time 8)
4924
i know youre joking around, you are not too cool at all, you dont even think that
4924
brrrrrr
4924
i forgot :\
4924
i cant!!!
4924
all that stuff blew up
4924
its a long story that involves a pinata and a gun and a very naughty doggie
4924
so anyway, that reminds me ive got to talk to john!
4924
ive got to get him to make me some new gizmos...
4924
assuming thats even possible
4925
john has magic cyclone powers?
4925
whoa....
4925
you guys are all so much better than me, i feel sooooo lame
4925
heehee
4925
maaaybe
4925
:)
4925
oh no
4925
did he lose it in a magic cyclone?
4925
we do?
4925
doing what??
4925
yes
4925
oh jeez, a few hours????
4925
fastest hours :o
4925
but that costs so much grist!!!
4925
omg...
4926
what does this thing do?
4926
on the back of cards?
4926
but
4926
we can already read those!
4926
hmm
4926
but isnt the whole point of captchas that only humans can read them?
4926
and not robots???
4927
anti spam?
4927
yeah obviously!
4927
oh nooo
4927
whats the good news?
4927
dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here
4928
oh....
4928
to give it to john?
4928
but...
4928
you are already roses server player!
4928
and john is mine!
4928
not to mention im yours!!!
4928
can you really be a server player to your own server player?
4928
but i guess
4928
i thought that john sort of.....
4928
HAD to be my server? you know?
4929
well youre from the future right?
4929
dont you know already if itll work?
4929
pretty smooth dave
4929
shades for everybody
4929
8) 8)
4930
so you will be the server for BOTH us ladies???
4930
you just keep getting smoother, i cant handle all this smoothness
4930
ohh...
4930
i guess that makes sense
4930
ok i think i understand that!
4930
yessss thanks dave <3
4930
um
4930
what do you mean rose will check out? :\
4930
uhhhh ok
4931
it does doesnt it
4931
how long?
4931
ok thats not THAT long :p
4932
yaaaaaaaaaaaay!
4949
oh hi!
4949
i remember you, you talked to me a lot in my dreams
4949
yup!
4949
thats because my dream self died
4949
pretty catastrophically!
4949
thanks, but i think im ok
4949
i felt pretty shaken up at first though
4949
yeah i have done a lot of sleeping myself :)
4949
wow why did you sleep so much???
4949
oh no what happened that was so terrible?
4949
ok sorry for prying!
4949
what did you want to talk about?
4949
permission for what?
4949
with bec?
4949
uh....
4949
what do you mean by commune?
4949
and
4949
what do you mean the first time!
4949
you did it before?
4949
ohhh
4949
like a psychic power??
4949
pretty sweet!
4949
when did you do it before?
4951
hehe what?
4955
omg......
4955
that wasnt a senior interloper, im pretty sure youre talking about my grandpa!!!
4955
and if im interpreting correctly....
4955
youre saying you used bec to make me shoot him???
4955
augh thats so awful!
4955
oh boy
4955
ok it is basically an old man, who serves the same role as i guess a lusus does on your planet?
4955
he was like my dad, he took care of me!
4955
sigh...
4955
well im not blaming you or anything
4955
it sounds like you were just trying to help
4955
and you did save my life
4955
but......
4955
i mean jeeeez
4955
talk about a misunderstanding
4955
uh
4955
sure?
4955
.... it is?
4955
oh nooo
4955
how did that happen?
4955
:|
4955
ummm what kind of device?
4955
oh you mean a wheelchair!
4955
how...
4955
did that happen?
4955
D:
4955
im so sorry
4955
um also
4955
i didnt realize you were paralyzed
4955
not that im saying sorry for that! that would be rude i think
4955
i am just saying sorry for your loss
4955
oh?
4955
wow nice!
4955
um
4955
that.....
4955
i dont know if i agree with that!
4955
well
4955
thats good i guess
4955
i just wish...
4955
maybe you'd told me what happened when i was younger?
4955
i spent years wondering about it!
4955
when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it
4955
and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!!
4955
she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time
4955
but of course i got older and realized that was silly, but then i just speculated that maybe it was suicide
4955
which was just a really sad thing to think about!!!
4955
buuuut...
4955
even if you do, i dont remember you doing so!
4955
er
4955
ok :\
4955
.......
4956
woooooow...
4956
you sound really confused to me!
4956
heheheh
4956
youre incredibly silly
4956
i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here!
4956
rufio?
4956
what do you mean fake?
4956
ohh like an imaginary friend....
4956
heh, ok
4956
that
4956
sure is a philosophy you have there!
4956
oh??
4956
well, what is it?
4956
yes
4956
sure!
4956
red feelings?
4956
you mean
4956
whoooooaaaaaa
4956
wait
4956
really? :o
4956
um.................
4956
well
4956
i dont think i can reciprocate!
4956
i mean
4956
youre nice
4956
but i dont really know you...
4956
i dont even know your name!
4956
ok tavros
4956
i dont know if youve fully thought about this!
4956
you dont actually know me very well either
4956
well no
4956
i was being nice
4956
because
4956
i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me
4956
but......
4956
things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations!
4956
i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming...
4956
i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real
4956
dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit?
4956
sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you...
4956
but i dont know what else to say
4956
jeeeeeez, um...
4956
tavros i am really flattered you like me and all
4956
and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut...
4956
i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess?
4956
i aaaalso think...
4956
and really this is just polite friendly advice!
4956
that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time
4956
it...
4956
oh man im sorry to say
4956
it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose!
4956
and all things considered i think we should just stay friends
4956
or really........
4956
continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well!
4956
sorry :C
4956
aaaah no! you should have self respect
4956
just...
4956
oh boy this is frustrating
4956
can we talk about this later?
4956
i have some things to do!
4956
why dont we get back to the original point
4956
why do you want to commune with bec again?
4957
uh-ohhh
4957
what is your idea this time?
4957
wow, i dunno about that!
4957
but hes my best friend!!!
4957
and you have already managed to get one of my family members killed
4957
but all of our adversaries have inherited his powers!
4957
i would imagine the strongest guy would have all of his powers, and then some!!!
4957
i am really not comfortable with this
4957
you said you are asking me permission first and i appreciate that
4957
but if you are asking im afraid my answer is no!
4957
what?
4957
no way!
4957
that would be smug and arrogant and would make you a bully!!!
4957
later if my friends and i want to ask bec for help and decide thats our best hope, then thats our business
4957
until then, just please stop meddling!!!!!!
4957
nooooooooo dont dont dont dont dont
4957
im serious
4957
uuuuggghh i think my headache is coming back
4957
no...
4957
its fine
4957
i just really dont want you to do that ok?
4957
i have to go now
4957
bye tavros
5041
it is the prettiest tree i have ever seen!!!!!
5041
ok great!
5041
everything about that makes total sense
5041
ok
5042
is this conksucky enough
5042
<3
5042
well...
5042
i am not even sure if i am technically a u.s. citizen!
5075
which one were you again?
5075
wait
5075
werent you the guy who was always trying to hit on me??
5075
uh...
5075
but
5075
im the wwitch!
5075
i mean witch
5075
rose?
5075
i do not have a score to settle with rose!!!
5075
why would you think that?
5075
i think you are projecting your own attitude on to others
5075
just because you tend to hate and/or hit on everyone you meet doesnt mean everyone else is that way
5075
rose just sent me a code for a crystal ball, shes my friend and is basically the best!
5075
wait do you have a thing for her too???
5075
did she reject you or something?
5075
:|
5075
uh huh...
5075
wow what are you talking about
5075
hey look at that, time for me to get going!
5075
no i dont want it!!!!!
5075
more like a legendary piece of shit!
5075
yes but i dont like you very much and i feel really icky about accepting a present from you
5075
siiigh
5075
fine
5075
what?
5075
oh...
5076
hmmm...
5076
i have seen this before
5076
i am very sure its the same rifle included with johns present
5076
but...
5076
bigger of course
5076
yes but....
5076
i did not provide the weapons!
5076
my penpal did
5076
the guy who helps me build the present
5076
we worked on it together but he supplied the bunnys weapons
5076
im pretty sure hes from the future!
5076
because he said hes my grandson
5076
umm yes
5076
oh no!!!!!
5076
aaaaa please dont tell anyone i told you about him!
5076
augh how could i let that slip to you of all people
5076
wow ok!!!!
5076
i wasnt going to say anything
5076
he didnt want me to tell my friends who he really was
5076
i guess maybe he was concerned about upsetting the timeline? i dunno
5076
maybe!
5076
i have wondered about that, assuming he is right...
5076
he was so nice, and it really did feel like i was talking to family, so i really dont think he was making it up
5076
i couldnt help but try to imagine his parents...
5076
and more interestingly.......
5076
his grandfather :O
5076
i still wonder who it could be...
5076
although i guess at this point
5076
the options are pretty limited :o
5076
like an heirloom? i guess it could be
5076
do you even have those? if you dont have parents how could you?
5076
ewwwwwwww
5076
hmmmm
5076
then maybe that is how this heirloom should work
5076
well i dont want to use it!
5076
so ill just dump it outside the house with the trash
5076
and if it is fated to find my penpal one day then so be it!
5076
maybe you should have been nicer to me!
5076
in any case i dont appreciate the spirit in which the gift was given so this is what i will do!
5104
dave!!!!!!
5104
any dave out there please listen!
5104
dave i just saw you, and you were dead!
5104
you were in a green suit and covered in blood, oh god it was terrible :(
5104
if that was a future dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!!
5104
oh
5104
i am confused :o
5104
ok...
5104
i am still not sure i get that!
5104
but i guess i am relieved?
5104
wheeeew! there i just was
5104
how did that poor dave die?
5104
was it jack?
5104
D:
5104
what about your...
5104
um....
5104
oh no i dont even know if you know about this
5104
;_;
5104
is it something you would like to talk about
5104
ghost dad???
5104
oh...
5104
yes he mentioned something about it
5104
i guess i didnt realize its full implications....
5104
but time was short when we talked!
5104
ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him
5104
its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D:
5104
anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad
5104
you were pretty close with him right?
5104
heheh
5104
sure
5104
dave we have to stop him!!!!!
5104
jack!
5104
he shouldnt get away with this
5104
yes
5104
why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??
5104
oh :(
5104
what is the scratch?
5104
really??
5104
hmmmm...
5104
so was that like a hint?
5104
about what im supposed to do :D
5104
well maybe im just being naive...
5104
but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!
5104
are you suuuure we cant beat him?
5104
i dont know if we should rule it out!
5104
ok
5104
thanks dave!
5106
hey tavros!
5106
i was thinking about your plan
5106
about uh...
5106
"communing" with my lusus :)
5106
maybe its not a bad idea!
5106
are you there?
5106
hmm, i guess you are off doing something else
5106
oh well, hope youre doing ok....
5106
talk to you later!
5113
hello!
5113
ummmmmm
5113
jade?
5113

5113
oh good!
5113
hehehe, i was starting to get worried there
5140
uuugh
5140
what happened?
5140
oh god
5140
oh no oh god.....
5140
what did i dooooo
5141
um... jade?
5141
what is the matter?
5141
why are you so sad?
5141
i prototyped you and brought you back!
5141
should i not have?
5141
oh no, it is?
5141
:(
5141
thats terrible, im really sorry
5141
i guess i did not think this through
5141
i dont think...
5141
that it can be undone :(
5141
:o
5142
well...
5142
now i dont know what to do
5142
i really messed up, i feel so bad
5142
where would you go?
5142
but you cant!
5142
i mean, not just yet, please?
5142
i know you are upset jade
5142
but i did sort of bring you back for a reason
5142
we need your help!
5142
well, all of us here
5142
me and dave and rose and john
5142
D:
5142
what is it now!
5142
what do you mean, how could you forget about john???
5142
but john didnt die!
5142
i saved him
5142
YOU saved him, dont you remember?
5142
you pushed him out of the way of prospits moon at the last minute, and hes ok now!!!
5142
oh nooo jade please dont
5142
:C
5143
:(
5143
i know jade i was there too...
5143
these are both our memories!
5143
jade, pleeease...
5143
stop...
5143
you are going to make me cry too, stop it!!!
5143
*sob*
5143
PFFheheh... *sob* hehehehehehe
5144
you want me to help you...
5144
die again?
5144
wow...
5144
ok, i know this is my fault
5144
but that is a really hard thing to ask me to do!
5144
even if it was possible the way you are now
5144
i dont think i could go through with it :(
5144
ok ok shhhhh...
5144
jade listen
5144
i never did tell you why i brought you back
5144
and it may be that
5144
if you attempt what i wanted you to do in the first place
5144
god i cant believe im saying this...
5144
but you might end up getting what you want anyway
5144
because it was always going to be risky
5144
well, you remember the guy who destroyed prospit?
5144
shh!!!
5144
anyway, he is the reason i brought you here
5144
he has the same powers you have, making him unbeatable to us...
5144
but maybe not you!
5144
so you could go find him and
5144
um
5144
i just thought
5144
as long as youre here
5144
but
5144
i thought you wanted to die?
5144
you wouldnt go even if he could...
5144
jeez...
5144
youre right, i really dont
5144
i said SHH!
5144
wow
5144
jade...
5144
i dont mean to be insensitive but
5144
there is a lot at stake here!
5144
i... pfhehe, dont change the subject!
5144
i mean, dont you remember what this was all about?
5144
what you were working for... what WE were working for all those years before you died?
5144
remember what we saw in the clouds, or what the queen told us?
5144
how could you not remember john survived?
5144
we both saw him in a cloud! he was in his dream suit and awake, reading our letter!
5144
didnt you think about that?
5144
...
5144
what!!!!!
5144
how can you SAY that?
5144
JOHN DIDNT DIE!!!
5144
omg...
5144
this is so frustrating, i just told you he didnt
5144
i knew i was kind of ditzy and forgetful in my dreams, but
5144
SHHHHH! okaaaaaay, jeez!
5144
i just dont know what to think
5144
i guess you are part of me, and you are who i was when i slept
5144
but it makes me sad to think i would act like this
5144
i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right!
5144
yes you do!
5144
even though you dont want to be, youre here now, and there are still people who need you
5144
there is still something worth fighting for!
5145
that is a horrible thing to say!
5145
AUGH!
5145
that is SO SELFISH!!!
5145
i cant believe this
5145
how can you say these things, dont you remember anything that the queen told us?
5145
that we would eventually build a new world and make a future together with our friends?
5145
dont you remember being excited about finding out what that meant?
5145
yes it will!!!
5145
some of us, the ones who still have hope, are fighting for that RIGHT NOW
5145
how can you have such a negative outlook on absolutely everything?
5145
shut up!!!!!!
5145
stop being such a damn crybaby!
5145
really, we both had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCES. and look, i am managing to keep my head up, see?
5145
you dont even have the full picture either, because you checked out early!
5145
you didnt have to stand by as bec gave jack his powers when you might have been able to stop that
5145
and you didnt have to watch as jack became so strong he could appear anywhere and kill anyone you loved at any moment!
5145
you didnt have to see a dave lying in his own blood :(
5145
no, see...
5145
HEY! no. youre not allowed to cry about that because you DIDNT SEE IT
5145
thats the whole point!!!
5145
you are just looking for any excuse you can to be sad and useless and its starting to piss me off!
5145
no
5145
NO. BAD.
5145
NO, FOR GODS SAKE WILL YOU SHUT UP AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY
5146
I SAID PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER YOU BLUBBERING GODDAMN PANSY
5146
JUST SHUT UP. DRY YOUR CRYBABY EYES, STOP BEING A COWARD, AND GO FIGHT JACK NOIR!!!!!!!!!!!!
5147
SHUT UP
5147
NO
5147
JUST
5147
GOD DAMN IT
5147
PLEASE
5147
JUST ONCE
5147
SHUT THE HELL UP
5147
SHUT UP
5147
SHUT
5147
THE
5147
FUCK
5147
UP
5150
karkat!!!!!
5150
yes
5150
im going crazy here
5150
i never thought id say this, but im actually almost relieved to talk to you
5150
or really ANYBODY besides that lunatic
5150
SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!!
5150
are you joking??? look at this mess!
5150
okay...
5150
i made the mistake of prototyping my dream self who has been dead for years
5150
and shes completely crazy and theres no talking any sense into her
5150
hmm?
5150
hmm what
5151
:\
5151
what are you getting at???
5151
well...
5151
i mean, i understand why she is upset
5151
but she is completely inconsolable, and wont listen to reason about anything!
5151
and i guess i could deal with that but...
5151
the frustrating thing is that shes actually me :(
5151
i really dont think i would act like that
5151
will you stop saying hmm!!!!!!
5151
fascination?
5151
what do you find so fascinating?
5151
my feelings?
5151
well...
5151
at first i was sad
5151
because she made me remember all the sad things that just happened
5151
but im trying to be strong about all that so we can keep moving forward
5151
and if i can then why cant she?
5151
but she just went on and on
5151
and i started getting angry...
5151
ugh i have never been so angry in my LIFE!!!
5151
I SAID STOP SAYING FUCKING HMM
5151
what does THAT mean?????
5151
is that supposed to be someone with a halo and goofy teeth?
5151
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?
5151
oh
5151
haha oops
5151
yeah, pretty much
5151
considering what??
5151
oh come on...
5151
this is NOTHING like that!
5151
because she's...
5151
well
5151
she's ACTUALLY INSANE
5151
but
5151
those are you
5151
im not her!
5151
i dont know
5151
it just...
5151
...
5151
oh my god
5151
youre right :(
5152
so then i guess
5152
im a hypocrite :(
5152
wait...
5152
so me arguing with my dead dream self
5152
and smacking her around while screaming at her
5152
makes me SANE???
5152
hahaha, wow
5152
you are so weird
5152
you want me to apologize?!
5152
for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself???
5152
after taking so much crap from you for all those years?
5152
no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT
5152
shut uuuup!!!
5152
what
5152
are you saying you want to apologize
5152
ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again!
5152
maybe your "present self" should own up to it!
5152
laaaaame
5152
hahahaha, that is so ridiculous
5152
why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally?
5152
:o
5152
hmmmm...
5152
yes, hm
5152
ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me
5152
and youre right, i dont actually know you
5152
i just know the part of you who acted like a bully
5152
i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry
5152
so i will accept your apology and give you another chance
5152
and i will apologize for calling you crazy
5152
obviously i am not in much position to judge :|
5152
so you say you have been talking to me from the future?
5152
ok, so what is the plan?
5152
i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly?
5152
yes
5153
ok, i can do that
5153
but why, what does it do?
5153
its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out
5153
i dont think im following...
5153
you were told?
5153
by who?
5153
oh...
5153
future me?
5153
uh... ok
5153
well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me!
5153
hey!!!
5153
oh yeah! dave told me about that.
5153
what is it?
5153
ok then...
5153
what was the thing i told you to tell me to do?
5153
right now, i mean
5153
ok
5153
then what
5153
draw it?
5153
and then?
5203
password!
5203
I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!!
5203
whoops sorry
5203
ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p
5203
well......
5203
it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation?
5203
both are!
5203
but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be
5203
so we can have one right now if you want
5203
in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already!
5203
but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........
5203
PASSWORD :P
5203
nope!
5203
because i told you
5203
exactly!!!!!!!!!!!
5203
hehehe
5203
yum :B ??????????????????????
5203
hmm, i suppose those are acceptable
5203
to keep the conversations linear!
5203
i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation
5203
you have to give me that password to start our next conversation
5203
this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now!
5203
i know, but trust me its better this way :)
5203
i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from!
5203
but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation
5203
and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since!
5203
bye kanaya <3
5205
thanks i think!
5205
what do you mean by pre blackout rose?
5205
umm, ok...
5205
but what do you mean by blackout???
5205
hmm @_@
5205
im doing what you told me to do!
5205
im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment
5205
so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about
5205
which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :(
5205
oh
5205
what is a sylph?
5205
a magical witch???
5205
thats awesome
5205
breeding duties?????
5206
uhhhhhhhhh...
5206
please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like!
5206
it sounds like
5206
it involves
5206
a lot of breeding :\
5206
oh
5206
does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it?
5206
ok then, thats pretty neat
5206
yeah, whew <_<;
5206
how so?
5206
what is your role?
5206
whoa, cool!
5206
so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns
5206
:o
5206
errr.......
5206
yes 8|
5207
what!
5208
you think so?
5208
i think you can do it!
5208
yes...
5208
didnt you say your lusus was a grub?
5208
thats perfect!
5208
if you were raised by a mother grub, then you are in a great position to raise one yourself
5208
it is like...
5208
a sort of family legacy!
5208
a really cool alien family legacy
5209
dont mention it!
5209
so how does this cloning stuff work?
5209
i want to try anyway!
5209
if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left
5209
yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower
5209
didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place?
5209
my house is freezing now
5209
it ran on geothermal power before...
5209
and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet
5209
yes i would like to hear about that later...
5209
but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium!
5209
lets see how dave is doing.....
5211
its...
5211
so small :o
5211
but
5211
clone babies can barely even fit on that thing!
5211
i mean young humans!!!
5211
you know, that we milk producers nurture hatchless within?
5211
then what is the objective?
5211
what am i breeding????
5211
:O
5212
i cant get over how tiny this thing is!
5212
its so cute
5212
so the baby frogs show up on this pad here?
5212
i cant wait to try it
5212
oh
5212
lol
5212
dave just has a lot of funny stuff to say about all this
5212
oh you know, a bunch of silly stuff
5212
theres too much to copy/paste!
5212
here ill save it all to a file and send it to you
5212
hahaha
5212
alright how do i get started!
5214
ok, here is a frog on the screen
5214
on no, is it trapped in ice?
5214
was your planet covered in ice too?
5214
cool!
5214
anyway, i will try to rescue this frog
5214
so i push this button to appearify it?
5214
ok........
5215
oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!!
5215
this will not do
5215
i dont understand!
5215
but i am intrigued...
5215
ok, that makes sense i think
5215
how can i appearify some frog slime?
5215
so it is like
5215
a sort of backwards frog breeding
5215
clone first, catch later?
5216
ok, i will try this
5216
heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky
5216
he looks frozen solid too
5216
so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???
5216
that sounds like fun!!!!!!!
5216
hmmmmm
5216
k hang on while i clone this fella.....
5217
yaaaaaay!!!
5217
i will think of something...
5217
i wont let the poor little guy suffocate!
5218
so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones?
5218
it is?
5218
huh...
5218
so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?
5218
am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?
5218
sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O
5218
oh!
5219
why?
5219
him?
5219
so he is a boy frog?
5219
the speaker?
5219
hehehe
5219
CROOOOOOAK
5219
then the speaker is like a god, but there are a lot of them?
5219
like one for each session, kind of like the kings and queens?
5219
it is pretty catchy...
5219
if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense!
5219
thats good
5219
ok then what?
5219
what do we do after i make this big god froggy?
5219
does it have something to do with the new universe we create?
5219
you said he was a genesis frog
5219
does that mean we bring him into the universe and...
5219
he makes new planets or life or such?
5220
really???
5220
yes i got that!
5220
you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?
5220
but your species is too!
5220
especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic
5220
but i dont do that!
5220
i try to say what i mean as much as i can
5220
from what?
5220
haha, you mean from rose?
5220
yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!
5220
they inculcate that stuff like crazy
5220
so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?
5220
are you best friends now??
5220
why?
5220
oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?
5220
what the heck does that mean!
5220
yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!
5220
you did???????
5220
yeah! :D
5220
jeez, i hope not...
5220
me too!!!!!
5220
wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common
5220
well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature
5220
i can understand that
5220
are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?
5220
you mean your guardian?
5220
uh oh...
5220
im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous
5220
she didnt mention anything about this when we talked
5220
but then she seemed preoccupied
5220
yeah, i will!
5220
lol yeah i guess so!
5220
ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...
5220
theres still so much i want to know!
5220
i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!
5220
yes! <3
5220
if i have cause to?
5220
oh!!!
5220
that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear
5220
yeah! i guess someone told you?
5220
aaaaa you see??????
5220
you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!
5220
i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...
5220
i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from
5220
ok lets put the system in play starting now!
5220
i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again
5220
the password is...............
5220
CROOOOOOOOOOOAK
5220
it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!
5220
whoops!
5220
eleven then :p
5220
kanaya :o
5220
that sounded
5220
just a weeeeeee bit
5220
sarcastic ;D
5220
you are just becoming multicultural, thats all
5220
i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well
5220
it mostly involves saying fuck a lot
5220
heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad
5220
ok! go hatch that orb!
5220
i will be waiting
5220
later!
5315
john!!! :D
5315
wow, finally!
5315
nope!
5315
dave was able to set up as my server player
5315
he is building up my house right now so that we can deploy some equipment up there
5315
yep!
5315
:o
5315
thats ok, i wont tell him about it
5315
well, maybe you can.....
5315
i will try to put in a good word for you B)
5315
im not sure!
5315
something to do with cloning i guess? it serves some purpose in my quest as witch of space
5315
a nice troll named kanaya has been advising me on stuff about that
5315
have you talked to her?
5315
you should!
5315
a bunch of trolls are not nearly as bad as i thought
5315
even karkat! he has been helping me too... sort of, hehe
5315
oh yeah, he said plenty of stuff like that, but i dont think he ever actually meant it
5315
flying off the handle is part is of his charm in a funny way, once you know that about him
5315
heheheh
5315
shhhhhhhhh
5315
yeah!
5315
hmm what else... theres been so much going on, its been a little hard to keep track of it all!
5315
why dont you tell me what youve been up to first?
5315
..............
5315
whoa :O
5315
john where did you get that nice flying car??????
5316
sort of!
5316
she gave me the code, and i made a cool pair of goggles with it
5316
it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car
5316
and your chauffeur familiar, i guess?
5316
you did???
5316
:(
5316
hmmmmm...
5316
maybe, but hang on let me try something
5316
yes!
5316
what have you seen?
5316
:O
5316
like what, what did you seeeee?
5316
frogs?
5316
no...
5316
sure does!
5316
nope! but that sounds pretty interesting
5316
i wonder why i would be surrounded by frogs?
5316
hahaha thats true!
5316
i hope i am not planning on putting them in a cauldron or anything o_o
5316
whew!
5316
bluh. yes :|
5316
i prototyped my dead dream self and tried to get her to fight jack
5316
but it turned out to be a BIG MISTAKE
5316
god i cant believe how dumb that idea was, she was an emotional wreck
5316
oh, she went off to cry somewhere else... good riddance!
5316
hehe i guess so
5316
what!!!!!
5317
oh noooo
5317
who?
5317
i dont think so!
5317
well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree
5317
what process?
5317
and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused
5317
ohhhhhh!
5317
that makes sense
5317
dave had mentioned you reached the god tier
5317
but he did not say what it involved D:
5317
he probably didnt want to make me worried
5317
or that!
5317
but he also said that no one else would do it but you...
5317
actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead
5317
its too bad really
5317
i wonder what space powers would be like??
5317
oh well
5317
!!!
5317
youre right...
5317
i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :(
5317
DX
5317
i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly.
5317
why dont you tell me about your new friend?
5317
he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
5318
haha! what is he doing with that!
5318
probably!
5318
you are just going to have to deal with the fact that you are becoming a famous hero john, and people everywhere will idolize you
5318
:o
5318
thats great! john you have to get that ring from him!
5318
hmmmmmmmmmm
5318
that is a problem!
5318
you do?
5318
and what?
5318
8O
5318
ok john.....
5318
i trust you
5318
so i will trust in your trust in him
5318
im going to be a supportive piece of shit all day and fall down all this trust!
5318
lol
5318
john, i already found your dad!
5319
yes i found him with my goggles almost right away!
5319
but i didnt want to interrupt you
5319
he is with roses mom
5319
they are in a castle, having some sort of tea party together
5319
they appear to be enjoying each others company!
5319
its quite adorable actually
5319
RED ALERT!!!!!!
5319
AWOOOOOOOOOOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5319
durrrr oh really john :p
5319
but really, they make a nice couple and i think it would be great if they got married!
5319
i guess so
5319
yes they are pretty special
5319
i dunno
5319
who are they to stand between two youngsters in love?
5319
yes john, two people must be in love in order to get married
5319
it is one of the rules!
5319
so what do you say john, are you in love with rose?
5319
and if not, are you prepared to fall in love with her?
5319
wellllll? :D
5319
i didnt even know karkat made a shipping diagram...
5319
i will have to make him show me
5319
<_<;
5319
whaaat...
5319
i dont know about that!
5319
i clearly need to take a good hard look at this prophetic document
5319
and possibly tell karkat what an idiot he is!
5319
uh
5319
well, i dont actually know where he is relative to you!
5319
so i dont know if i can give you directions
5319
there might be some way to do that...
5319
these goggles are actually REALLY COMPLICATED!
5319
i will look into it and get back to you
5319
in the meantime, why dont you fly around and keep looking?
5319
at least now you know to look for a castle
5319
and maybe the clouds will give you some more tips!
5319
sure! <3
5319
later!
5492
ummmmmm hey guys i hope im not interrupting!!!
5493
oh no!
5493
i can leave
5493
:o
5493
its ok! i can take another nap later when you guys arent busy...
5493
well...
5493
i have just been enjoying these little naps more and more lately!
5493
each time i go to sleep i meet more new people and learn so much
5493
but i still cant get karkat to take a nap, boy talk about a guy who is anti nap!
5493
seeeeeriously!
5493
he is the douchiest of crabby crabs who ever douched a big douchey crab
5493
but yeah, its been fun, i should really thank feferi again for setting it up so we could meet like this!
5493
yup!
5493
ummm probably in another bubble
5493
but youll find her! maybe during your next nap...
5493
yeah!
5493
you were really nice and helpful
5493
i think your outfit looks so cute! i love your wings too
5493
i am not sure :o
5493
what!
5495
i am ready!
5496
yay!
5497
wait! before we do...
5497
hi kanaya! it is nice to meet you
5497
you dont like it???
5497
yes i know you told me!
5497
yes but you probably havent yet
5497
not from your perspective..... i could not help but overhear you are asleep now
5497
you told me all about what happened after you woke up!
5497
about how you turned into a vampire
5498
isnt that daves puppet?
5498
:\
5498
bye!
5498
guys why do you have daves puppet?
5498
what is going on here!
5536
rose jeez!!!
5536
finally
5536
you sure seem to be absorbed in whatever youre doing on that computer...
5536
were you talking to someone?
5536
oh no no i dont blame you for not responding!
5536
you must be very upset
5536
are you ok?
5536
um
5536
because
5536
uhhh i figured you would have found out by now but i guess you still dont know?
5536
about...
5536
johns dad
5536
and.......
5536
your mom :(
5536
rose?
5536
hello???
5536
oh noo :'(
5538
rose please say something
5538
you are making me nervous...
5538
umm
5538
because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation?
5538
i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it
5538
john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!
5538
and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?
5538
i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...
5538
argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(
5538
whew, ok
5538
you know...
5538
now we have all lost guardians
5538
dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\
5538
and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians
5538
i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes
5538
......
5538
i am so sad
5538
rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am
5538
oh
5538
well
5538
i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash
5538
yeaaah...
5538
errrr, i dont know?
5538
wellllll
5538
no!
5538
but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope
5538
hm
5538
then what will you do?
5538
what does that mean!
5538
oh no no no no no!
5538
rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!
5538
he would probably kill you!
5538
i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it
5538
what? who?
5538
aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????
5538
rose who is this!
5538
i dont even know whats going on anymore
5538
SHHHHHHHHHH!
5538
please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight
5538
nooo :(
5538
rose, maybe white text guy is right?
5538
the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...
5538
but what if they are not actually good?
5538
no...
5538
but i still dont trust them!
5538
whats this weirdo talking about!
5538
oh yeah
5538
i noticed you found it!
5538
i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up
5538
is he saying you can use it?
5538
omg
5538
does it work???
5538
then maybe you should try it!
5538
well
5538
since we dont know much about the gods...
5538
why dont you ask it about them?
5538
i guess that is a way to put it
5589
john!!! i am worried about rose!
5589
im pretty sure she is on her way there to look for jack!
5589
i cant say for sure because i cant see her with my goggles anymore for some reason, but i am fearing the worst
5589
just in case, you should to try to intercept her before she does something stupid like try to fight him!!!!!
5589
also, um...
5589
i guess you probably still dont know about your dad yet do you?
5589
darn, why do i always have to be the one to break terrible news :(
5589
er
5589
john?
5590
oh god please dont tell me your computer was in the wallet you just gave that guy.....
5590
dammit john!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5590
one of these days you will learn the value of having plenty of backup computers
5590
in fact whenever you finally leave the battlefield i am going to give you the code for a nice pair of lunchmuffs
5590
and then i am going to force you to keep them on your head AT ALL TIMES!
5590
yeah, youre never going to read this are you :|
5872
pw.
5872
listen fuckass
5872
i am going to need a password before we continue
5872
plz <3
5872
....................... :|
5872
no karkat, that was not quite the password
5872
but you were on the right track :p
5872
do you even remember the right password?
5872
youre being deliberately dumb
5872
it was...
5872
IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF?
5872
remember?
5872
i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez.
5873
i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system?
5873
why would i want to do that??
5873
the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!
5873
i have this on good authority from both sources
5873
you see, that is your problem
5873
okay, one of your many, many problems...
5873
you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!
5873
even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before
5873
it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing
5873
so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!
5873
its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out
5873
exactly :D
5873
ok
5873
yes
5873
yes, we still are!
5873
this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.
5873
i can understand her just fine!
5873
we already talked about this
5873
echidna and i have an understanding now ;)
5873
well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly
5873
you might have actually learned something!!!!!!
5873
did you ever talk to kanaya about it?
5873
her situation was very similar to mine
5873
it doesnt sound like you got the whole story
5873
or maybe you just werent listening to her :p
5873
this was kanayas suggestion
5873
yes!
5873
im talking to her right now actually
5873
durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius
5873
a few hours in your future!
5873
you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you
5873
she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all
5873
it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!
5873
yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!
5873
but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask
5873
siiign, what are you even talking about?
5873
aw
5873
well...
5873
youll find him
5873
i know, i made an exception
5873
but only one!
5873
kanaya thinks we should all talk about this
5873
she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy
5873
:x!!!!!
5873
she is opening a memo
6001
oh sorry!
6001
i was distracted
6001
no not by all the scratchy stuff in the sky
6001
theres something coming down...
6002
its hard to make out
6002
but
6002
i think
6002
it might be...
6003
shaving cream?
6004
its like
6004
hey!
6004
...
6004
karkat?
6196
im not sure!
6196
some sort of limbo dimension between the two walls i guess
6196
like a realm with unusual spatial properties we have to cross through
6196
yes!
6196
we still totally exist john
6197
about what?
6197
yes
6197
i didnt make it with witch powers though, i captchalogued it hours ago because karkat told me to...
6197
then at the last minute i took it out and made it huge so we could escape through it
6197
i did make it huge with witch powers!
6197
they also make things small
6197
yup
6197
also
6197
witch powers can teleport things, and fling things around through space at very high velocities
6197
all sorts of stuff!
6197
but to be honest, im not sure how much of that is attributable to inheriting becs abilities...
6197
yes that was the basic idea
6197
that would be jake
6197
and yeah, i do believe we will meet him in this session
6197
he said he had a bunch of friends who helped him make the bunny! im pretty excited to meet them all
6197
actually, they both went, and in a manner of speaking, their mission was a success
6197
nope!
6197
they did not actually destroy the sun. trust me, i would know if it was gone. now that i know what i know, it was kind of silly of us to think it would ever be destroyed...
6197
and as it happens, rose and dave are not dead either! i have received very reliable reports that they survived
6197
it will all be more clear soon
6197
ive learned a lot in my dreams lately
6197
heh, probably more than i ever learned looking at the clouds on prospit!
6197
when i was dead there for a few minutes, i had one last very informative nap
6197
the bottom line is, rose and dave will rendezvous with the trolls near the green sun, and then they will all meet us in the new session
6198
its through the other wall!
6198
yes
6198
no, not lawn ring!
6198
thats a silly troll word
6198
its the yellow yard
6198
we have to cross it to break through the next wall
6198
see that long yellow band down there, stretching between the two walls?
6198
i think thats supposed to be the yard
6198
hmmm
6198
yeah i think youre right
6198
kinda like the yellow brick road?
6198
hehe
6200
:|
6200
i have no idea
6200
extra dimensional shenanigan based phenomena perhaps?????
6202
i dont know!
6202
:?
6202
yes me too
6202
hmmmmmm
6203
im just trying to estimate our arrival time
6203
based on our current velocity, which is about as close to light speed as i can make it go
6203
hmmmmmmmmmmm...
6203
no
6203
itll take quite a bit longer than that
6203
i would say
6203
if i keep our speed constant...
6203
we should arrive in about three years
6204
i know!
6204
i cant!
6204
not here, at least
6204
the way i understand it is...
6204
becs powers draw from the green sun
6204
and the green sun presides over our universe
6204
many universes actually! and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them
6204
including the trolls universe and their session
6204
think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes
6204
it is!
6204
so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light
6204
jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i
6204
but we could only teleport locally
6204
which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session
6204
and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it
6204
we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy
6204
and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else!
6204
for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain
6204
it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist
6204
so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less
6204
and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either
6204
so the same rules apply
6204
yes i think youre right
6204
but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank!
6204
some really creepy omniscient guy
6204
it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now
6204
yes, but its not all as bad as it seems
6204
theres a silver lining in all of this
6204
like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important
6204
who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed
6204
or maybe worse, if it never existed at all
6204
which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success!
6204
to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity
6204
and then create the sun in the first place
6204
that is what the tumor was for all along
6204
like i said
6204
we got played like a bunch of suckers!!!
6236
i think he looks cool!!!!!
6236
the cape is great, hes like a super hero now
6236
yup
6236
...
6236
:(
6236
!!!
6236
...........
6236
how did you know about that!
6236
oh
6236
that figures
6236
umm
6236
yeah
6236
i dunno
6236
do you want it to come true?
6236
hmmmmmm.....
6236
i think i miss them already
6236
and weve only been here for a few minutes :(
6236
well
6236
you could ask them now if you want
6237
yes
6237
in fact
6237
you can hop right through me and join them
6237
then you can travel with them to the new session if you like
6237
it probably would!
6237
but i cant go with you
6237
i can serve as a gateway
6237
but i cant travel to the sun myself, remember?
6237
but its ok, really!
6237
if thats what you wanted to do, i wouldnt mind
6237
but whatever you do, you have to decide quickly
6237
they will be departing from the sun very soon
6237
i wouldnt really be alone though
6238
i have the population of five planets to keep me company!
6238
awww :D
6238
ok then
6238
personally, i think this trip could be a lot of fun!
6238
theres no pressure to do anything important or run around like lunatics anymore
6238
we can just relax
6238
woof!
6238
whoops
6238
there should be lots of good stuff on the planets
6238
also i would bet this ship is stocked with plenty of military rations
6238
oh yeah!!!
6238
durrr, problem solved
6238
yes
6238
im pretty sure she knows a ton of things now
6238
considering she is a fully realized seer of light
6238
im sure that would be hilarious
6238
but
6238
if you go i dont think i can bring you back
6238
i cant bring anyone or anything to here from there!
6238
as far as i know...
6238
if theres a way i havent figured it out yet
6238
i am still kind of new to this omnipotence thing after all :\
6238
i dont know!
6238
im sure the rules exist for a good reason though
6238
maybe to somewhat limit the power and reach of omnipotent beings?
6238
if there are no limits at all, it could be especially dangerous in the wrong hands
6238
like what happened with jack!
6238
then i guess thats what we are!
6238
semipotent demigods
6238
woof woof woof!
6238
dammit!!!!!!
6238
i havent gotten the hang of the woofs yet :(
6238
i think so
6238
i do too!
6238
D:
6239
sure!
6239
better hurry up and write it though
6240
how about this one?
6240
looks like its still in pretty good condition
6241
john you have to hurry!
6242
here, will this work?
6242
whatever you write just make it quick!
6242
and tell everyone i say hi!
6242
ok, while you work on that, i think ill bring up some friends
6242
you know, let some of our travel companions get acquainted with the ship!
6243
shooooooooosh!!!!!
6243
write now, catch up later!
6244
nooooo come on guys theyre about to go just stuff it in the bucket and throw it at me already!!!
6629
john i really think we are scraping the bottom of the barrel here
6629
thats sort of my point!
6629
where did you even get this?
6629
:|
6630
i dont really think this is my kind of game....
6630
but i will play it with you today because it is technically your birthday <3
6630
how many people did you get to play this??
6630
why cant you cross the streams?
6630
:p
6631
im working on it!
6631
there are so many options
6631
what kind of ghostbuster should i make?
6631
hmmmm
6631
what do you have to do?
6631
noooooooooo!
6631
sure john
6631
whatever you say
6631
are you serious?
6631
what about that fire pole there?
6631
cant you go down the fire pole?
6631
.........
6631
yeah i think im done!!!
6631
im pretty happy with him
6632
no way!
6632
hes adorable, what are you even talking about?
6632
i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him
6632
i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible
6632
nope. im keeping him :p
6632
shut up or ill give him a pink jumpsuit!
6632
i think i will manage to survive the embarrassment in front of a bunch of salamanders and crocodiles
6632
thank you
6632
*snicker*
6632
nothing
6632
hehe
6632
pffff!
6632
its davesprite, hes playing too
6632
we have strategies?
6632
hahahahahahaha
6632
did you know...
6632
davesprite is a funny guy?
6632
i just told him you said that
6632
davesprite says to tell you "youre basically welcome for being born 14 years ago and 1 year ago you ungrateful douche"
6632
um
6632
because he is davesprite?
6632
well yeah
6632
but hes kinda different from dave
6632
i know
6632
but there are other differences...
6633
its hard to explain
6633
just some slight differences in personality i guess
6633
yes...
6633
so?
6633
ok i will admit i cant really tell if his rapping style has changed
6633
i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite
6633
or because he lived for a while in a different timeline...
6633
i wasnt a sprite!
6633
my dead dream self was a sprite
6633
and then i kind of merged with her when i became a god tier
6633
i guess?
6633
its more like im still the me i always was, but inherited some of her memories
6633
but they are pretty vague
6633
i remember being dead for a long time
6633
and making friends...
6633
mostly trolls
6633
none that we know of now
6633
that i can remember at least
6633
they feel like such distant memories, like they were barely real
6633
yeah me too
6633
maybe its something about this place were traveling through?
6633
when was the last time you visited one in your sleep?
6633
yeah
6633
yup
6634
nope :(
6634
i dont think thats it
6634
for one thing, considering where we are, i dont think theres such a thing as "the same time" for us
6634
maybe...
6634
but its probably more like the way it used to be with the clouds in skaia
6634
they didnt always show you things, but when they did they were selective about what they would let you see
6634
like they would make sure you saw whatever you needed to see to make sure things would go the right way
6634
i always thought i knew so much, but in retrospect they gave me only a tiny glimpse of the big picture!
6634
i guess!
6634
it never felt that way when all i was doing was looking up at some clouds
6634
i was happy to see whatever was there
6634
but i guess its different in a situation like this
6634
when you miss your friends, and you kind of wish the dream bubbles would play along
6635
heheh, probably!
6635
hmmm
6635
well look at it this way
6635
by the end of our trip, will YOU be better friends with a bunch of salamanders than you are with rose and dave?
6635
that is true
6635
umm
6635
what do you mean the way things are going?
6635
what!
6635
what has he been telling you??
6635
well...
6635
i guess i dont know whats going on with that
6635
i really dont!!!
6635
um
6635
what
6635
do you think he would think about that?
6635
the other dave
6635
i mean
6635
hypothetically
6635
im only wondering because you brought it up!!!!!!
6635
then what do you think?
6635
maybe
6635
well
6635
what about you john?
6636
remember how you told me how karkat kept sort of trying to set you up with rose?
6636
you told me this on more than one occasion if i recall!
6636
well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true...
6636
not at all! that is perfectly fine
6636
aww
6636
heheheheh
6636
what?
6636
*snicker*
6636
i guess you have a point
6636
mm hm
6636
yikes
6636
.....
6636
that was just my hunch
6636
i sincerely doubt it
6636
at least
6636
i hope not ._.
6636
that is so outrageous
6636
after you!
6637
grrr...
6637
grrrrrrrrrrr
6637
i cant help it!
6637
grrrr...
6637
dammit!
6637
im really not mad at him, i swear!
6637
WOOF!!!
6638
WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF!
7184
hm?
7186
what?
7188
whaaat
7188
but you love this movie!
7188
but you were making such a big deal about finally getting me to watch it with you on your birthday!
7188
you were going on and on about how i wouldnt be disappointed... but now youre saying you dont like it?
7188
really?
7188
i was actually kind of enjoying it!
7188
its very silly
7188
i really dont think its the kind of movie youre supposed to take all that seriously john
7188
i dunno....
7188
but people can change their minds about things
7188
i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie
7188
i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young
7188
but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was
7188
i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise
7188
and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas.....
7188
so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it
7188
i still loved all the cute characters and could enjoy it on a nostalgic level
7188
what is even the problem with it?
7188
ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie...
7188
its funny!
7189
but he was trying to sound like a hardened criminal to win the trust of john malkovich!
7189
what!!
7189
you spent your whole life worshiping this dumb movie and now youre calling ME naive????
7189
oh god
7189
vexing and hypnotic??
7189
its a movie full of explosions about a guy with a mullet
7189
what is with you lately? you seem to be in such a crappy mood these days
7189
oh bluh bluh
7189
can we just finish the rest of the movie?
7190
look you made us miss a whole bunch of stuff!
7190
hang on im going to rewind it...
7190
whos dave chappelle?
7190
no!!!
7190
dont touch the remote
7190
YES :p
7190
john you are kind of sounding like a crazy person here
7190
what???
7191
oh...
7191
heh
7191
yeah
7191
why do you always call him dave sprite?
7191
no, i mean why do you always say it like that? with the space between words?
7191
its not dave sprite, its just davesprite
7191
yeah.... john
7191
i dont think davesprite is coming tonight
7192
no...
7192
it has nothing to do with jaspers
7192
he uh...
7192
kind of broke up with me
7193
a couple days ago
7193
john its ok you dont have t...
7193
we were?
7193
your rock??
7193
what are you talking about?
7193
we were not an institution!
7193
you are just saying meaningless things now
7193
um...
7193
its complicated
7193
basically hes just going through a lot of stuff right now
7193
do uh...
7193
you have a girlfriend?
7193
i dont think hes a douche, hes just...
7194
i dont think being a bird ever bothered him
7194
like i said... its all more complicated than that
7194
me too
7194
why?
7194
i dont know
7194
what do you mean
7194
uh
7194
so
7194
SO WHAT IF HE HAS A GHOST BUTT!!!!!
7194
WHATEVER YOURE JUST SAYING, JUST STOP SAYING IT!
7194
and whatever youre trying to gesture with your hands there, stop doing that too!
7194
nope!!! totally not talking about this
7194
put your hands down john
7195
thats not down, thats up!
7195
oh well, at least youre not making those unsettling gestures...
7195
john...
7195
what are you doing?
7195
i hope youre not entertaining some awkward train of thought about, uh...
7195
what is with you??
7195
today is your birthday, youre supposed to be having fun!
7195
but youve been so testy, as if youre committed to not having a good time
7195
yeah, i can see how you might find it a little slow here
7195
i dunno, i havent minded much... maybe its different for me though because i used to live all alone?
7195
but i dont mind doing that any time!!!
7195
john... if you told me this earlier i would have...
7195
were already going as fast as i can make us go
7195
about the speed of light!
7195
no! nothing can go faster than light john
7195
unless you teleport of course
7195
i already explained this! i cant do that here, its not within the domain of the green sun which gives me those powers!
7195
no thats just a regular law of physics!!! jeez
7195
ok first of all, thats not even close to the speed of light
7195
light travels at a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second no matter what frame of reference youre in... even this one!
7195
second of all special relativity and comparing laws of physics between different frames of reference, those are tricky issues to talk about!
7195
but id be more than happy to talk about them if youd like. actually i would enjoy that because i never really get to talk about science wi...
7195
yes as a matter of fact it is!
7195
you take that back!!!!!
7195
john.....
7195
what is that?
7196
under your hood...
7196
looks like a piece of paper stuck to your back?
7199
what?
7199
what is it??
7200
where are you going?
7200
what! john, no...
7201
ok yes, that practical joke is in poor taste, but you should try to calm down and...
7201
um
7201
which one?
7201
sigh
7202
:|
7204
john...
7204
theres no one there
7205
what pastures
7205
what
7205
wasnt i supposed to be the mule?
7205
i dont think i understand your analogy
7205
....
7206
john i think youre officially throwing a tantrum here
7206
...
7206
john?
7207
john...
7207
are you asleep?
7207

long time no see
8188
woof
8189
yes i just woofed
8189
yes i can talk in person language
8189
oh dont worry...
8189
i will say lots of person things to you
8189
for you see roxy
8190
we have many person things to discuss
8191
excuse me but did you just "laugh your ass off" at me under your breath
8191
:|
8191
i fail to see what is so amusing
8191
.....
8191
ok i guess the situation is a little funny because of this absurd folder
8191
and the fact that i woofed at you probably didnt help either
8191
but im not here to share a good laugh over the old ladys sense of design or her penchant for scrapbooking!
8191
i am here to make sure that you do as youre told
8191
now take the file and review your assignment
8191
yes you will
8191
no
8191
thats what he told me when we were pen pals
8191
but i think its more accurate to say im his alternate universe biological daughter
8191
yes, it does :p
8191
now take the damn folder
8191
DO NOT CALL ME THAT!!!
8191
my surname is harley not english
8191
but you may refer to me as jade, or ma'am if you are feeling especially nervous and deferential
8191
which as it turns out is the way you should be feeling about me, ALWAYS >:B
8191
lol WHAT
8192
SILENCE!!!!!!
8192
open the file
8192
OPEN IT!
8193
yes
8193
it is not impossible
8193
you are the rogue of void
8193
dont you know what that means?
8193
it means a lot more than that
8193
your true powers are more impressive than those of anyone else in your crappy quartet
8193
in fact i would say they are almost as cool as mine >:)
8193
not just spikeballs!
8193
imagine that your title is roughly synonymous with "one who steals nothing"
8193
what do you think it means to be able to steal nothing?
8193
WRONG
8193
it means just the opposite
8193
it means you can steal the essence of nothingness from something
8193
you can rob nothingness from an idea if you put your mind to it
8193
effectively allowing you to conjure virtually anything out of thin air
8193
grrrrr...
8193
im sorry, but your remarks of self deprecation made me very angry
8193
once i was even more of a dork than you
8193
but now i am one of the most powerful beings who has ever existed
8193
i dont want to hear any whining about what you think you cant do
8193
you are hereby under strict orders from myself and her condescension to "clam up" and conjure that orb, do you understand?
8193
you tell me
8193
space is my racket, not void
8193
its called the matriorb
8193
it is the key to resurrecting the troll race
8193
once you create it the empress will hatch it on an uninhabited planet located beyond the reach of her cruel employer
8193
there her people will have another chance to thrive without the ever looming threat of extinction that comes with his influence
8193
so you see roxy, there is nothing noble about refusing to help
8193
once an entire alien race went extinct because of a terrible monster, and you can help give them a second chance
8193
dont you want that?
8193
yes fair enough, but heres the other thing...
8193
if you dont i am going to kill you
8193
oh yesses!
8193
a literal plurality of yesses
8193
seeing as you are a god tier it is very likely you will come back to life
8193
so i can just keep killing you over and over a different way each time
8193
maybe i will disembowel you a few times
8193
i will not even need to use my sharp doggy teeth!
8193
i will just snap my fingers and your delicious guts will teleport outside your body
8193
no way more like yum
8193
i will just keep on killing you again and again
8193
until you finally get tired of dying and follow your orders
8193
i believe you will find i am the suckiest jade there is
8193
now we are going to be here in this cell for as long as it takes
8193
i am not going anywhere until you try doing your voidey thing and make something appear
8193
is that understood?
8195
no, its not
8195
thats a perfectly generic object
8195
yes
8195
thats what a perfectly generic object is
8195
how
8195
exactly
8195
if you want your powers to reach their full potential youre going to need to become more familiar with the fundamental building blocks of ideas and how they translate into more complicated thoughts and forms
8195
then it becomes a simple matter of using your abilities to snatch those concepts from unreality
8195
we both know you dont think its too hard, you think it sounds like an interesting challenge
8195
this is a very good start though
8195
with a little practice im sure our empress will have her orb in no time
8196
it would be fairly baller
8196
keep trying for that orb though
8196
i will return in a while to review your progress
8196
and remember, dont get any funny ideas
8196
i mean dont try to escape!
8196
even if you are invisible i will be able to track you down instantly
8196
my sense of smell is very good
8196
now if youll excuse me i have some business to attend to
8197
i am still trying to locate my brother
8197
but im having trouble picking up his scent
8197
hes using his windy powers to obscure the trail and its giving me fits
8197
woof!!!
8197
i mean shoosh :x
8197
that is enough questions from you
8197
now i believe you have a space egg to conjure
8197
what?
8197
farewell roxy
8217
hello dave
8218
he was just here wasnt he
8218
how do you even know who im talking about??
8218
dave i know he was just here
8218
i can smell him
8218
degbear?
8218
what...
8218
ah
8218
you cant fool me dave
8218
i will track him down sooner or later
8218
in any case it doesnt matter
8218
i came here to see you, not him
8218
come with me
8219
out here
8219
we have some work to do
8220
youre going to need to upgrade your weapon
8220
yes
8220
that may very well be the case
8220
but it will be useless against lord english
8220
wouldnt you prefer a weapon that is capable of inflicting damage against him?
8220
of course you would
8220
this isnt even up for discussion
8220
now give me the deringer
8220
we have all been traveling for three long years. what better way to celebrate our reunion than with a little alchemy? :)
8220
HAR HAR
8220
gimme the sword
8221
it needs a special ingredient
8221
something which represents his only known weakness, but hasnt been properly weaponized
8221
i do
8221
i get all my intelligence on such matters from the old lady
8221
shes had centuries to hatch a plan to settle her score
8221
over time shes uncovered many secrets about him
8221
that is not relevant!
8221
bark bark bark!!!
8221
i already have it right here
8221
in fact ive had it for about as long as i can remember
8221
it was right under my doggy snout all along
8222
remember this?
8222
dave are you lying to me?
8222
but i found it on your planet
8222
it must have gotten here somehow
8222
its not an egg!
8222
you really have a one track mind when it comes to certain things
8222
davesprite was like that too... i just figured it was because he was part bird
8222
but no, here you are going on about bird things too just like him :p
8222
mm hmm
8222
and just because i have these pointy ears doesnt mean i wouldnt kill for some snausages right now!
8222
.....................
8222
maybe ._.
8222
its a cueball dave!
8222
sigh
8222
i see its still impossible to have a serious conversation with you, whether you are a sassy bird or not
8222
i thought regular dave might have matured a little over three years but i guess i was wrong
8223
pardon?
8223
are you telling me you have seen this sword before dave
8223
how is that possible?
8223
.....
8223
you sure seem to break swords a lot
8223
:|
8223
dave i admit this is a peculiar turn of events, but i think you are overreacting
8223
omg
8223
youve really spent way too much time alone with karkat havent you
8225
what this?
8225
earth
8226
its small because i shrunk it
8226
cause im a space witch
8226
duhhh
8226
he did
8226
but i snuck through a portal and nabbed it!
8226
then i hopped right back through the gate before everything blew up
8226
i was in and out like a bandit
8226
you know, i like to think i make a pretty good witch, especially since i turned wicked and all...
8226
but maybe i would have made an even better thief!
8226
what do you think jane? do you think i missed my true calling?
8226
come to think of it, the new empire probably doesnt need anymore thieves
8226
we already have the greatest thief of all running the show
8226
she even managed to steal both of us away from all our pals, didnt she jane? ;)
8226
hehe
8226
isnt she a riot guys?
8227
it wont be earth for much longer
8227
it will be home to the new empire
8227
i will deliver it to the universe we create
8227
or i should say the one YOU create
8227
if you are obedient and complete the tasks you are assigned, you may have a place in the empire among the subservient classes
8227
karkat i had almost forgotten how much i missed our repartee
8227
thank you for reminding me, that outburst was beautiful
8227
if youre frustrated by the way im treating you look at it this way... im not asking you for passwords anymore am i?
8227
sorry karkat, there is no password. not this time
8227
if you continue to list meat products then im afraid the only thing you will unlock is my fearsome doggy hunger
8227
and believe me, you dont want to see me when im doggy hungry
8227
but if you insist on hounding me (hehe) for some sort of explanation, its all pretty simple
8227
we all recently arrived in this brand new session... janes session actually
8227
this is jane btw. say hi jane
8227
lol
8227
jane is actually my biological mother believe it or not
8227
shh!
8227
but her session was taken over by the woman who you might call our mutual great grandmother
8227
shes an alien. a very powerful troll queen actually
8227
karkat you are the one who demanded an "UNINTERRUPTED SPATE OF HARD, UNEMBELLISHED DATA"
8227
ill thank you to not to yell at me for doing exactly what you requested
8227
her imperious condescension is in control now
8227
she intends to carry out the remaining objectives to complete the session
8227
those tasks will be distributed among several recently recruited agents of course
8227
(thats you!)
8227
this should come as a relief to you since it means you and she are not in opposition at all
8227
in fact you share all the same goals!
8227
the only difference is that when the time comes she will be the one claiming the ultimate reward
8227
the spoils will be hers not ours... get it?
8227
excellent
8227
what you will need to do is ready the young frog for its journey to skaia
8227
i will prepare skaia to receive it by deploying the battlefield from our old session
8227
this will bring fertility to the void session and allow the frog to mature when he completes his journey
8227
no!
8227
i already made one actually
8227
dont you remember??
8227
really your job is so easy
8227
theres no more frog breeding involved at all
8227
when the time is right, you just have to release the one thats already there
8227
it fell into the forge
8227
in the years since it has sunk all the way down to the planets core
8227
but as it happens that is exactly where it should be!
8227
my denizen is now guarding it
8227
as im sure kanaya already knows it will not be released unless you travel there and formally request that she do so
8227
i already did
8227
echidna will not speak with me
8227
it is not important why, and it changes nothing
8227
she said she would only speak with another hero of space
8227
that would be kanaya
8227
she also cryptically requested the presence of the knight who once helped her with breeding duties
8227
karkat i gather that would be you
8227
i dont know karkat
8227
that is your problem, not mine
8227
maybe you should try feeling grateful she asked for you
8227
youre getting the chance to set right what went so horribly wrong
8227
to atone for your hasty first attempt at frog breeding which resulted in a terminal universe
8227
if i were you i would feel pretty relieved to get a second chance, but thats just me :p
8228
i would be careful about the slurs you bandy about, particularly those targeting my canine qualities which i am sensitive about and therefore find to be really really mean
8228
you should be aware that i have already threatened to kill some people today so watch your step mister
8228
its true though i am very threatening
8228
and this girl right here?
8228
shes even worse
8228
she hasnt even said a WORD... that is TERRIFYING!
8228
jeez even im nervous
8228
and kanaya dont think you are safe from our threats just because you happen to be a vampire
8228
we have ways of handling the undead
8228
jane here?
8228
she has the power to bring people back to life
8228
although it is my understanding that this ability is limited to a one time only use per individual
8228
you do know what sort of effect her resurrection spell will have on undead targets...
8229
you dont?
8229
i thought it was common knowledge
8229
when you cast healing magic on a zombie or dracula they die!
8229
i dont know...
8229
isnt that how it works in stories and games and such
8229
seems pretty logical to me
8229
SIIIGH
8229
i can see a demonstration will be in order
8229
jane
8229
if you would be so kind
8232
GOTCHA!!!!!
8233
john stop that
8238
no wait!
8239
EEEEEEGBEEEERRRRRRRRT!!!!!
8239
oh i am so mad
8239
grrrrr....
8239
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
8240
AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
8283
her imperious condescension has duly noted your ridiculous tantrum
8283
now take your welsh sword
8283
since you have obviously been identified as the one who must deal english his fatal blow we will need to make sure you are battle ready
8283
and you do not seem very battle ready to me dave
8283
show me what you can do
8283
i will not hear another word of such appalling slander about this fine weapon
8283
its colorful and its silly and its a sword
8283
end of story
8283
as for why i can wield it, i surpassed the need for a strife specibus quite some time ago
8283
havent you climbed any more god tiers over the last few years?
8283
what were you even doing on that meteor
8283
what badges do you have on your kiddie camper handysash?
8283
i asked you first
8283
dave
8283
we both know neither the kiddie camper handysash nor the badges sewn onto it are real objects
8283
yeah...
8284
why not?
8284
our empress can hardly have a knight with such rusty combat skills in her service
8284
en garde!
8284
im gonna go through the vaguely nefarious motions of kicking your ass in a minute if you dont put up your dukes!!!
8284
by using your time trickery!
8284
come on dave do your timey thing
8284
get creative, make lots of copies of yourself or something... outsmart me!
8284
yes!!!
8284
!!!!!
8284
grrr
8284
dave, just try a little time travel to get this fight started
8284
see look, one of your time doubles is surely predestined to come from a few minutes in the future and appear behind me for a surprise attack, riiiight about...
8284
now!
8284
...
8284
no wait
8284
riiiiiiiiiight...
8284
...
8284
...
8284
NOW!
8284
....
8284
.....
8284
dave why is your future self being such a wet blanket
8284
:\
8285
......
8285
sorry dave, you lost me there after the part where i shot you
8285
omg, no!
8285
the fact is youre going to have to rely on those powers if you want to stand any chance against a lord of time
8285
it is safe to expect he can only be challenged by someone with a similar command over the aspect
8285
dave i am perfectly aware of the awesome powers granted to me by the bark side
8285
it does not matter
8285
i cant be the one to wield your sword against english
8285
it has to be you
8285
it is the will of the empress, and thats final
8286
jeez you sure have some issues
8286
honestly it has become very tiresome listening to this sort of thing
8286
i thought davesprite had problems
8286
his issues i could kind of understand
8286
i thought you might be different, being the alpha dave and all
8286
but no
8286
you might be even more messed up inside than he was!
8286
none of your business >:p
8286
that doesnt make any sense!
8286
augh!
8286
forget i mentioned it
8286
dont say that, you arent the real dave!
8286
well you are, but phrasing it like that is so mean!
8286
hes just as real as you, and when you imply he isnt you sound like a jerk!!!
8286
THE ONLY REASON I THINK YOURE A NEUROTIC DOUCHE IS BECAUSE YOURE ACTING LIKE ONE NOW!!!
8286
YOU BROKE MY HEART!!!!!!
8286
ok not you
8286
davesprite did
8286
BUT YOURE BASICALLY THE SAME GUY!
8286
you just said you had a right to know what happened between us because, and i quote, "hes bird me"
8286
*growl*
8286
*SNARL*
8286
*sigh*
8287
dave, i did my best to put all this behind me a long time ago
8287
i did not come here to dredge up any of this drama with you
8287
besides, such behavior is unbecoming of her condescensions loyal subordinates
8287
you can be stubborn all you want, but i will force you to comply with her wishes one way or another
8287
it will be quite easy actually
8287
all i have to do is target the people you care about most
8287
he is a very cute mayor
8287
it therefore pains me to have to do this
8294
why is being a bad guy SO HARD?
8302
see look, one of your time doubles is surely predestined to come from a few minutes in the future and appear behind me for a surprise attack, riiiight about...
8302
now!
8302
...
8302
no wait
8302
riiiiiiiiiight...
8302
...
8302
...
8302
NOW!
8302
....
8302
.....
8302
dave why is your future self being such a wet blanket
8302
:\
8304
yeah john
8304
did you really have to pick now of all times to materialize out of nowhere and taunt me?
8304
so what now?
8304
am i REALLY supposed to tackle you, just to watch you vanish yet again?
8304
because i dont really feel like it
8304
do you have any idea how frustrating that becomes after a while?
8304
>:o
8304
sigh
8304
yes, unfortunately thats probably where this was going
8304
yes
8304
i was going to kick the mayor into the lava
8304
i was going to make it clear i was serious about killing someone you cared about
8304
so you would stop being a baby and start using your powers and swordfight with me you dumb jerk :p
8304
thank you :)
8304
oh yes absolutely
8304
he would be burnt to a crisp right now i am sure of it
8304
no you wouldnt you were just going to argue with me forever!
8304
i guess not
8304
he is a very cute mayor after all
8304
sorry john
8304
whatever dave and i were going to argue about
8304
i think the moment has passed
8304
the whole thing is kind of ruined to be honest
8470
yes :B
8470
what is it
8487
who took my ship??
8487
that is SO illegal
8487
maybe we should call in some authority regulators to have it ticketed and towed
8487
yes
8487
but i love watching those guys write their little tickets
8487
theyre so cute
8488
do you think we should ask the condesce what to do?
8488
yes youre right
8488
what would she think if we went whimpering to her every time some buffoon parked a battleship illegally
8488
yeah
8488
hmm
8488
maybe we should check on the prisoners again
8488
whoa
8489
something is happening...
8509
ok!
8512
sorry jake you heard the lady
8512
youre making a royal mess of the place
8512

8516
to penetrate...
8516
THE HOPE FIELD!!!
8516
*pant pant*
8516
ALSO HE KEEPS DOING THAT!!!
8518
alright jake
8518

8518
if i cant zap you out of here then i have no choice but to let you stay
8518
but i cant allow you to keep trashing the old ladys property
8518
so ill just swap the planets instead!
8519
dont you remember when we used to be pen pals jake?
8519
how many times did i help you solve a tricky problem?
8519
i am very very clever
8519
whereas you...
8519
lets face it
8519

8526
oh my god
8526

8526

8527
hey i asked you a question gramps!
8527
YOU CALL THAT POWERING UP?
8527
i will show you the true meaning of powering up
8527

8528
RRRR!
8528
RRRRRRRAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR!!
8528
RRRRRRRRRRAAAAAWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
8529

8532

8616
thats ok im in no hurry to go yet
8616
or for that matter, to remember why im here
8616
i cant put my finger on it
8616
but i have this awful feeling something bad happened
8616
specifically something that happened because of me
8616
yeah :(
8616
im worried i may have done some things i wouldnt be proud of
8616
that maybe i could have even...
8616
hurt some people
8616
i hope its just my imagination
8616
in any case i feel like i could use some rest
8616
and you seem very nice
8616
so id rather relax here with you for a while than jump right back into...
8616
whatever craziness is waiting for me out there
8616
by the way, i didnt catch your name...
8616
your trollsona?
8616
nice to meet you too callie :)
8616
but
8616
what is a trollsona?
8616
oh
8616
OH!
8616
i get it... you are not really a troll?
8616
omg she is so cute
8616
or i should say
8616
YOU are so cute!
8616
what a good idea
8616
do you think i could make a trollsona too?
8616
sure!
8616
the BEST color obviously
8616
which is green, DUH :p
8616
wow really??
8616
thats perfect
8616
our trollsonas can be like
8616
blood sisters or such
8616
i dont know enough about troll culture to use proper terminology...
8616
but lets just say thats what we are
8616
what should my horns look like?
8616
oh and for that matter
8616
should i have horns instead of my dog ears, or in addition to them?
8616
ok
8616
hmm where would they go though...
8616
jeez i think we might need to do some drawings to make her look right
8617
callie...
8617
there is something very familiar about you
8617
are you sure weve never met before?
8617
but you did know my name...
8617
hmmm
8617
i cant shake the feeling that we have spoken before
8617
maybe in an old dream i cant remember?
8617
im not sure if its the sound of your voice or what
8617
i dont recognize your face, but then thats not what you really look like is it?
8617
...
8617
thats fine!
8617
its not a big deal
8617
if its true that weve met before, im sure ill remember in due time
8617
lets not worry about it for now
8617
by the way
8617
what is with this stage?
8617
is it from one of your memories?
8617
i dont think so
8617
it would seem to be some sort of imaginary figment that turned into a real object
8617
i wonder why it looks like a drawing?
8617
hey why dont you come up here and help me get these curtains open
8617
since its the only thing weve got in this boring vortex we might as well try to have a little fun!
